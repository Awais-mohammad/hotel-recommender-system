116973608,"The Hostel is in a pretty good location, about a 15 min walk from the airport and the directions were pretty good. and then about a 10 min walk to the Tower and only a 2 min walk to the train station. The Room wasnt the best, we stayed in a female dorm on the ground floor and didn't seem very secure, the room door didn't have a lock and the front door of the hostel was open all the time. The room had a locker for everyone, however the one we were allocated didnt lock. Not the cleanist place, I got bed bugs here. The bathrooms werent the best either, there was 2 dorms on the ground floor and only 2 bathrooms. There was no water pressure at all, had to have a cold shower.",-1,0,0.687222222
93875484,the place is clean and the staff friendly but three big minus: 1. they charge us (3 persons) ten euros meanwhile other guests in the dorm told us that they paid seven euros 2. and it was too hot so we hard couldn't sleep. Imagine how it is in the summer! The ventilation is bad.3. we couldn't sleep neither 'cause there's a highway right next to the hostel so we heard all night all traffic rush by ;-((,-1,2,0.370238095
119887660,"Wanted to stay in the hostel for two nights together with some friends. I have stayed in many hostels before but this was the worst ever. When I woke up I saw bed bugs on my bed. Stitches on my whole body. It was so itchy! Please do not stay in this hostel to avoid spreading those bed bugs to other hostels or your home! The bathroom was old, the shower was cold and unhygienic. I stayed there in octobre and there were some strange people in the hostel who were definitely no backpackers or tourists. It was very loud at night because of the railway tracks behind the hostel and the motorway. I liked the free wifi and the dinner though. The location  was okay: close to the airport and station but a little far from the city centre (~35 min walk). nevertheless: absolutely disgusting!",-1,5,0.6515625
218862698,"I stayed at Galileo for one night. I dont really know how they got 4 stars. The photos dont show the reality: is a first floor of a old building, bad decorated. You can hear everthing from other rooms, or in my case, from my room, i would wake up everytime someone would enter the hotel. And for me the worst point is definitely the lack of cleaness, cause I think is totaly unacceptable to pay the price you pay and notice that the floor, the bath arent clean.For being fair, i would have to say that the girl at the reception desk was nice and kind, and that was the only positive thing.",-1,1,0.635037879
4354038,Very noisy at night. Beds are very small - I'm 5'6&quot; and my feet were hanging out of the end! The walls were like paper so you can feel very intimate with your neighbours. Shower is poor. Convenient location though. We wouldn't stay again.,-1,1,0.55
303004966,"I spend one night in this hotel, solo in a single room closed to the reception desk.first the receptionist was a bit intrusive and called me in my room, asking my number. he should stay professional and that's enough.then the room is tiny, impossible to breath because with a strange humid smell.  the AC didn't work. the internet is poor, only for one device and you need to re-log every 10 min â¦ !!!this night, it started to rain and then impossible to closed an eye! such a noise on the room that i tough the water would came in. I looked for someone at the desk and there was nobody, the door for outside were looked ! this is totally crasy. the worst hotel in my life, nightmare!",-1,6,0.526507937
271304544,"I stayed in this hotel for one night for a weekend trip to Pisa. I was traveling alone and I would not recommend this hotel to any woman traveling alone. During the check-in the (male) receptionist asked me very inappropriate questions such as if I am married, if I like to go dancing and to drink beer and in the end also if I liked violent men which I found very disturbing. Needless to say, I was terrified and did not sleep very well that night. Apart from being disrespected by the receptionist, the window did not open, there where holes in the sheets and it was very noisy at night. In addition the Wi-Fi did not work.Don't sleep here unless you really have to.",-1,0,0.520833333
230088333,"The location of the hotel is excellent as it is located directly opposite Pisa's central train station.However,I found the staff were particularly unhelpful and rather ponderous.In addition,the breakfast provided was bland and very basic.I would definitely not stay there again.",-1,0,0.45952381
36867272,"No elevator, we did not get any help to carry our heavy bags upstairs. We did not get advice from the reception of how to use the lights in the room and we asked the cleaner who was helpful. The staff at the reception did not smile or talk much. The lady though gave us advise how to go the tourist information center and recommended a bus than a train to go to Viareggio because of a train accident.The breakfast was okey with also cheese and ham. There was a TV in the breakfast room.The colours in the hotel were terrible orange, green.. The room was small. There was no noise of traffic to our room, so we could sleep quite well. The bathroom was terrible. When it got wet, the smell was awful... There is mould.Location is close to railway station. There is an afro-asian shop in the same street but also an elegant wine shop. I do not know if the area is safe late at night. It was easy to reach the hotel when we came from Florence by train. We also took a train to the Pisa airport when leaving. There were only three passengers in the morning. We did not see any taxis at the taxi station.We walked to the Pisa tower, but there are also buses. In tourist information they guided us a nice way to walk there. There is not a long way to a shopping street from the hotel and there were also some restaurants some steps away.From a bus station we bought tickets to Viareggio beach resort. The bus stop was not far from our hotel. The buses were full of beach vendors when we came back and the bus was very hot. So, do not wait until the last bus. Luckily the driver opened the door while driving.",-1,0,0.579513889
61336933,"We arrived very late to Pisa Central Train Sta. and were immediately concerned with the safety of the area around the station.  The hotel is a stones'-throw from the station and we never really felt good about our choice (booked online).  The room was plenty large enough for us and we toughed-out the night.  We changed hotels the second night and were much happier.  You get what you pay for, and at the Roseto that means thin walls, stained bedspread (with a patch sewn in for good measure), a strange odor and really odd towels.  I must admit that the hotel and area looked much better in daylight, but it just wasn't for us.",-1,0,0.408351648
164070839,"Stayed there for one night and this is not our first visit so we were very disappointed when we received a sub standard room (104) this room had obviously not been renovated - though the hotel advertises safes in every room there was none in this room and the rooms you see on the web are not like this. Very old TV - air con unit falling to bits, carpet and deco shabby, bathroom needing up graded.. there was dust under the mini bar  in the room looks like not been touched for ages.. We have stayed here before and had the renovated rooms which are really lovely and did not realise that some rooms still required to be upgraded so would think twice about staying again.  Just a shame.. there is also no bar area in the hotel where you can have a drink before going out for dinner or on your return..",-1,0,0.469722222
603392325,"This is NOT 4 star hotel. It's a 2 star hotel. Rooms with broken glasses, closet doors with holes, dirty walls, bathrooms from the 80s, dirty carpets. It's a shame for NH hotels. See the pictures attached.",-1,0,0.666666667
600954721,"Staffs extremely rude. I went to Pisa on a work trip and closed the hotel on an internet site. I stayed two weeks in a row. In the first I made the payment at the hotel and got the receipt as necessary, the second weekend the payment was also made at the hotel, but the staff refused to give me a receipt, being extremely rude because I had closed on a website. But payment was made at the hotel, so it is the responsibility of the hotel to give the receipt, as was done the previous week. I wrote to the hotel several times, after contacting the website and confirming the hotel's obligation to provide me with the receipt and I did not have any answers. Also, the room is very small and nothing comfortable. Sorry for this atitute. Never again am I in one of NH!",-1,1,0.435
560798505,"Myself and my colleagues stayed in this Hotel for 5 nights. The hotel was very clean and the staff helpful. Unfortunately this hotel had no hot water for at least two the mornings we stayed, when we complained no one seemed bothered about this at all. The rooms were a bit on the cold side. The breakfast was pretty poor, food was ok but there was no cutlery on a few occasions and we had to ask for a tea cup most mornings. Tables were never cleared and very dirty. I don't think we will be staying at this hotel again when we plan our next trip to Pisa",-1,0,0.62
425257157,"This hotel is substandard in its services. The manager who was in charge in evening is reckless and unaccountable. The hotel has very poor wifi which is mentioned in many reviews.I want to make sure people read this review and stay away from this hotel for their own good.The water that that runs in the tub or even sink is muddy and brown in color. When I complained about the water or even the wifi the manger was reluctant to do anything.His attitude was &quot; I dont care&quot; and &quot; I cant do anything&quot;. On top of that the manger said wifi is a privilege. Seriously which world are you living in? The NH group has no where you can give a feedback about its service which shows how little they care about customers.FOr the amount you pay and the so called 4 start rating, this is a messy place.",-1,1,0.603950617
178466671,"This hotel was booked because it was convenient for the railway station. Unfortunately its proximity to the railway station meant it was also adjacent to the bus station - not aware of railway sounds but noise from buses sitting below our window was intolerable for almost the entire night. This was compounded by noisy inefficient so-called air conditioning - so window closed and no cooling air in the room. We require and book twin rooms. This room had two separate beds but they were separated only by the thickness of a bed sheet. This does not constitute a twin. Beds not comfortable, this especially noticeable because no-one was going to sleep in this room. Service from reception staff was okay for a one night stay but it was nothing more than polite efficiency - disinterested staff.Breakfast suited me because there was greasy bacon to be had along with the usual fare.",-1,0,0.6025
117806459,"When we arrived the modern decor was promising and the concierge was initially helpful... to a point where he then stopped being interested! We were quite early and they found us a room which was a nice thing to do except that it was a hideous, tiny, dated, smelly dungeon of a thing with a delightful view of the hotel's massive air-conditioning system. It was stuffy too bc in spite of having a full view of the internal workings of the hotel's heating and cooling, our aircon was about as powerful as my great grandma's breath. The bathroom was functional, just, but mouldy and gross in he base of the shower, furthermore there was a weird, rather cool stash of bathroom goodies in tangerine and lime that looked like it belonged in a hotel that cared. The bed was potentially comfy had I had it to myself, but even though I'd requested a twin room bc traveling with my 8 y/o, we got a double that was really closer to a king single so we spent the night kicking each other.  Breaky was good I thought except devastatingly included only that disgusting percolated coffee from a 'stay hot' thingie and no real coffee...this is an absolute sin in Italy and cause alone for never going back. It was insanely easy to reach from the station and equally easy to access the airport via 5minutely buses from the front door but they were the highlights....for gods sake don't go there for a romantic getaway!",-1,2,0.581057423

226033774,"I stayed there for one night with my family. We booked two rooms, one of them with twin beds. At the arrival, there was no possibility of twin beds. Ok, they offered us a suite for four people instead which was indeed a loft with a living room in the lower floor and two beds with two complete bathrooms in the upper floor accesible through a spiral staircase. It sounded perfect. When we get into the room, the airconditioning didn&#39;t work. The upper floor of this lovely loft-suite does not have any window to the street, so no fresh air.

547559146,"We have stayed in several NH Hotels previously and this hotel is extremely disappointing. The room is ok - it is a standard room and the bathroom is a bit tired and grubby. There are some water marks on the ceiling and walls leaks from the upper floors. No tea making facilities. Location is fantastic though as it is very close to the station and city centre. But, most disappointing is the disengaged attitude from the reception staff and lack of bar/24 hour facilities. There is a vending area in reception which has very little stock: no cups for coffee (and despite requests these were not replenished), no fresh fruit etc.  We have ALWAYS enjoyed our stays in NH Hotels but not this time.",-1,1,0.451190476
547184204,"I booked a non-smoking, &quot;superior room&quot; but there was absolutely nothing superior about it - have a look at my photos. When I entered the room, it was stinking of cigarettes so I returned to the reception to ask for a different one. I was told by one of the employees that &quot;it was a non-smoking room but maybe people smoke in it&quot; (???) - the most ridiculous explanation I'd ever heard in my life. He wasn't really interested in solving my problem so I just had to return to my room and keep the windows opened for some time. I don't smoke so sleeping in such a stinking room was VERY unpleasant for me. I found numerous cigarette marks in the room (see my photos) so obviously it was a smoking room and the way the receptionist lied to me was just unprofessional and simply rude. The &quot;superior&quot; bedding turned out to be an ugly black blanket &amp; a white sheet - neither comfortable nor very hygienic. The &quot;superior&quot; shower didn't work. The staff in charge of the breakfast were very welcoming and really seemed to care but the breakfast itself was rather poor - a few slices of ham and cheese, some scrambled eggs, milk, yoghourt, croissants and that's mainly it. It doesn't sound very bad but it's supposed to be a 4-star hotel so I was expecting much more. In a nutshell, I can't imagine why this hotel has 4 stars and, mind, my experience is based on a stay in a &quot;superior&quot; room, I can't even imagine what the standard rooms look like. I don't recommend this hotel to anyone, unless you like to be ripped off.",-1,3,0.533333333
141447096,"... having driven for 6 hours across Italy, having stayed in various styles and grades of accommodation, the greeting received at this hotel by the male receptionist was in a class of its own. I entered the building smiling, tired, and not looking my best it has to be said, and he just looked at me in the most disinterested and dismissive manner, and when I asked him where the car parking facilities were it was almost too much for him to answer in an audible and polite manner. Undeterred at this stage I returned to the car and duly found the garage, where the most helpful and jovial young man aided and assisted us to park.  This turned out to be an unusual moment in the service this hotel offers. Upon returning to reception my partner and I found the same man, watched by his female colleague who appeared not to speak any English,  and were subjected to his staring at the computer for some length of time, only to be given a room that would not enable anyone to enter with any luggage due its constricting size, one pillow on the bed, and, a shower that was a positive health hazard. For this they were asking the princely sum of 109 euros.

Amazingly this had a bed big enough to sleep two people, toiletries, a bath and air conditioning.  How could this not have been offered in the first instance? I can not bear to be reminded further of this place or the rudeness of the reception staff and will therefore end by saying that the food offered at breakfast bordered on the worst I had eaten anywhere in Italy, and the service appalling. However, on collection of the car the service was first class ... for the sum of 19 euros it was almost worth it for the civility.

475223829,"This hotel is reasonable in many ways: the people are polite and helpful; it is conveniently placed by the station; the walk to the cathedral passes through the lovely centre of the city.However, the air-conditioning was not working when I stayed there, and the room was stifling.  Two representations to the hotel staff, and a visit from an engineer, failed to make any difference.  There were some unconvincing excuses about the changeability of the weather. I had to sleep with the windows wide open to be able to get any sleep at all.  They should be able to do better than this.",-1,1,0.533333333
18759838,"We had failed to book a hotel in advance for our one night in Pisa. My wife walked into the reception with our six year old and enquired to the price of a room for a family of four. She was quoted 280 euros for the one night.  Somewhat taken aback I walked in a while later and took a brochure from the stand. I called the hotel booking line and was offered a family room for 85 euros! (including breakfast) However the hotel was barely worth the price we paid! They have glossed up the reception and dining space but our room interior had been unchanged since the early 1980's.  It had a strong smell of tobacco smoke. Just like the old days!  Everything was well past it's sell-by-date. The writing desk was falling apart. The room had not had a deep clean for a very long time, if ever.  The television was &quot;Antiques Road Show&quot; quality.It is not a four star hotel in my opinion.  Isn't a porter supposed to take your bags at reception on arrival at a four star? ( we had a few heavy suitcases) It seems low on staff numbers. The receptionist and all of the staff seemed remote and disinterested. Breakfast just about OK. But there was no warm welcome as we arrived in the dining room.  Sorry,  but I think that's important.Plan your escape route in an emergency as the central fire escape staircase has no fire-check doors on each floor. It would form an excellent smoke distribution system in the event of a fire and would not comply with UK Building Regulations.",-1,4,0.431111111

The carpet was dirty and the electrics were dodgy.  The A/C worked but was very noisy The bathroom was recently installed but needed a good clean - especially the toilet.  From looking at the other reviews I can only assume that we had a room which is still to be renovated however we were really disappointed as we had paid 120 Euros.

The bathroom was clean and so was the bed but that is all we could say for it as far as the accommodation goes.  The staff in the reception were not very friendly or helpful and we felt we were a nuisance just by being there.  The breakfast was ok but that is all.  It was buffet style self service which is fair enough but even drinks were in the machine with no decaffeinated coffee.  The choice and quality was not Four star in our opinion.  I asked for a teapot for my tea bag and a pot of boiling water came in a teapot but no lid!!! Also you cannot get an evening meal there and there is no bar.  There are sandwiches in a machine and cold drinks.  The up side to this hotel is it is very close to railway station.  You can take a train ride to Lucca which is about thirty mins away.  It is also in the town and an easy walk away from the leaning tower.  Pisa is a beautiful place but we were disappointed in this hotel.  The walls are thin and the floor was laminate so we could hear people walking in their rooms.  The tv from the room next to us was noisy.,-1,3,0.613219373

I had to fill it using the shower head because the water control didn't work properly. Tiles in bathroom were noticeably dirty.  I used damp toilet roll and soap to clean a patch, the difference was noticeable.  The fittings were all very worn, very little chrome left.  Wallpaper in bathroom damaged in two places. Next morning we  asked  housekeeper to come to room to see problems, she apologised.  Filled in form for the hotel manager, left it in Reception, didn't get any response.

213993754,"I stayed at NH Cavalieri following a recommendation from the coordinator of the group I was meeting.  I was only there one night and I am not sure I would stay there again.  The hotel is very fairly well located as it is across from the train station.  It is about a 20-minute walk from the central historic area and the tower - I had to walk it.  If you want to go to the tower you can get a bus in front of the hotel but make sure you have the 2-euro or a ticket as they won't take you otherwise.  The hotel was fairly modern and relatively clean.  I did see a hair on the floor in the bathroom which is always a red flag.  However I did not see anything else out of place.  As I was there one night and by myself I got their smaller 64 euro room.  It was so small I had to climb over my big suitcase to get to the bathroom.  The room was also on the first floor right next to the elevator which I could hear go up and down.  I am a LIGHT sleeper so I got almost no sleep due to this.  The bed and pillows were also so hard and heavy I could not find a comfortable position to sleep in.  When I first checked in the older gentleman at the front desk was relatively friendly as I tired to speak Italian to him.  However the next day when I needed to change some money and get the right change to get on the bus I got zero help!  I WASTED an hour and a half looking for a place to exchange money near the hotel as they kept telling me to go places that did not exchange money - the two Western Unions, three banks and the Chinese shop they referred me to do not exchange money.  They should have known this instead of wasting my time and other people I ran into with the same exact issue.  Two lovely English ladies got the same run around.  I could have spent my time much more wisely.  Advice - go to the tower and there is a really nice shop there that exchanges money.  What really annoyed me and tempts me to give them a 1 on customer service was the fact I had to go to the front desk several times to get them to give me the right change so I could get the bus to the tower.  I never got the right change and had to walk 20 minutes on a hot day!!! I am a walker but have a bad knee so the walk on a hot day was annoying!!!  I waited for three different buses - they come about every 15 minutes and never could take the bus as the hotel REFUSED to give me the right change.  I needed a 2-euro coin and they finally gave me change with a 5-euro bill after asking three different times.  They should have known I needed a 2-euro coin.  I was able to come up with the change to get a ride back but I cannot tell you how uncomfortable my knee was after the hike!  Several people complained about the front desk service while I was there.  The younger man tried to be helpful but the older balding man had a real attitude.

They told me that they did not have available rooms on that date!They lied to me in the face, since all hotel sites including Expedia.no showed that they had rooms available. They simply did not want to help, they wanted to put the money in their pocket, they do not think on the well-being of guests...shame on you!!!!!

Only to find 4 days later the 3 nights had been charged on my credit card.I tried numerous times to make contact with Hotel Cavalieri to no avail, not one of my emails or phone calls were returned no responds to my querying why I had been charged when I was assured I would not.  I also made contact with NH Hotels international office who also could not be bothered to respond to my question.It was a fair and simple question, one that could have been answered but was not.

Its a 20 minute walk to the Leaning Tower from the hotel.We stayed on the third floor and the wifi was useless.......which was disappointing. We asked at reception and they confirmed it should work all over the hotel. Our room was in need of an update - we had a shower curtain in the bathroom and it looked like the bathroom was out of the 50s! The rooms are also not very well sound proofed - we heard quite a lot from the rooms nearby including a very amorous couple!

576375889,"Probably what I would expect from a 1 or 2 star hotel.Stayed for 1 night on 21 April and whilst not great, it was acceptable for an overnight stay.  Came back a week later and stay was awful. First stay was in a contemporary room (apparently an upgrade I was told on our second visit), second stay was in a classic room - read not updated for perhaps 30 years. Just awful. Peeling paint on the ceiling in bathroom, stained and faded carpet, damaged furniture and fixtures, stained chair, shower curtain not a screen, one bedside light not working, the other lights made an alarming noise when switched on and bathroom floor tiles looked dirty because the grout was black and the tiles chipped.We were horrified when we saw the classic room and asked to move. We were then given a key to a room with a double bed (as originally requested) and that was just as bad as the first and actually had a third bed which blocked the mini bar and took up most of the floor space. We were told there was no option for an upgrade since the rooms were all occupied. We had asked for a quiet room too - but we got probably one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel given the poor glazing and being on the first floor on a corner with loads of traffic and people just below the window. We were going to move to a different hotel but given it was nearly 8pm and we were travelling home the next day we decided to put up with the room. It was a most unpleasant last night after what was otherwise a lovely holiday.Pros - near to station. Not a reason to stay at the hotel. Easy to do Pisa as a day trip from Florence and that would be my recomendation. It's only 5 minutes on the Pisa mover from the airport to the central station and then less than an hour by train to Florence (â¬8.40 one way). Trains are frequent. Cons - Noisy - supposedly sound proofed. In the first room we heard the television from next door and anything that moved in the corridor - there are gaps under the doors. Second room - street noise, crying baby from room across the corridor, staff banging around in corridor, constant banging of doors.Horrible decor in the classic room - old, outdated, grubby. Ancient tiny TV. No tea and coffee facilities although these were provided when we asked.Grubby - both rooms had black mould in the bathroom. Unfriendly and not in the least welcoming. On arrival at the desk I said &quot;hello we are checking in for one night&quot;. I was greeted with no smile and the receptionist just  barked &quot;passports&quot; at me. No recognition we had stayed there just 6 days ago.No bar, no room service, no restaurant (other than for breakfast). Some kind of vending area with tired looking sandwiches was the only place to get refreshments in the hotel.Near to station also means not a nice area. Didn't feel particularly safe, especially given the lack of visible staff at the hotel. After around 5.30pm there was only one person on the frontdesk.Poor maintenance - kettle didn't work in first room because one of the pins from the plug had broken off and was lodged in the socket. One of the two bedside lights not working in second room. Handle missing from wardrobe door in second room.  Pillows were like sandbags - really uncomfortable.I cannot understand how this hotel has a four star rating. The classic rooms are in need of serious refurbishment, there are no real facilities in the hotel and the service is very poor. There is no concierge or anyone to help with bags. Breakfast was passable but nothing to get excited about.  All self service. This was the first time we had stayed at an NH hotel and it will certainly be our last.

The first attempt received no response, while the second generated a brief answer in Italian saying they would do their best to accommodate my wishes.

79312043,"NH Cavalieri Pisa, Italy4 nights stay in August The website sell : The hotel is a modern building with 6 floors, including the ground floor. It consists of 100 rooms as well as 3 meeting rooms with a capacity to seat 80 people. It is situated in the heart of the city, only a short walk away from the central train station and 1km away from the airport. It has an ideal location to reach the central offices, the university and the best shops as well as the splendid monuments (the famous Torre Pendente, etc). The restaurant offers delicious local and international specialities.It doesn't say on this hotels website that the rooms you may get  are run down, old rooms that are manky, dusty and after reading the online description and looking at the photos portrayed and what we got are completely different. This is my first ever stay at a NH hotel property and while I wonât be going back to Pisa Iâm not sure I would be brave again at parting with cash to stay at another NH hotel â what would change my mind?On arrival we were allocated rooms 105 &amp; 106. These were very old, dated, marked, dusty and musty smelling rooms. They stank of smoke despite asking for non smoking rooms.Room 105 â The air con wasnât working so after going back down to reception employee Marko came up and listened to it â saying itâs OK â well no itâs not OK, as it wasnât on. It eventually kicked in but rather weak air con.The room was dusty, and furnishings dated and had black scrape marks on all desktops, the toilet had a temperamental flush â worked fine then it didnât and the tank sounded like it was constantly filling up. Grout on the tiles had black furry mould and the shower head had dirt on it.The net curtains were yellow tinged and had several tears in them. Carpet had a huge stain on it just outside the rooms.Room 106 was rejected straight away as the bed had several brown stains on the sheets along with previous guests black hair! YUK!!! The sink also had hair still in it. When I went down to complain I was ignored for a few minutes by the male employee who was texting on his mobile, he claimed he didnât speak English despite just speaking to one of our party earlier in perfect English â I was then told Marko would be up to see it â still no apology!Marko came up and looked and went away â he didnât seem surprised at the stains â maybe a regular complaint?We asked for both rooms to be moved but only one room was reallocated as they claimed to be full. We were then moved to another old room â apparently non smoking but it stank of stale smoke. Room 309 was not much better but at least it had clean sheets. The remote was covered in dust. Lots of scrapes on all desktops, dirty air con which rattled all night. Bathroom had smelly shower curtain, grout was dirty and in need or work on it. The in room chair had stains on it â all giving a very unclean feel and look. Staff seemed like they didnât care and this showed with the lack of apology after giving us a bed with stains in it! 4* hotel? Youâre having a laugh.We did see into the newer rooms which do look a huge improvement but if youâre stuck in an old room then this will spoil your stay as well as the staff and their donât care attitude. These complaints were all made there and then but got us nothing but the feeling we were causing a nuisance. When I rang for an iron and board as remember itâs a 4* hotel. I was given the option of having one brought to my room or to have someone do it for me. I asked for it to be brought to my room please. I was then called back to say there wasnât any iron or board that could be brought to my room as the hotel didnât have any â but I could be shown to a room and a member of staff would stay with me till I did the ironing â how odd!BreakfastA basic selection of 2 types of cereal, 4 types of fruit cut up, small selection of hot food (bacon and scrambled egg) Hard boiled eggs, some cold tomatoes, breads and some cakes. Orange juice, tea and coffee â all self service. Kept well stocked â can only hope their hygiene levels are better then housekeeping.The locationThe hotel is ideally located opposite the central train station with easy and regular connections to Florence and the Cinque Terre â 5 Euroâs 80 each way.   Be aware of pickpockets at the train station â have money out ready so you donât have to go into your purse/wallet at the station. Machines are in several languages and will give change â you need to validate your ticket prior to travel â can be done at the same machine of purchase if travelling soon.Itâs also about a 25-30 minute walk to the leaning tower â all in all Pisa doesnât actually have much and feels run down in places. Use it as a base with the easy train connections or just a Â½ day visit would do if you have your own transport.Can be a bit more rough looking at night due to the amount of men hanging around in groups, never caused us any issues but just be aware they could be up to no good.The airport is very close and a local train goes there â only takes 8 mins and is only a few euros each â this drops you off right at the terminal building.Roundup â While the outside of the hotel and public areas are all nice looking with the poor rooms allocated could have been put up with the severe lack of cleanliness with the rooms and especially the beds - Stains on my bed sheets is disgusting â still no apology. As long as they got my cash they didnât care. Staff are very dismissive and looked bored with the complaints. Lack of facilities at the hotel and no iron â DO NOT EXPECT a 4* more a 2* for the old yucky rooms. The upgraded part of the hotel looks much better but again will it mean better housekeeping? I doubt that. Complaints were made at the time but they certainly didnât go out their way to make up for issues - stains etc  Photos of the roomâs issues attached.",-1,12,0.44837299

My partner was told to return and stay in our room and it was a false alarm.  It kept going on and off for ages and I was increasingly uncomfortable at what we should do if it were a REAL alarm.

After some time, we were all sent back to our rooms and told to stay there if the alarm went off again.All in all they ended up ruining my birthday.  There was no apology at all at check out.  When I contacted them on my return to give them the opportunity to make it up to me, they said they'd give me a discount on a future stay (but that discount wouldn't be possible to use with any other offer.)To say I'm annoyed at that response is putting it mildly.  I have no intention of ever staying at an NH hotel in my life again.  Poor service is one thing but putting guests at risk is unacceptable.",-1,2,0.470695971
11646176,"This b&amp;b was our last stop of a short autumnal trip in Tuscany and it was a complete disappointment.It is very near to the airport but the surroundings are not very nice and quite far from the city center.Bedroom and bathroom were quite simple and not accurate as regards furniture or decor, but acceptable for a b&amp;b; the breakfast was nice.The real problems were with the owner, Mrs. Claudia: - she refused to give us the key of the door between our corridor (bathroom and bedroom were separated) and the rest of the house;- we had to request towels for two (at first she gave us towels just for one person) and the new towels were humid:- we found our room quite cold (everywhere in our trip in Tuscany the rooms were already heated when we arrived);- Mrs Claudia was very irritated because we (gently) requested the key and the towels and became very very rude, almost insulting us and telling us that we wanted too much for a b&amp;b.I have to point out that we spend our holidays in b&amp;bs, inns and home-runned properties very often, so we perfectly know what to expect from that sort of accomodation....All in all we will NEVER suggest this accomodation to our friends or relatives.",-1,2,0.595916782
79690967,Just returned from my trip to Paris and Italy. We booked the b&amp;b Claudia Ferri back serveral months ago and had confirmation for 1 night for 2 double rooms. I was traveling with my sister and her husband also.When Ms Claudia picked us up at the airport she said our reservation was for 2 nights for only 1 room. Ok now I don't have a room to sleep in. She offers to find me another room at a different location. We were leaving the next morning early and really didnt want to be separated.She offers me a small room that was accually her bedroom. We get in the room and it has a bunk bed in it. My husband say's I'll sleep on the top bunk.NOT. The slates on the bed were bowing down. My hubby says I can't sleep there I will crush you by morning so he gets in the bottom bunk with me.  Needless to say neither of us slept all night.Ms Claudia also says she has to get up to go by fresh bread in the morning so we could not have breakfast until 7:30. We go to breakfast and no bread just a cake she baked and coffee. Reviews said fantastic breakfast NOT!!!.What I think happened was she had a family to booked for a longer stay so she gave my room away.  Then she had the nerve to charge me full price. Oh yes the reviews said she had a great personality. She scammed us as far as I am concerned. I would never stay there again!!!,-1,7,0.446783626

No one spoke English at the Hotel which made things very difficult, it was also slightly annoying that they kept saying phrases to me in Italian over and over again getting progressively louder thinking that somehow i would understand if they just said it louder.  The hotel was awful, no AC, very loud, had a weird smell to it.  The shower was also clogged so you had to take a military style shower (water go get wet, water off sud up, water on rinse, water off shampoo, etc.).  The worst part about this hotel was the angry Italian women that owned the place.  I had a long day of travel and when my room was finally ready i decided i could take an afternoon nap to revive myself, i was awoken by the owner telling down the hallway.  For over 30 mins this women was yelling about something, I finally got up and went for a walk.  The next day my mother arrived in Pisa and when we were leaving to visit the tower the women was yelling down the hallway again (i think at her husband).  Since there was no AC we had to leave the windows open and since you're on a busy street with a bar underneath you it was very loud and hard to sleep.  I would not recommend this to anyone.  The price was cheap but not worth the yelling Italian women, bad smell, or clogged shower.",-1,0,0.524503968

It was extremely hot and loud since the window faced the road. I had to choose to either close the window and suffocate or leave open and listen to sirens and loud mopeds.Then the towels were not towels but cloth, but when I asked to get the proper once the owner gave them with surprised face.Next thing I was trying to take a shower and miserably failed as the tub drain was blocked and water level started raising. There was some dirt and hair floating as I guess the tube was not cleaned before our check in. The owner started explaining that &quot;the guy&quot; will come to fix it next day. I explained that it was already midnight and I needed shower and didn't want to wait till next day for the guy to come and fix it. The owner then said that it must have been previous guest who has done it which confirmed my suspicion that the bathroom wasn't cleaned after last check out otherwise they would have noticed the problem when cleaning the tub. I have also noticed hair on the floor and around the sink. There was plenty of time to clean the place, we only arrived around 11 p.m. ... The owner then disappeared for half an hour and came back with the tool to fix the drain which took him another 20 mins or so... So it was past the midnight before we were able to take a shower at still not cleaned bathroom. The night was very hot and noisy. The only mean of temperature control was open window and floor fan which did not help at all.It seamed to me the owner didn't give a [--] at all. They simply rent out their private rooms (there is only one bathroom for the whole house including owners btw). And I must say the prices were not cheap either, you can easily find something better for this money in Pisa. Otherwise it worth paying extra 5 euros for better service.I do not recommend staying in this B&amp;B.

I did not want to argue about E2.50 though so thought I will just let go but it made me think I should have my eyes open. Our flight was late so I texted Simon and he confirmed it was still ok. When we arrived he was not there, called him, he was asleep and said he will be there in 7 min but we waited 20 at 1.30 AM at the airport in Pisa. We have paid whatever we had to pay next morning with cash and luckily kept the receipt! We did not spend much time in a hotel so can't say much about it, seemed clean, old but clean and well equipped.

My husband went to the office to clear it up and he was told by Simon that he could not find our payment in his computer that is why he took the money again!!!! While we were still in a hotel and all he had to do is ask! He cancelled the payment but obviously our money are pending for 3-5 working days in a bank because that is the procedure they have in this situation. For bank 3-5 working days is obviously a week so right now we don't have money to pay our bills.... but this is not the worst that could have happened, we could have been charged massive fee for going on overdraft if we wouldn't have money on the account or worst, those could have been money for the rest of our stay and return ticket home!!! Complete lack of imagination from their end! I've emiled Simon yesterday and sad thing is he doesn't feel it is his fault, he thinks it's our banks fault (????!!!) he was quite rude as well. We did not even hear the word &quot;sorry&quot; once!!! He seems to think that if he did not got those money in his hands it's not his fault.

As we were arriving by train, we were looking for somewhere that was close to the train station and was a fair mix of ok standard and ok price.  As it is approx 100m from the train station and cost â¬80 for the night, it delivered on those two criteria.In line with other comments, the rooms themselves are just about acceptable in terms of size and quality; the shower was basic and substandard for a hotel of this class.  The reception and breakfast areas are clearly a class above the quality of the rooms in the hotel.What we found frustrating was breakfast finishing at 9.30am - breakfast times were not mentioned when we checked in and we turned up at 9.45am to be told that breakfast time was over.  In a touristy city like Pisa, we were surprised that breakfast finished so early without being warned in advanceIn short - if you get a cheap price, dont have high expectations and are only interested in somewhere to drop your bags before going out to explore for one day, then this hotel may be worth considering.  Otherwise look for somewhere elseOn Pisa - I'd agree with others, in that the town is a fairly standard &quot;old Italian town&quot; with the added twist of a big leaning tower.

Which I did, by pulling on the old strap that protruded from the wall for that very purpose. The blind was raised and I opened the window. Wonderful! However, the blind then refused to go back down. I think that this is because the mechanism that controls it is about 25 years old and not well maintained. We didn't much fancy sleeping with the shutters open and light streaming in theough the gauze-like curtains, so we mentioned this to the staff on our way out that day. We arrived back later to be told by another member of staff that 'you broke it, so you have to leave it open'. Had I swing on the strap, Tarzan-like in my excitement to get the shutters open I might have understood this. But I don't have superhuman strength, nor am I the type to get overexcited by operating a steel shutter. I opened it in the obvious way. It got stuck because it's old and rubbish. But as far as the staff were concerned, this meant that I should have to wake up with the sunrise. Which is early. They did not care.

The trains will shake you out of bed, so no need for an alarm clock!!If you want to ruin your holiday and your opinion of italy and its people, do not stay here.

8399568,"Stayed here for one night only. me, my wife and my three teenaged children. First the good stuff: it's got a nice, clean reception area and the check in was dealt with very efficiently. It is about one minute walk from the train station and about five minutes by taxi from the airpoirt. The beds were comfortable. The bad stuff: the bathroom had that unshiftable smell of rotten drains that you are ocassionally hit with in city streets in high summer, the hotel is in a really run-down and seedy area, every time I stepped out I felt under threat (Pisa generally is a fairly grim and badly maintained city but this is the worst of the areas I have seen - it's that bad), the bedrooms (all three) were tiny and despite us booking three non-smoking rooms, the room my two daughters were in was a smoking room which they wouldn't change for us - it smelled appallingly bad. I'd have to say therefore that it is hideously over-priced and I would only stay there if you were desperate. One night was more than enough. One other thing - the restaurant facilities are vitually non-existant as far as I could tell, and you had to pre-arrange any food you wanted to eat in the evening. So don't rely on it giving you anything like a decent feed.",-1,2,0.681811594

There was no operable air conditioniong and the room was gloomy and dark with a blank wall for a view. There are no parking facilities. But perhaps the most telling thing was when I asked for a First Aid kit as my partner has fallen in the very dark streets around the Hotel and grazed a hand and wrist - none was available despite the receptionist delving through bins and drawers etc. eventually some dubious looking bottle of disinfectant was found. An additional point - the lift can only accomodate two people with luggage in extreme difficulty so be prepared for a considerable wait, (there are six floors).

I wish we would have stayed near the river and shopping district, and walked over to the tower.  It was very noisy, with a lot of foot traffic and very aggressive street vendors, and our room was just one floor off the ground floor so it made it unbearable.  If you are driving a car to Pisa, stay somewhere else.  The location is restricted against vehicles, so you cannot access it with a vehicle.  You have to pay an attendant at an independent parking lot to park overnight, about 30 euros, and a lot of walking with bags.  The room smelled of disinfectant which did not dissipate, even with open windows.  It was very warm, but we understood that in April, hotels in Italy do not turn on the A/C.  However, every other hotel we stayed at offered us a fan.  Not here - no fans, and the recommendation was a flat &quot;open the windows&quot;, which was unpleasant because of the loud pedestrian noise.

There were some good points and bad points, but I reckon the bad outweighs the good! Booked it because it was not too expensive and the location was good, so didn't expect much but have stayed in better 3 star places! I was due to go alone and my friend decided to join me last minute. I emailed the hotel to request a rollaway bed but received no response. On arrival the reception attendant was very abrupt and rude in general. He denied any knowledge of my email (presumably they don't check it often), initially refusing to put a bed in and demanding we book another room instead. He suddenly changed his mind and agreed to put the bed in for a small fee; we were happy it was sorted out but quite confused at his initial claim it was &quot;impossible&quot; with a sudden change of mind! The room was not the cleanest, with old musty carpet. The bathroom was bigger than the room! Was fine but the tubing of the mounted hairdryer was cracked so it didn't work well at all. Tried to dry my hair whilst holding the tubing shut with my hand and ended up burning my hand. The rollaway bed was uncomfortable and I couldn't sleep much at all that night.The only really good thing about the hotel was the location! Right next to the Piazza de Mercoli. I think the worst part was the persistent rudeness of the staff. But if you want something cheap in a good location for one night only I suppose it will serve it's purpose!",-1,6,0.55454823

Stayed here two nights at the end of an Italian holiday as we wanted to be in close proximity to the station as we had an early flight and we wanted to spend a day visiting Lucca. In terms of location it suited our needs as the station is c.10 mins walk away. It is also close enough to restaurants and sites (although as we'd been to Pisa before we didn't need to be too close to these). The staff on arrival were very pleasant and informed us of a couple of 'minor' sites to take in. Now comes the downside: the room had character but soon became irritating as it was gloomy and a bit musty; the TV seemed to have a mind of its own and the small size of the room was not helped by badly positioned furniture, plenty of bruised shins. Then there was the noise; the B&amp;B is positioned on a main street and has no sound insulation whatsoever, it was if the people on the street (2 floors below) were standing in our room; the first night the noise carried on to 2 am and then recommenced at 4 am with a couple having a robust exchange of views. The second night also carried on until 2 am and recommenced at 5 am with the motorised street cleaner; we were glad there wasn't a third night. We only had one breakfast as we had an early start on our final morning; this was poor with powdered juice and limited choice which became even more limited as there was no attempt to replenish dishes. We were also never informed about the 'afternoon tea' available to guests. There was, additionally, a mix up with our bill; to cut a long story short we were charged twice and on being questioned about this the B&amp;B attempted to deny we'd stayed there, then that we'd paid them.

First, the taxi driver dropped us off at the wrong hotel(one right beside the tower). When we arrived, the receptionist seemed confused at our arrival and was asking us for an email confirmation. She finally figured out that we were at the wrong hotel and she called them for us(apparently the two hotels have very similar names). She told us it was a short walk there and gave us directions. We arrived and a young guy checked us in. He helped us get our luggage up to our room. He was very nice and helpful and told us we could store our luggage there the next day after we checked out of the room. The room itself was a quad room with 4 single beds and that's it besides the small bathroom. We had read about a mosquito problem here and did see some but were never actually bitten in our room. The road noise was horrible!! The room was tiny and the air never worked after asking 2-3 times about it the young guy said he was coming to our room in 5 mins and he never showed but the air mysteriously kicked on after we complained but it never cooled the room down. The next morning after sleeping terrible, we went to eat breakfast and it was very poor and the receptionist (a young lady)was washing dishes right behind the receptionist counter and was very unfriendly. She never once greeted us and she made it clear later that they do not store luggage at their hotel but she would go ahead and do it since we were told they would. The hotel is about a 10 min walk from the Leaning Tower and was located on a very busy, main road with lots of traffic. I would not recommend this hotel because of the room itself and the horrible road noise and the fact the receptionist was very unfriendly.

We asked for a taxi to be ordered for Pisa airport on Saturday night when we arrived, for the next day, Sunday, and were assured this would be done. It was a hair-raising half hour prior to our checkout the next day when we learned that Rita had not done this. More exasperating was that her excuse involved it being a Sunday, and cab drivers were hard to find. There was much rolling of the eyes and melodramatic sighs as we asked her to keep phoning different cab companies to fulfill this undertaking that she had promised to do the night before.

We bought mosquito repellant and cortisone cream from the chemist.The second night she again could not sleep due to being bitten. The next morning she had more bites all over, that came up in huge red marks. Our last night she again could not sleep and the next morning i saw a bug crawling on the bedding.

At no time did she apologise or offer to pay for all the treatment we had bought from the chemist, or compensate us in any way at all.Our holiday was completely spoilt by 3 sleepless nights, my partner being covered in large red bite marks from her face to her toes and intense itching and pain.The fact that there was no apology for inconvenience, expense or distress made us very angry. The owner was more concerned about herself.What could and should have been a lovely few days, was ruined.Ironically, when we arrived, the owner told me that her mother had just stayed in a bad hotel in London and was bitten all over !!If she gets this problem sorted, it would be a great place to stay but we would never stay there again.",-1,2,0.438809524

Then, we went out for dinner and returned around 11:30pm to find the main door locked. We were not given a code to get in and stood outside getting eaten alive by mosquitos for 40 minutes while we rang the bell, called multiple phone numbers and knocked on the doorâall to no avail. We could hear a drunk man shouting in Italian nearby at the empty train station and my wife and I were scared out of our wits. Finally, after much frustration and fear that we would have to find our way to another hotel from the desolate, unsafe, middle-of-nowhere of the hotelâs horrible location, I began kicking the door as hard as I could to get anyone's attention. Thankfully, I accidentally managed to kick the door open, and we got back in. It was a tremendously frightening and unpleasant experience and the receptionist made a horrible mistake in not telling us we would need a code to get in. When I mentioned this the next morning the woman at the desk (who checked us out of the hotel) said, &quot;I only make coffee&quot; and suggested I contact the receptionist later that night, which I did.I was shocked to find that not only did the receptionist not apologize or offer any sort of compensation, she told me I was 'only out there for 5 minutes' despite the fact that I sent her numerous screen shots of my phone calls (that began at 11:34pm and went to 11:50pm) to their hotel and number they left outside. Further, it shouldn't be the guest's responsibility to call the hotel after hours if they are locked out - what if my cellphone had died (it only had 5% left, actually). The receptionist admitted she did not give us the code upon check-in. And yet, she shouted at us that we were only out there for 5 minutes (not true, as verified by my outgoing calls on my phone). It was a shocking lack of customer service.And, last but not least, once we got in I was incredibly disappointed to find one of the least comfortable beds of my life. I could barely sleep.

The host, Alphonso, sounded very nice on the phone and he was waiting for us at a free parking spot where we could park our car. You need to pay for a permit to enter the center of Pisa, but Alphonso arranged it all. So far so good. We had to walk a bit with our luggage and we requested Alphonso to take our lightest carry on bag with wheels. Over his shoulder he told us 'just for the record, this in NOT my job'. Down the drain with all the positive remarks about the helphfulness of this gentleman. How welcome can you feel if this is already too much to ask?? We stayed at Villa Christina in Spoleto and an older lady, Anna Maria, even volunteered to carry up our luggage.We tried to shake it off, but when we arrived in the 'apartment' we were really disappointed. The website shows pictures of the nice spots of the villa, the garden, the conservatory, the rooms and the apartment, but does not show the crappy toilet that makes a horrible noise when you use it. The noise is really frightening. Although the villa is nice and close to the main shopping street, it's a bit creepy. We found a few North Africans dealing drugs just outside our door. When Alphonso recovered from his humiliation that he had to look after our very light bag, he actually became friendly and gave us tips about Pisa. Pisa by the way is a city you should pass by during the day, see the Tower and leave to stay somewhere else. It's full of many, quite agressive North African street salesmen trying to convince you to buy whatever they sell. They are like flies, all over the place. We also did not manage to find a decent restaurant. We walked from one side of town to the other, but did not see anything but tourist traps.Alphonso advertises that there is free WIFI in the rooms, however, what he does not tell, is that he switches it off at 22.00 hrs. at night. And that turned out to be a disaster for us. Complications arose during a straight forward operation that my sister was undergoing in Holland that day, which forced us to return home straight away. However: NO INTERNET ACCESS. Alphonso did not answer the normal phone number and his mobile neither, so we were stuck. We left a voicemail and sent an sms asking for help. No reaction. No possibility to book tickets online. Thanks to Alphonso we came too late and did not see my sister alive. The next day he called us, not even inquiring how my sister was, just worrying about his key and his money, which of course we left in the apartment.

When we asked for an extra towel, we were told we had to pay 2 Euro. They offered to call us a taxi - and charged 1 Euro. This is ridicilous, especially since the taxi never appeared, but I will write about this later.Breakfast was bad. One (!) slice of toast for each of us, accompanied by half a cup of coffee and some orange juice - that was all. When we left the table, we were still hungry, but had to pay 4 Euro per Person. When we told the host that we want to cancel breakfast for the rest of the stay, she insisted on us paying for it - apparently because she had to give the money to the booking company. Thats a lie - I talked to the booking company, there are no commissions or anything like that on meals.The worst part of our stay was the day we left.

Everything is electronically operated, including the curtains and windows. The window does not open far enough. 3. The room smells - again a musty, unclean, dampish sort of smell.4. You will be charged 3 Euros every time you order any food/drink from room service. The room service is not terribly efficient.5. The hotel is a bus ride away from the ciry centre. You are far better off getting a hotel that is centrally located. Buses cost 1.5 Euros pp, taxis around 10 Euros to the city. Pisa is lovely - full of charm and simple character. This hotel was the low point in our holiday. If you want a modern hotel, give this one a miss.",-1,1,0.548214286

I already slept as I woke up and heard a very loud noise, it seems, that there were some workings exactly in front of my room door. I called the reception, but the employee spoke very poor english and promised me that a colleague will call me back.

The gentleman at FrontDesk told my booking with promotion rate was cancelled by some reasons, what I can do was making a new reservation of 2 rooms with walk-in rate!We were shocked by what he told.  Unluckily there's no alternative nearby, we decided to stay a night there.We were arranged to 2 room with inter-connecting door.  The ventilation system at 1 of our rooms were found out of service, so I called the FrontDesk and told about the situation - surprisingly, the gentleman, speaking in a impolite manner, telling me the ventilation system should be in good conditions and that is not a good reason for requestiong a room change!!  I was very angry by that time and asking for source of submitting a complain, he said I can do online, and suggested me to use the connecting computer at lobby which have to pay for access!Hard to believe the customer service level of a 4-star well decorated hotel can be that low.

We asked for a deliverd breakfast but our order did not get taken from the door even though it was left out very early, so breakfast was 45 mins late and undercooked and cold!The air conditioning was not adequate for the size of room and was too hot even after it had been altered to be cooler.  Everything in the mini bar was similarly warm making it a fairly useless facility.The hotel had no orange juice on arrival and they still had none at breakfast - how does a whole hotel run out of juice for 24 hours with no one sorting that out.  I'm afraid their attitude to service was very poor. Even after I made these complaints and asked to borrow 2 towels for the day to go to the beech they wanted to charge 10 euros each!

Although the hotel was clean and the staff were ok, it was basically a really weird place to stay!  The style of the hotel is meant to be modern and futuristic but it just doesn't work.  It has a clinical feel to it and when I was there this was made worse by the fact that there was no one else staying.  The location is not good if you want to visit the leaning tower.  The breakfast is bland and limited and not up to general Italian standards.  There is a strange lighting system in the rooms that I was never able to work out and the lights would randomly switch on and off by themselves in the middle of the night.

Our room was very clean and the breakfast buffet was good.The bad points:It is far from the tower (which is pretty much the only thing to see in Pisa). We had to take taxis which got kind of pricey, and they are also hard to come by in Pisa. You can't just flag them down - you actually call the taxi company - which is difficult if you don't have a cell phone or speak Italian or know how to use their pay phones.The man working the reception desk was snobby and rude. He condescendingly told us we couldn't just &quot;wave our hands&quot; to get a taxi &quot;like they do in New York&quot;.  He also did not offer or even mention that the hotel has complementary shuttle service - which we read later in our info booklet in our room.  Never smiled once.The doors must be made of cardboard because we could hear every sound coming from the hallway as if the people were standing at the foot of our bed. To make it worse, our room was on the end next to the metal door leading into our hallway, which slammed shut each time someone went through it.Lastly, the beds were very hard, not comfy at all.Overall it was okay - I mean, it was very clean - which goes a long way in my book.

Trying to find out room was a challenge but when we did let's just say black walls, floor and ceiling, black and red curtains and white furniture with hidden switches to switch on a few lights. I have never seen such a dark and unwelcoming room in my life. We only stayed one night with one drink at the bar and breakfast which were fine and the Barman was charming.

117131767,"I have to say, I'm amazed that this hotel rates number one in Pisa?! It's ok ... but nothing special.The hotel is situated a long way out of the city, and is in the middle of nowhere! So unless you have a car, or are willing to pay big taxi prices, you've not much to do when you get there.The rooms are clean, but small. The bathrooms are pretty well equipped. Make sure you ask for a quiet room away from the lifts though, as otherwise you could be woken up throughout the night by the noise from the lift.The restaurant is ok. And the bar looks great - especially if the weather's nice, and you can sit in the garden. But because there's not much choice in the area for places to eat or drink, so the prices in both the restaurant and bar are not cheap to say the least! We paid 18 Euros for ONE cheese sandwich and two wines.The hotel has special room rates for hospital visitors (the hospital is just across the road), and for business people. So you can pick up last minute rooms at around 100 - 140 Euros. But be aware that you'll probably end up paying much more than that with the extras you're charged!If you want to use the internet, try to ensure your rate includes internet access. It's not free otherwise, and again, it's NOT cheap.They say that there's a free shuttle bus to the airport - but beware! It only operates in certain hours, and you have to ensure it's not pre-booked. We tried to book it at check-in for the next day, but were told that it wasn't going to be available for us, and that we would have to pay for a taxi instead. 15 Euros extra!The website also states that there's free parking on-site. But when you get there, you have to pay 20 Euros to park in the hotel car park. There is free parking outside the hotel, but if you don't get there early you could miss out as it only has limited spaces.Also, if you're leaving the hotel before 7am, don't bother booking Bed and Breakfast. Even though, when you check-in, they may promise a take-away breakfast will be with you prior to 7am the next morning, they didn't deliver it for us as the kitchen was closed!In short, if you're only using the hotel as a base for the airport, and only there for a few hours, you'll be fine. But if you're wanting a nice hotel, with some atmosphere, and better value for money, there are definitely nicer places to stay in and around Pisa.",-1,8,0.528324515

After an hour of checking in I noticed my bathroom lights were not working (no bulbs).  When i reported this the receptionist had the nerve to ask why I didn't report that morning!  I had to add I had only been there 1 hour.  That isn't  exactly what you would expect when reporting a fault.The rooms are a good size and nice.  The only complaint is if you are going to have floor lilke that please clean them properly or hand out complimentary slipper.  My feet were black each time I stepped out the shower.

They are black, white, and red.  There are mirrors everywhere, one of which hides a very small monitor they call the TV.  There's no place to put your suitcase as in a &quot;normal&quot; hotel that has those racks/stands for your suitcase.I would highly recommend for BUSINESS or for COMFORT, you go somewhere else.

We were not disappointed - the trip took 10 minutes and was 10 euros per room.The hotel was very modern and clean.  We were on the ground floor but it was very quiet and easy to get to the hotel facilities.The restaurant area and gardens are lovely.  However the service offered was extremely disappointing.On arrival we asked to order drinks and sat in the conservatory area.  We asked if it was ok to order drinks and then waited for the very disinterested waiter to return 20 minutes or so later to provide menus and then had a further wait to order drinks.  We took a taxi to the centre of Pisa and was surprised that it only cost 12 euros which seemed reasonable for the distance travelled.We returned to the hotel and booked a table for dinner at 9pm.  We then took a seat in the garden for pre dinner drinks.  We waited another 20 or so minutes for service and eventually had to go and find someone to ask for help.  The waitress came over and we asked for the wine list.  Again she disappeared and when we managed to see her again to ask where the list was she said &quot;there is only one in the restaurant and it is busy so you have to wait&quot;.  Not impressed.  Finally we managed to order wine, but the service was slow and the serving staff looked like they did not want to be there.We then moved to our table for dinner.  Again we waited a long time for menus and to order further drinks.  It was a very slow and disorganised service provided.  The waiting staff seemed to be running around but didn't appear to be doing much.  They were unhelpful and one in particular was extremely rude - his English was fairly good until we wanted to complain when he said he did not understand English and walked off.  The only person that seemed helpful and pleasant to diners was the guy that managed the bar and drinks.  We complained to him about the service and it did improve slightly after that.  Once the food arrived it was lovely and tasty.The hotel are letting themselves down with the service.

So we didn't get off to a great start, and that was before I'd even seen the room or had to endure the restaurant 'service' and produce. The hotel is really trying to be something it's not.  It is completely soulless and tries very hard to be modern and 'cool', but what I would have given for a simple tap, flusher or light switch - it was impossible to perform the most simple task in a straightforward manner.  The 2 course dinner we had was pretentious but largely inedible, and took 3 hours to get through - very disappointing.  The nail in the coffin was the room.  Impossible to find the light switches, so we once we'd turned the room upside down to switch everything off, we found that someone had thought it appropriate to light up the outside of the hotel....... but putting bright lights right outside all the bedroom windows ???????I've never written a poor review on trip advisor before, but this hotel really affronted every sense from the moment we arrived to the moment we left.",-1,8,0.540503848
223508217,"We are a well travelled family of five, used to staying at four star hotels. We booked this hotel based on it's no.1 trip advisor position, four star rating and other reviews. We stayed for one week, using the hotel as a base to explore the region, before moving on to Florence.I simply cannot believe that this hotel is genuinely worthy of four star status. It's location is in the middle of nowhere and there isn't even a mention that it is in the middle of a very run down favela. The rooms, are oppressive with very dark decor. The floor in the bedroom area was not clean and I suspect had not seen a mop and bucket for some time. My children's once white socks were evidence of this fact. The beds are exceptionally hard and uncomfortable. The showers, however,  were good and the bathrooms were cleaned daily, to a high standard. We had fresh towels and bed linen on a daily basis, although I find it rather alarming that there were never any duvet covers on the duvets, merely sheets to cover the duvet and I only hope the duvets themselves were freshly laundered with each new customer??  The housekeeping staff frequently Hoover the corridors at 7.30am, which is great if you need an early morning alarm call but not so great if you intend to lie in. Breakfast was actually quite a pleasure for the first 3 days of our stay. A good selection of fresh juices, fruits, meats, cheeses, pastries and cereals, omelettes made fresh to order and a hot buffet. However, on day 4 of our stay the hotel became much busier and the hotel staff simply could not cope with its influx of guests. Breakfast items were not replenished to meet customer demand. We began having our breakfast earlier, on the assumption that perhaps eating at 9.30 am or so was too late, even though breakfast wasn't due to finish until 10.30 am. But it made no difference. Staffing levels were inadequate and staff just could not cope with the number of guests. Tables were not cleared, with nowhere to sit. Insufficient crockery and cutlery. Restaurant Staff becoming impatient with guests and other members of staff. We, on several occasions witnessed completely unprofessional staff behaviour and conduct including an apparent argument between staff members, complete with throwing of towels and slamming of fists on counter tops. It was somewhat reminiscent of an English sitcom called 'Fawlty Towers'. Do not even consider an evening meal at the restaurant. It is dire. Prices are overinflated and the description of dishes on the menu do not even agree with what you finally receive. There is a very nice,  welcoming trattoria about 2 minutes walk from the hotel, serving, tasty, home cooked meals. We tried to complain about the hotels 'shortcomings'. The reception manager suggested we leave a comment in the front of house book, rather than deal directly with the issues himself. However, he couldn't find the book and so he invited us to leave a review on trip advisor!  I even emailed the hotel directly, during our stay, in an effort to address some issues.  I received a standard, computer generated reply. It's a shame that the management do not want to listen to constructive criticism in order to drive up standards and satisfy the customer.  More staff would be helpful during busy periods. The restaurant staff that we saw worked incredibly long hours, from as early as 7am, until gone midnight.  Staff attitude definitely needs to be addressed. If you do stay here do not expect four star standards.

There were two appalling fake flower arrangements, no tea or coffee, the satellite tv did not have the range of stations promised and the double glazing was ineffectual against the noise from outside.

The problem with this hotel is that it is very outdated &amp; they have not made efforts to correct recurring issues. Myself and my boyfriend had the worst nights sleep here of our whole holiday - the air conditioning unit is far too loud, it sounded as if it was on the verge of exploding. There was another humming noise coming from the bathroom light which we could not find a switch for either. All the light switches are &quot;cleverly&quot; concealed in the headboard of the bed with no labels making it a very frustrating guessing game to attempt to change the lights. There was also a disgusting smell in the bathroom of sewage which stunk out the whole room. After the longest nights sleep I went down to reception early to complain and was told that it wasn't their fault that the air con was so loud and that they knew about the smell and have put air freshener in the rooms when others complain. The receptionist made it seem like my fault because I hadn't got up in the night to tell the night porter about these issues, but there was nothing he could have done!! If they know there is a smell then they should put the air fresheners in EVERY room or fix the plumbing and if the air con units are old they should be replaced. To add insult to injury the eggs and bacon at breakfast were then cold!In my opinion this is not a 4 star hotel, flashy design and free wifi do not make up for basic comforts such as a good nights sleep!

The room was located by a courtyard that was in fact a car park. The noise emanating from the courtyard was severe. But the worst noise that we have ever experienced was from the room next door. We literally heard EVERY sound!! The partition might as well have been paper! It felt like we were in the bathroom with the people next door. Not a pleasant experience.Breakfast was a challenge; the staff was unfriendly, we were not shown to a table, the room was claustrophobic, the choice of dishes was appalling, the coffee was disgusting. The scrambled eggs were a âCuriousâ shade of bright yellow and had an indescribable taste. Needless to say we did not finish our breakfast!As we were departing Pisa later that day, we asked if we could store our luggage at the hotel. We were not given a receipt for our luggage that is highly unprofessional, as anyone could have taken it at any time. We did request a receipt but the hotel staff said there is no need?!On our return to collect the bags, we asked if we could retrieve them and we were merely told, âSIâ and allowed to help ourselves to the luggage.

The paint and decorating finishes need to be updated. The same applies in the tiny en-suite bathroom, where the cracked or damaged tiles had been crudely repaired with silicone filler. It was poorly ventilated,  meaning that bathroom steam and odors spread into the bedroom: unpleasant! The breakfast was very average. A basic buffet-style spread was available but the bread was very ordinary and stale.

I am sure that anyone unlucky enough to have used these rooms must have experienced the same problems so I find difficoult to believe in an innocent misshap by the hotel.

Check-in staff were courteous and helpful. The room (in an annex) was spotless and full of good things.

But this was negatived by a failure to supply the basic function of a hotel - accommodation in which to sleep. We had practically no sleep. As some other reviewers have noted noise can be a problem here. For us the noise was incessant, loud and lasted through the night. A neighbor in an adjoining property decided that this was the time to perform some major building work.

I was told that the couple who shared it with us would be charged â¬15 (again a surcharge) so the hotel charged â¬39 for the five minute journey from the airport to the hotel.  When I suggested that this seemed a little extortionate, the manager shrugged his shoulders and said that this was a perfectly reasonable charge.  After checking out, we wanted to leave our luggage in the hotel until lunchtime and we were charged â¬1 per bag   - we have stayed in hotels all over Europe and have never been charged for leaving luggage before.

141686653,"This is my 56th review and I tend to be very positive in them. BUT I always tell the truth as I see it and I do report problems AND this hotel was DISAPPOINTING. I felt it was trying to tick boxes for star rating rather than provide a service for us, the travelling public. When I travel I want to feel special. I don't want to be shown small print to prove they are delivering precisely what was promised. (especially if they aren't!!!) Italian hotel star rating is complex.So, is it 4*? Well, the bathroom only had a shower (no bath) and was small. Room window was tiny and blocked by shutters, so dark! Bed was hard. Flooring throughout was tiles, even corridors. So, noisy as people trundled cases. Lift was also noisy. So, a poor night's sleep with late-comers and early departures. We arrived too early for our room. (If you can't meet the contracted time, just say you'd like us to arrive at 1.30 and then we, the travelling public, are not inconvenienced! We arrived expecting to shower and change before lunch: No chance!) 4*? No restaurant (But I wouldn't have dined in a hotel anyway)Free Shuttle to airport -but only if you book direct with the hotel -why? Curiously, they feature TripAdvisor strongly in their marketing, but if you book this way you don't qualify for a free shuttle to airport. I don't think this is clear enough on their website - but frequent reposts by the management on this forum do make that point. Not sure you'd want to rely on their airport service anyway: our (limited) observations suggested late departures and fully booked shuttles. AND, at 5 euros per person, could be more expensive than the taxi  costing 13 euros. Breakfast was ok, nothing special. 4*? Not at all. Limited restaurants close by. 20 min walk to the &quot;tower&quot; and to other reasonable quality restaurants. Overall: Pisa is a day trip from other central Tuscan locations. Only 7 euros from Florence by train, say, so do a day trip and save the bother of an overnight stay, even if you're flying in and out of Pisa.

The hotel has wooden or tiled flooring everywhere which, while it looks very nice, does not offer any dampening of noise.

I'm not sure if it was the design of the building but all noises seem to be amplified.The hotel is also in a side street just off the river, I was a woman on my own and did not feel too safe at night.

The hotel was awfully dated and didnt have an apropiate bar but used the breakfast room as a sort of a bar which did not look inviting at all. The rooms were dated and not nice. We booked a room with a bath but on our arrival we were given a room with a shower and had to change rooms the next day after a lot of complaining and hassle. The hotel didnt even have a decent hall-reception area expected of a four stars hotel but a sort of sitting room really dated and small.The reception staff were not friendly at all. I have been in italy quite a few times and always found that reception staff smile at you and say bone jorno or something of the sort everytime but not this lot. We also had neigbourghs  on the next room who played music really loud at 7 oclock in the morning every day and the hotel  did nothing about it.We stayed in this hotel for three nights but tried to spend as much time as possible out of the hotel as it was really not nice.

The location's good - not far from the train station, and a 10-15min walk to the tower.However, the room had a rather musty smell and came with an ash tray. As I'd booked a non-smoking room I queried this with the front desk - they told me that smoking is permitted in all rooms, which is not made clear on the hotel's website, nor third party sites. (The following night another member of staff insisted that, contrary to what I was told earlier, all the hotel's rooms were non-smoking, and that Italian law dictated an ash tray had to be in every room - for 'emergency use'...). Other TripAdvisor reviews also flag that smoking is allowed in all rooms.I also didn't find the room particularly clean, with hairs left in the bathroom. When I mentioned this to staff they did ensure that the bathroom was cleaned properly the subsequent day - but I still found hair on my bedsheets.I found staff generally grumpy, with with the exception of one of the female members of the front desk.I would not recommend this hotel.",-1,0,0.349404762

My room was very very tiny. It looked like a housekeeper's room.  When I opened my suitcase, there was no space to stand anymore. That room was so noisy because the other side was kitchen entrance. My view from the window  was employee's motorcycle. It was very noisy early in  the morning and at night.At night when I went to sleep, I noticed that the bed made terrible noise when I moved. Very bad and poor bed! The worst thing was, whenever someone use the water, I hear terrible noise..water's running. I do not know why, but my room was in the first  floor and if someone lived upstairs use water, the noise always came..many times during that night. So I could not sleep very well and I was very tired in the morning. when I went to have a breakfast, no staff paid attention to me, although it said that 'wait until the staff comes and gives you a table'. I waited maybe more than ten minutes standing in front of breakfast room. I could not wait any longer, so I took a free table and sit down. Breakfast was ok, and location was good, but I would never stay in this hotel again.Also one young man in front desk was very rude. The others were ok.",-1,2,0.565386473
31799995,"I took my mom on a two week trip around Italy as a gift for her 65th birthday. I have been to Italy before and have travelled all over Europe many times. This was the last night of our trip before heading home and I have never encountered such horrible customer service whether I have been in a 1 star hotel or a 4 star. After over 3 hoursof being lied to constantly I actually broke into tears.It was so frustrating dealing with the staff of this hotel and I was supposedly dealing with the manager himself! The hotel made a mistake with our room and tried to put us in their building next door that does not have an elevator. (my mom wears special orthodics and has difficulty with steps). When I made them aware of this I was told if we just wait a &quot;couple&quot; minutes they would put us back into the main hotel. For over 45 minutes they kept telling us &quot;5 more minutes&quot;. We finally got into our room and there was a broken light in the bathroom. Now they wanted us to wait for a service man to take care of this. There were available rooms all around us (housekeeping showed us) and I requested to be moved into one of them so we can just freshen up and be on our way. I was told absolutely not. Now we had a service man in our bathroom as well as the supposed manager. It was after 3:00pm and we were told by &quot;the manager&quot; that he would give us a personally escorted tour of Pisa for all of the inconvenience. He showed us back to the lobby and told us to wait just a moment while he would get the hotel vehicle. After about 10 minutes we asked the reception what was happening. They made a call to him and told us he was bringing the car around. After another 10 minutes they called him again and we were told he was on the way with the car and he would meet us out front. After about 5 more minutes he showed up to the reception and handed me a map claiming he did not know what I was talking about. I have NEVER encountered such arrogance or rudeness in all my years of travelling. From arriving to Pisa at 12:25 it was now after 4:00pm and we hadn't even made it out of the hotel. It was just one lie after another. More than once I was told they would put us in another hotel if we were not comfortable with how they were treating us. When I finally requested they do that I was told I was on my own and they charged my credit card in advance which I did not authorize. I realize mistakes happen, but if they would have just been truthful about everything in the first place we could have left our bags at reception and been on our way to enjoy the last afternoon in Italy. THERE IS NOTHING REDEEMING ABOUT THIS HOTEL.",-1,4,0.471658986

Unclean bathroom littered across the floor with previous guests hairs and unclean sink.2. Check in handed a key told room number - some info, smile etc would have been welcoming and helpful to understand the hotel / breakfast time etc3. Called for iron after long flight all clothes require ironing as we could not go out without - Advised no iron available as 'woman irons and guests must send to her' however she has left 'so nothing we can do'. At this point we requested to borrow / use iron and were advised not possible even after explaining that we had not eaten and required to go out. Asked for the manager - they are not available until the next day so tough!4. Advised about unclean room - again, speak to manager tomorrow - Not helpful for the situation at the time.For those interested in the decor - green wood, chipped with orange furnishings - not particular pleasant, with a high power air freshened of oil placed on bathroom floor, which has over powered the full room.This is not a 4 star hotel, the room, the service or lack of and the cleanliness are problems - Asking also for ratings in trip advisor also interesting - is this how this hotel is no 1! I will write further, but right now stranded in room feeling very unhappy and angry for being duped into staying here.If you are the manager reading this - please feel free to get in touch, as it seems nothing can be done and your guests have to wait for you to turn up!

202090028,"Arrived at the hotel and a very unfriendly receptionist gave us our key and a map, no info on breakfast  times or wifi, we assumed these would be available in the room. There was no-one to help with our bags and when we got to our room there was 3 suit cases already there. Back down to reception and it turned out that the room was originally allocated to another couple but they had requested a change because they did not like the room. We did not blame them, a boring box room that overlooked a small square concrete section that had the constant humming of the kitchen. Sad decoration that could badly do with an uplift and old appliances. If it had not been for the fact that we were only staying 1 night before moving on to Florence we would have changed as well. Then we tried to find the code for the wifi but that was not in the room, used to phone to call reception for this info only to find out the phone did not work, so another trip downstairs. My wife washed her hair, went to use the hair drier and it fell apart in her hands. Later, after we returned from dinner we went into the bar for a nightcap, but there was no staff, then someone did arrive but he could not serve us because he was not the bartender, we would have to wait until she came back, 2 other people arrived, the 4 of us waited. We were just about to give up when the girl finally arrived, a good 10 minute wait!. Went down for breakfast, not sure how many rooms this hotel has but with only 15 or 16 tables, we had to queue and wait to be seated. Breakfast was nice however. Paid our bill to another unfriendly receptionist who literally snatched my card from my hand, without even a thank you let alone a smile. We could not wait to get away. This is not the worse hotel I have stayed in but it is certainly the worse for that sort of money, at over Â£100 for a night this is simply not acceptable.",-1,1,0.550674603
641890268,"I stayed for 1 night in November and as my title says, I really wanted to like this hotel. It is not far from the train station and not far from the Leaning Tower complex. Our room wasn't ready on arrival which I was expecting as we arrived around 12 pm. Daniel I think his name was very nice and helpful.  He showed us where to store our luggage and provided us with a map and some directions. He told us if we needed dinner recommendations to just come back. When we did, he was very nice after we kept going back to ask about other resturants.  The car service to the airport went smoothly and glad I booked directly with the hotel. We also had a balcony. This unfortunately are all the positives I can list. Now to the negatives. We were upgraded to a bigger room with a queen size bed and two twin beds. It was bigger than what I reserved but how could that be a negative right? Well, the room smelled like a sweet cedar smell almost like a moldy smell that they were trying to cover up. The shower stall was extremely small and I am only 5'4 and weigh 115 pounds. My biggest complaint though was the man we encountered back at the reception desk.  We went back to have reception make us a dinner reservation at a local pizzeria after Daniel gave some recommendations. It was our last night in Italy and I wanted to have good pizza. The man at the desk was not the same person who was helping us earlier. When we told him what we wanted, he snickered and in a snotty tone, said the place did not accept reservations. I should have questioned him but thought it was just a pizzeria. Well, he was wrong. When we went there they turned us away saying they were booked for the night. We could not get into any of the other resturants around there. We could only get seated at a place near the train station where the food wasn't that great. This really ruined my last night in Italy. It shouldn't matter on what kind of food we wanted or maybe how cheap it seemed, it was something I wanted. When we got back to the hotel, I badly wanted to give this negative feedback but the man who insisted reservations weren't needed, wasn't there. So thank you for ruining my last meal in Italy.",-1,1,0.482794785

Our room was clean although cramped, with a window with obscure glass opening on the back. the bathroom was a good size with toiletries provided. We chose this hotel partly because of the views advertised. We were very disappointed in the attitude of the staff when we explained we required to leave early for our flight. Although having paid for a Bed and Breakfast they would not provide us with anything to eat for the morning, even stating &quot; you'll be able to buy something at the airport&quot;.  Eventually we were given a cappucino and a postage stamp square of chocolate. Not good enough for a four star hotel! I am quite sure they could have provided us with a pastry, boiled egg, piece of fruit etc, but they had no inclination to do so.

We booked the hotel with hrs (Hotel Reservation Service) for 99 Euro including breakfast. Parking was another 15 Euro we found out later. Breakfast was until 10 a.m., but we did not know.  We showed up 30 minutes later and asked them if we could still have a Cappuccino and a little something. The nice lady in the breakfast room said that breakfast time is over but she will still give us something. So we got a decent cappuccino and a nice croissant and thought that that was very nice of her and left her 2 Euro tip. When we checked out they ask us to pay 10 Euro for the breakfast because we were late. After telling them that this is very bad customer service and discussing about it they still  insisted on the payment. So we ended up paying for 124 Euro for a not so nice place.

Positives - Short 10 minute walk to main tourist area (leaning tower) and nearby the main shopping/cafe area. Negatives - Even more basic than a travelodge in the U.K. It wasn't horrendous but expected way more. Cleanliness lacking. Tiny room with odd smell. Bathroom was very basic. This might be a personal issue but the bathroom towel colours is beige which I really dislike. I always expect and want white towels in hotel bathrooms as extra reassurance they are clean. Maybe I'm just being a bit picky. Either way, it's not a bad stay if you are expecting 1-2 star setting. Breaskfast was ridiculous, chaotic, extremely busy and had to wait 15 minutes to be seated (even though there were empty tables as there was minimals taff to clear up).

We had spent three wonderful nights in a fabulous hotel in Florence where staff were wonderful, attentive and friendly and the accommodation and food were excellent.The Bologna staff were surly, unhelpful and inconsiderate in comparison.  My friend and I booked a twin room and were allocated accommodation which appeared to be a converted garage / outhouse, with a large bedroom, a tiny single bedroom, entrance area and bathroom. We were shown to the room by the male receptionist but were left to negotiate the doors, steps, ups and downs with our luggage by ourselves.  The room was clean but very sparse, had bare walls, tiled floors and was dark given its position at the back of the hotel overlooking the parking area.  On arrival, we simply left our luggage and went to explore Pisa for the day, returning to the room to enjoy a relaxing evening prior to our early start in the morning.  On our arrival, we discovered there was no heating - the room was freezing.  When we complained we were told that the heating for the four areas was provided by one air conditioning unit which no-one appeared to know how to set and which turned itself off at an extremely low temperature.  We had to complain to the staff 3 times as no-one had the decency to respond to our complaint.  Eventually, the manager came to our room, decided that the area was warm enough (despite my friend and I having spent three hours with all of our clothes and our coats on, huddled together on one bed!!)and we heard no more from anyone that evening.  ON checking out the following morning, there was no apology and certainly no discount for the severe discomfort and disappointment we had experienced!Overall, this was not a nice hotel.  The staff were discourteous and the manager was patronising and unhelpful.  The accommodation was sparse, the decor unwelcoming and cold and the breakfast provided was basic.

The rooms were small and decrepit and dirty.  When my friend would open the door to her room, plaster would fall on her head.  It wasn't long before the entire wooden sign with her room number on it fell from above her door.  That night, at around four in the morning, one of the many rude and nasty desk clerks came banging on her door, DEMANDING to be let in that instant!  Well, guess what? It was 4 a.m., so she was sleeping.  The clerk would not stop banging on her door and shourting until she got up and got dressed.  When she came to the door, he proceeded to yell at her for a full ten minutes, screaming that the sign had fallen off because she slammed the door.  This is not the case.  The sign fell off because the building is falling apart.There is no cold water in the building.  This makes brushing teeth a very unpleasent experience.  Showers can easily leave you with third degree burns.  As you can probably tell from the review thus far, this hotel is horrible.  I haven't even gotten started on the noise level yet!  The hotel is right next to the train station, where trains come in screeching and blowing their wistles at all hours of the night.

The clerk insisted that he be admitted to the room immediately.  Apparently, the only problem was that a sign over the door had fallen off.  That it had was an indication of how poorly maintained the premises are.  The showers were inadequate with no COLD water available, leading to scalding unpleasant experiences.  The elevators were incredibly slow.  The desk clerks, with one exception, were rude or strange or both.Outside, the building is so close to the train station, that all passing trains woke me up.

The proximity to the train station; and 2) A very cordial and helpful gentleman at the front desk on the night shift.The hotel is located on the main street, but the actual entrance is in an alley where sleazy-looking individuals seem to hang out at all hours of the day.  A group was fighting and yelling at each other one afternoon, so I delayed heading to the hotel until the coast was clear just to feel safe.The room and bathroom was simple and clean enough.  The bed was very uncomfortable and left me with a backache in the morning.  The blanket and bedspread were dingy and old.The worst thing was an unreliable wifi.  I had lots,of work to do technology-wise and had to re-enter the username and password each time I turned the units on.  You should only have to do this once during your stay on a good wifi.  It wasted lots of time, not to mention frequent weak signals.Then, there is the elevator situation in the morning.  I was on an upper floor and tried to catch the elevator to the lobby.  the elevator was small, so I let the first one go since it was occupied by a couple and their luggage.  Then, the next two came by filled by one housekeeper and her large cart.  So, if you leave when the housekeepers are ready to start cleaning, know that each car will be taken by all the housekeepers, one at a time.  god only knows how many there are that have to get to their floors!

When we got to the room there was hair everywhere. When traveling in Italy I have come to expect some amount of hair in hotel rooms, but this was just unacceptable. It was literally clinging to every surface and piled up in the corners. We started out by taking some paper towels and removed hair from the bedding. We counted over 40 hairs on top of the bedding alone. After that we just gave up and took some of the towels towels and put them on the ground, so that the hair lying in piles wouldn't stick to our socks when walking around. I have a hard time figuring out how so much hair of different length and colour can accumulate, but I can only presume that the rooms at La Pace are only vacuumed once or twice a year. After taking a trip round the town we went back to the hotel to get some sleep. When we removed the bedding we found two grape pips between it and the sheets. At that point we figured it was more or less par for the course, and removed them and tried not to think about it as we got some sleep.If it wasn't for the extremely poor job they made cleaning this would be a mediocre and somewhat run-down, but not at all bad hotel.

It was strange that the La Pace reception remembered my name for a booking that could not be found.On arrival at our second reservation, 1st June 2012, we were given the keys to room 544.

This had an ancient foam mattress with full length, deep &quot;body&quot; impressions after so many people had used it and the foam had sunk. Underneath was a dirty secondary mattress and underneath that were 2 sheets of mismatched plywood bridging a broken bed base.  The bed was also sunken in the middle but raised at the edges by the oversize plywood.  The foam gave us both an allergic itching sensation.

This is good, but for a few euros extra (about 20 for us) you can stay at the Hotel Francesco whose rooms were better appointed than Helvetia and offer the same free shuttle. For the airport shuttle you have to go all the way to the door of Francesco anyway. We saw Francesco only after booking Helvetia - so we could not change.",-1,0,0.502777778

Our room did not have a/c, and you will need one during the hot days of August in Pisa!  The ceiling fan was so old and made so much noise (even worse on slow speed), that no one in the room slept well!  No cross breeze, so you got to keep cool somehow.  Luckily we only stayed one night, otherwise we would have gone crazy!  Bathroom floor was dirty too!  So basic was the room, that the shampoo was only a small tear-open towelett sized package!  The t.v. was mounted on the wall and the screen was smaller bigger than my Ipod!  But, then again, who has time to watch t.v.  However, the hotel was only a 5 min walk to the tower.  Parking is very, very difficult, so if you got a car...hmmm.  We got lucky and parked outside the wall on the main street, and since it was Sunday and a Monday holiday...parking was free.

Not having air con could have been fine if you the ceiling fan was quieter. It was so loud you couldn't sleep with it on.

There's no elevator and we had to carry your heavy luggage up to the 4th floor.

Breakfast on the terrace is very nice.Cons: We arrived at the B &amp; B during the check-in hours of 12p-4p and rang the bell to get in. No one answered. Sign on the door said to call if you needed someone which was impossible as international travelers with no cell phone.  After we waited for 10 minutes outside in the heat, someone came out and let us in to the main lobby area. Then we rang the bell again and waited until a guest came out of the hotel and kindly let us use their cell phone to call the owner. He said he was &quot;eating lunch and would be there in 15 minutes.&quot; Really? 30 minutes later he showed up. We were under the impression our bathroom was in our room but to our dismay it was next door and we needed a key to get in and out of it. We asked about the internet which they advertised as having and he had no clue what we were talking about. He eventually called his sister-in-law who was apparently the actual owner and later that night provided us with a land connection wire (not wireless). We noticed upon entering this was not the room we booked or saw online. The bed was up a weird set of stairs that were hard to get up and down on. There was 3 sets of keys and one passcode, all separate, to get into the building, room and bathroom which was inconvenient to carry around. The next morning to top it off their credit card machine was down and they said we would need to pay cash (which we did not have since this was our last night in town). The lady ringing us out had to call the owner and finally she agreed to let us leave our credit card number to ring us out later (which we were uncomfortable doing but at that point just wanted to leave).Worst part is this place was more expensive than the one we stayed at the night before in Pisa which was wonderful.

To make matter worse, there is a mosquito flying around my pillow and I couldnt find &amp; kill it all night!!! The bed &amp; pillow was rather hard. My friend who slept upstairs had absolutely no problems though. The location is good. We took a cab from the train station to the hotel and it costs us around 6 Euros.

From the pictures, description and reviews on other websites, we expected luxury accomodation.The hotel is centrally located and very near the tower of Pisa; however, it is in pretty poor maintenance condition, the rooms are tiny and full of dust --as if they had been empty for months. We found on our welcome night a used plaster on the bathroom floor which set our mood for the rest of our stay. If cleanliness is important for you, this hotel would not be a good choice. The roof terrace is not open to the guests --even though you will see some picture on the Internet of it with a table set for breakfast. For breakfast, don't expect freshly squeezed orange juice --rather from a machine, and be ready to drink your coffee from a glass if cups run out.This is more a 2 star hotel plus dirty and depressing. We won't be staying there again, and would recommend anyone against staying.",-1,0,0.578684211
3927013,"We read the reviews of this hotel too late to change our booking. Mistakenly thought that the people who had had bad experiences were either &quot;unlucky&quot; or &quot;too demanding&quot;. Having spent 2 nights in the place I realise they were neither. There is only one word for this hotel, nasty. Our bathroom had patches of discolouration in one corner, the floor was dirty, and the plug in the bathtub didn't work properly. The bedspread didn't appear clean and the armchair in our room was stained. Having pre booked a space in the carpark we were told very rudely on our second night that it was full, and only after considerable complaint did staff move some of their cars to accomodate us. Breakfast was like something from a bad provincial hotel in China, large round tables and a poor selection of food. The public areas and corridors were in need of total renovation. It is in a good location, but that is the only positive thing about it.",-1,0,0.565392434

I think that's it.Run down, worn out hotel, shabby, dark, dirty room.  The room had airconditioning but it didn't work and the room was so hot I couldn't sleep.  I had to jump in the disgustingly dirty shower every half hour to cool down.  Breakfast was pityful - undrinkable coffee out of a vending machine, undrinkable 'juice' - neon pink juice at breakfast isn't my idea of the healthy option.  Some dried up croissants and a minimal selection of cereals.I stayed one night and I couldn't get out of there fast enough.  My advice is that if you want to see the Leaning Tower of Pisa, stay in Florence, go on the train, spend an hour looking at the tower and run back to Florence as fast as you can.",-1,0,0.473152578

The rooms are very basic, kinda run down and could do with a renovation. The lift in the hotel is so old.... we decided to take the stairs just to be safe even though we were on the 3th floor! When checking in to the hotel, the receptionist told is very little info, we actually had to return to reception to ask about things like WiFi access, breakfast and map of Pisa etc. We had an early departure the next day (5:30am) so we requested (actually they offered!) a take away breakfast, but when we arrived at reception the following morning, there was nothing there for us!

I had originally planned to say 2 nights, but after the first AWFUL night we changed hotel.I would like to say to everybody: this is NOT a 4 star hotel as they advertise. I would consider it a 2 star hotel. It's a scam: the pictures on the website do not reflect AT ALL the reality of the rooms and of the hotel. The structure and the inside of the hotel is about 40 years old.We booked a triple room. When we arrived the room we got was much smaller than what advertised. The bathroom was filthy, hairs everywhere. The towels were of a grey-ish color and smelled bad. We promptly requested another room and were given a room that, in the words of the manager of the hotel, is &quot;one of the best in the hotel&quot;. Again, the room was dirty across the board: bed linens, bathroom, bathtub, windows, curtains... the list goes on. In addition there is no sound insulation of any kind. We were woken up by the sounds in the city, but we could also hear very clearly what was going on in the room OPPOSITE to ours....The advertised rate was 160 per night. After much protesting, I at least got a 50% discount...The ONLY positive: it's extremely close to the tower.",-1,4,0.605516934

The breakfast was very  far from a reasonable standard (that in Italy is pretty low !). The most astonishing experience was the bathroom. The toilet was dirty, and when I mean dirty I mean really disgusting. I called the front desk and 30 minutes after a man came up, simply flushed the toilet and then he disappeared without a word.Parking was unbelievable expensive tooOn my departure i wrote a polite letter with my complains, but none really have contacted me later or replayed to my writing.One of the worst hotel experience I ever got in my life.",-1,1,0.516778499
6798859,"Okay, let me begin by saying, that I was prepared for what I got...  Tripadvisor reviews gave me a nice well rounded picture of what to expect with this hotel.  I was staying only for one night and psyched myself up for what might be.  The only good things - the room has Sky TV - many, many channels to distract you from the very depressing room, and of course the fantastic location!  1 minute from Pisa's main attractions.  The negatives - first of all, I couldn't date the place, I just knew it was old, and seriously in need of a reno.  Later when I was at the bar, trying to numb myself before having to trek up to my very lonely, sad, single room, I asked the bartender, and he indicated the hotel is two years away from their 50th anniversary.  The hotel isn't retro cool , it isn't  even shabby chic, just depressingly dim.  The bar and dining rooms have a sort of naf allure, but heading upstairs to the darkly lit, dank hallways, only to enter an even worse room made it a challenge.  It tried to be as clean as possible, however, seeing discarded packaging from the previous guest which hadn't been removed and the odd stray hair in the tub or sink, kind of makes your stomach turn.  The windows couldn't open, the bedspread so horrible I had to physically remove the thing, and absolutely ZERO hot water dribbled from the very poor shower head.  My pictures attached unfortunately do not fully reveal the ugliness of the room - just take my word on it.  My advice is the following:  do research and find something better!  Pisa is quite small, even if you aren't right opposite the tower, you won't ever be that far.  Also, you only need a day in Pisa - don't bother staying on - go to Florence or Siena instead!",-1,4,0.626345515

Then we went to check in and the hospitality of the reception staff was awful. the receptionist hardly aknowledged we were there. she basically threw the key at us and told us the room number. Then we arrived at the room which was nothing at all like i expected after viewing all the pictures over the internet. The room was old and not mainted at all. the furntiure and the decor was awful but we thought as we were only there for one night its not the end of the world until we went to open the window and found the the handle for the window was a bottle opener wrapped in a tissue. we then opened the shutter to sample the view, the view was of a wall just 3 metres away. so we thought we best shut is as it wasnt a view at all until we found that the shutter was jammed and wouldnt shut. at this point we just had to laugh.We then went to complain and again the receptionsit didnt aknowledge us but just gave us a new key for another room. thankfully this room was actually not bad, it must av been an upgrade as it was larger and had a litlle balcony to view the tower.after all this we thought it would be nice to sit on the roof terrace and have a drink. I read before i booked this hotel it had a roof terrace with bar.it had a roof terrace alright which consisted of one chair and a roof to walk on.

You couldnât flush the toilet during the night without having to listen to 15 minutes of âhissingâ from the cistern refilling â and this was through the wall, not because the door was left open. The bed was rock hard too so I didnât sleep well. As I said â breakfast was fine but juice in plastic cups and coffee from a machine are not what I would come to expect from a 4 star hotel.The staff were not exactly friendly but they didnât go out of their way to be rude either.

482279682,"We stayed one night at this hotel and had booked a room with a balcony.The best thing about this hotel is its location. If it isn't the closest hotel to the tower it is one of the closest. The view from both the rooftop bar and our balcony was spectacular. We were able to get a clear view of the tower.In the 80's this would have been a very grand hotel. Unfortunately thirty years have passed for the rest of the world and this hotel hasn't kept up. The public areas of both the lobby and mezzanine are grand however the restaurant, used for breakfast, and the area behind the reception desk, but still visible from the public areas are in urgent need of a major update.We had Apartment A (a bit like a suite). This room was not so grand. The door opens into an area with a small occasional bed/settee that would be suitable for a child. Leading from that is the &quot;lounge&quot; area. This has a bay window with wooden bench seats on either side of it. These seats only have a thin cushion and are not suitable for relaxing on. There are also two upright chairs and a small table.The bathroom is off the &quot;lounge&quot;. This has one of the best showers I've seen in a hotel; it was however spoilt by being in the middle of the bath meaning that you have to stand directly underneath it. When we got to the room the toilet has not been flushed after the previous occupant had used it. We were provided with three sets of towels. Some of these appeared almost new whilst others appeared to need replacing urgently - there was no middle ground!Also off the &quot;lounge&quot; was the bedroom. This had a king size bed, wardrobe, dressing table, mini bar and safe. In the headboard was a clock and radio. The clock told the wrong time and the radio didn't work. The bed was hard and only provided with one thin pillow each. There was another pillow in the wardrobe but that was also thin. There were shutters on the bedroom windows. Through these shutters was access to the balcony. This was big, had a good view but was only separated from the balcony of the next door room and a public balcony by a couple of plants in pots. The balcony had a couple of sun loungers (both too dirty to sit on), two chairs and three deck chairs. One of these chairs was obviously broken with the fabric torn off at one end. When we first got to the room there was an empty beer bottle and a very dirty ashtray on the windowsill. The entire apartment was in need of dusting with the outside of the wardrobe in particular being thick with dust. The dust problem extended onto the corridors as well - the parts of the handrail which weren't constantly being touched also needed cleaning.The hotel does offer free WIFI however we were unable to try it. The signal was so weak that we were unable to logon and ended up using our own, roaming, WIFI.Breakfast was good. There is a decent choice of cereals and juices, hot food (bacon and scrambled eggs), cold meats and cheeses, pastries and sweet goods. I feel that special mention should be made of the machine that makes pancakes although the pancakes it makes are not the best I've ever eaten and the syrup is definitely not maple.All the staff in the hotel were very friendly and spoke passable to good English.I paid â¬180 for the room for the night to include breakfast. I think this was very expensive for what we got. This rate was discounted from â¬200 because we paid in advance.This hotel has the advantage that you are within minutes of the tourist sites and you can get there before most of the tourists - the place is swarming by 9-30 on a weekday. I haven't rated this hotel particularly highly and wouldn't stay here again if I had a choice. However if we were back in Pisa and needed a hotel both with a balcony and close to the tower then I don't think I'd have a choice. If I were just using Pisa airport then Iâd look for a hotel within walking distance of the station.

171247617,"I really do not know where to start with this review... We stayed in this hotel for one night in August 2013 for a stopover at the end of our holiday before leaving from pisa airport (which is about 10 minutes on a bus from the hotel). The purpose of staying in this hotel was to visit the leaning tower and we picked this solely on location. Firstly the location is excellent, the tower is a stones throw from the hotel and was super easy to find. There are a few restaurants around and the area in which the hotel is situated is nice. This however is about as far as it goes as being a good hotel.Upon arriving at the hotel we were quickly checked in and the man at the desk was most helpful and placed us in a room on the top floor with a view of the tower itself. When we arrived at the room it was instantly clear the decor was dated and has not been modernised since the late 70's/80's. The bed was hard and not comfy the tv had plugs hanging out from behind it with no english channels and there was no tea or coffee in the room. Having said that the room was stocked with clean towels and the a/c worked fine and kept the room at a decent temperature. Upon investigating a little further I was disappointed that the phone in the room had some sort of brown liquid over the speaker and earpiece and had clearly not been cleaned prior to our arrival.The room did smell a bit musty as well and could have been cleaned a lot better than it had been.The hotel itself is incredibly dated and although the staff are helpful we would most defiantly not return, it seems such a shame because if this hotel was brought upto standard (it is more like 2 star hotel than a 4) its location coupled with the staff who do try their best would make it an excellent place to stay.Lastly breakfast... One of the worst I have ever had in a hotel, the coffee is from a machine and tastes awful, the meats they stock did not look to brilliant so I did not attempt to eat it.. and the fruit looked like it had seen better days... I ended up with 2 pieces of toast and a yogurt and was most disappointed.Overall... the location of the hotel is amazing, the staff are decent and helpful but it needs a major renovation to bring it close to being 4 star standard.I would recommend staying elsewhere.",-1,0,0.578658537

We were not able to phone the accommodation as connections not available; not their fault.When we finally managed to gain entry to the building a very pleasant young man showed us to our room!! Well we just laughed; the door to our room was obscure glass with a roller blind on the inside, the door would not close properly unless you gave it a good push and with it being glass we were not too keen; we looked around the room; we were totally shocked! with raised eyebrows we though OMG!! the bedroom furniture was a mix of very old pieces and painted sometime ago with all sorts of different colours, blue, yellow, orange drawers with bits of rope for handles; lol!! We were told that the small tray in the writing desk was for putting our drinks on; Why? there were no glasses. The metal fourposter looked as if someone had been swinging on it commented my husband! Must add the bed was okay once we finally managed to get some sleep; the noise from the main road right outside our window was mainly coming from people putting rubbish, empty bottles etc. in the recycle bins opposite our window, (yes we had pulled down the shutters) plus the builders trucks working on the building just down from this accommodation; again not their fault.the bathroom was very clean and bare! no one piece of toiletries! And now for the fun part; The Towels!! When we asked the young man where were the towels he pointed to linen on a (rickety) chair; it looked like 2 table clothes and 2 teatowels; we commented and we were told yes these are better to dry yourself on than towels; we just laughed!!. Oh well we were only going to be there for 3 nights; oh and they were not changed; just as well we bring our own..Other things mentioned to the young man was that the TV did not work; the bedside lamp was broken and the bulbs did not work, this was to ensure him that we had not damaged any of the fittings. The hairdry; well after washing my hair I tried to plug it in it did not fit! no matter how hard I tried! out for the day with wet hair.We mistakenly thought this was a B &amp; B where you get a bed and breakfast, we had not noted this; again not their fault; but the young man kindly offered us breakfast; don't bother; there was nothing hot; coffee really strong; and the cereals tasted like as if they have been in those containers for months! the fruit was bad, and the packet biscuits! Oh!.We were woken early with people leaving, this was due to the glass door, plus we could hear everything that was being said as people left; directions! disputes about cost! etc. again the glass door.Did we expect too much? No! we had paid a reasonable amount for an accommodation to suit our needs! Could we have gotten better? Yes!.

The porter was unfriendly and constantly grumbled, seeming most put out that we'd actually arrived a little earlier than the time of arrival we'd given. When we got to the room it was a bit tatty, although basically fine and we thought it would be a reasonable base to explore Pisa and the area.  Unfortunately, after getting ready for bed we pulled back the sheets to find a number of semen stains along with accompanying hairs on the sheets. We also found a foot-long tear in one sheet.I got dressed and went down to the porter to explain the problem in my faltering Italian. He came up to the room, saw the sheets and then disappeared (grumbling all the time). He returned a few minutes later with new sheets and told us to make ourselves a new bed and to strip the old sheets off and throw them in the corner.  He then left.We proceeded to make our own bed but as we put the new sheets on we noticed more stains - I prefer to think that these new stains were coffee or tea but they could easily have been blood. This time my wife and I took the sheets down with us and asked for another room. He told us this wasn't possible as the hotel was full (this obviously wasn't the case) and he claimed that the marks were &quot;ironing stains&quot;.

We spent most of our one day in the area on a day trip to Lucca via bus -- riding the ramparts on bicycles was great fun!  On returning to Pisa, we spent a couple of hours at the Tower, etc, and then ate a good meal (large inexpensive salads and tasty pizza) at La Lupa Ghiotta, very convenient to the hotel.The positives about our Hotel Milano experience:  It was easy to make online reservations, they were quick to reply to emails, and it was inexpensive.  The desk staff allowed us to leave our bags prior to check in time, saying that one of our two rooms was ready and the bags could be stored in there.  Also, they arranged for a taxi reservation for early the next morning and our taxi did indeed arrive at 5am as scheduled.  It was a very short ride to the airport, 5-10 minutes.The rest of the story:  I want to preface this by explaining that the four of us are accustomed to world travels, we are comfortable with small spaces and tiny bathrooms and lack of air-conditioning.  We were not expecting more than an Italian one star hotel.Our two rooms were next to the front desk, a triple and a double for use as a single.  The windows were permanently closed due to proximity to the street.  As a result, the rooms were stuffy and very hot, and the street noise was quite loud.  The front desk attendant said the A/C for the building was not on yet (though this was the very end of May and the weather was quite hot per our Italian friends) and he did not have access to any portable fans.  We sweltered and were unable to sleep.

It seemed as if all the clubbers parked their cars just below my room window.The hotel is probably as old as the Old Part of Town itself.  A wide steep staircase takes you up to a seedy passage from where you enter your room â most of them onto Via Roma.  The rooms are small.  A small ceiling fan just-just get some air to circulate in the stifling heat of an Italian Summer.  Not much of an audio-difference between an open or closed single pane glass window â except that the smells also get to you, with the noise, when open.No water in the room, no mini-bar.  There is a TV but no remote and no way of switching it on without a remote.The two single beds with lumpy mattresses and really worn-out pillows have clean sheets and threadbare covers.  I managed to find an old blanket in a cupboard drawer.  This helped later at night when it eventually cooled down a bit.The bathroom with a shower, a basin, toilet and bidet is small but functional.  The amenities in little plastic sachets served its purpose.The staff was helpful.  Breakfast was not included but with so many options just around the corner it didnât bother.This is probably a good choice as a quick stay-over for a person traveling on a budget.  Or as a backpackerâs camping site.  The fee I had to fork out however made for a grudge payment.It is really well located and if you know what you are in for, not expecting too much, have a sense of humour and love to stay up really late this can just work.Will I stay there again â not if I can help it.",-1,0,0.33446649

We didn't sleep at all, the room was infested with mosquitos. We woke up to horrible bites everywhere. (Not just one or two mosquitos but we killed around 9 one night)Problem #3) During the day we took a nap and someone knocked, when we answered no one was there, minutes later the fire alarm goes off on our floor (4 rooms only two occupied) and someone had closed the main door of our floor. There was a young man around his 20's hanging out in the room across us and came out with us. I think he was trying to break into our room. He was the only other person in the floor and why would the floor door be closed? Maybe to block sound?Problem #5) REALLY NOISY STREET, people were yelling around like crazy, we could hear all kinds of truck noises...horrible noise until 4 amWe didn't sleep well and were really tired during our trip and the whole scary scene of someone trying to break in our room, really did it for us.

134141928,Stayed here for 2 nights before leaving for home at Pisa airport. The hotel is apparently 5* but I would say it has a long way to go before it is anywhere near 5 star level...The main points are- The 'resturant' is v v poor in terms of food choice and service. It was shambolic at breakfast and we did not enjoy the lunch menu or the toasted sandwiches (which we waited 45 minutes for - and when we were served these they were slid along the tble towards us with no apolgy for the delay and no cutlery). Not 5 star service in my book and yet they are charging 5* prices! - Bizarrly the restuarant is managed not by the hotel and in turn they organise 'private parties' - on our first night we listened to blaring (and i mean blaring) music until midnight and then general shouting and singing until 1.45! Not good with 2 kids of 3 and 7 - on complaining to reception they told me the could 'do nothing as restuarant not managed by them! Ridiculous system as I see this problem happens routinely and yet nothing is done about it. - Rooms were quite nice but sofa bed horribly uncomfortable and kitchen a joke as no implements to use! -Pool ok but again not 5* and nowhere near enough beds or umbrellas. Grass around pool long and unkempt. I noticed a dirty plate lay at the side of a lounger for 2 days!! - Staff not particularly helpful or friendly I certainly would not book this hotel again.,-1,6,0.549269481

641815038,"This hotel will do the job on a quick stay in Pisa. This is not a fancy hotel nor a super posh hotel so don't let the pictures fool you.  It's a bit sad because it has a lot of potential but the upkeep is just not happening. The best way I can describe it is that everything just felt a bit off. At times like the money the money pit where it looked ok but then someone touched a wall or a door knob and it fell off. LOL. I'm sure the manager will reply with some boiler plate response about how my experience is not modus operandi or how they do some things on purpose and to please return.  My review is not intended to have me return to the hotel, I'm only trying to help other travelers. Here is my quick run down of the experience I had.  I'll lead with the bad because I would always rather end on a good note :)Bad:- The rooms are very worn down. There are patch jobs on the walls with mismatched paint. Stained sitting chairs and curtains.- The bathroom was holding on to its 1987 hey day with silhouette labelled pump soap, lotion, shampoo and conditioner. The fixtures looked ok but the sink for example didn't drain well so you had move the stopper (not a big deal) but it had a faint sewer smell when you used it.  The rain shower had no pressure so it was more of a rain sprinkle and the hand wand for the shower was barely staying on the wall.  The holder was on its last leg.  There were also stains on the bathroom ceiling I'm guessing from water damage- Construction or some sort of hammering was going on during the day and they have very thin walls so you can hear EVERYTHING. I actually stayed over Christmas and was told that the 26th was a holiday so the implication was that hammering would not happen that day.  When I came back to the hotel in the middle of the day for a nap (as one does on vacation) of course the hammering was going on for hours.  So I'm pretty sure the receptionist just said that to 'yes ma'am' me away- The hallways are DARK and apparently this is on purpose? I saw other reviews that had the same issue but let me tell you it is very hard to see and makes you wonder what they are hiding.  I believe the standard response from the hotel is that they do that on purpose so that people unconsciously keep their voices down. I asked at the front desk if maybe I was walking past a switch or if there were sensors or something they said that they would have someone look at it.  I never heard back.  If you are visually impaired or physically disabled, this is quite literally a death trap because you can't see in front of you. - They have smoking and non smoking rooms. I am an avid non smoker so I'd want to know if I were traveling.- Pillows were super flat. You could order from a pillow menu but there was a â¬10 fee for that.   - I booked through HotelTonight and the amenities said to have a hot tub and turkish bath. I walked the entire hotel all floors and these amenities were nowhere to be found. It may be seasonal but I never saw it.- We were probably 1 of 4 sets of guests in the hotel at the time so it was dead which probably contributed to the &quot;slightly off&quot; feeling we had. But I don't understand why the staff wouldn't put use in a better room if no one is in the hotel anyways. Seemed like a missed opportunity to get a good review. Especially after my initial questions on noise and lighting. Good- It's cheap for the area. Like I said, I booked through HotelTonight and was a geo deal as I made the call to go to Pisa on a whim- Free parking.  It's an open lot and super easy to get in and out of.  The only thing to see in Pisa is the tower and you can drive about 5mins to a pay lot to park or you can take the 20-25min walk. The receptionist might tell you its a 15min walk but unless you come from a city where you walk everywhere it's closer to 25mins. Also fair warning, the streets aren't lit at night so if you do choose to walk it can be scary. We drove so we had no issues and because it was over Christmas there was a lot less traffic- Pets stay free.  Huge plus to have our furry family member with us on road trips and he was totally at home here- The room we got was a garden room and it had a nice view.  We got lucky with some sunny afternoons so that was nice to sit in the sun. The hotel also has tower views so if you get a room facing the front of the hotel you can wake up to the tower of Pisa.- Cleanliness. Despite being rundown the bed and linens were clean, towels too. We didn't feel grossed out.  For a one or two night stay its does the job.- Views were great, there is a roof deck that I assume in summer is set up but you can go up there and get some great pictures. Also on the roof deck they have a small gym.  If you need to get your sweat on, it's not huge but it will do the job just fine.- The lobby seems nice, its welcoming the staff are courteous.",-1,3,0.578759259

196937651,"Stayed in this hotel in July 2013 with two children.  Room was clean, big enough for the four of us (separate bedroom + sofa-bed) and pool was huge and very refreshing in those hot summer days.  Breakfast (included) was good and a lot of different items on the menu.  However I can't recommend this hotel - I would even strongly suggest for you to find another.  Here are my three main issues.  The latter two may not be that important to everyone, but the first one is clearly a deal-breaker:1- When we arrived in our room, the a/c was working but it was set at a high temperature.  So we lowered it a few degrees - unfortunately this had the rather strange and very unpleasant effect of having the A/C shoot very HOT air in the room.  In minutes it was sweltering hot, so we called the front desk.  They said they would reset it and we should be OK.   We were not.  The hot air continued to be blown into the room, so we called again.  After one hour of this, our room was basically a sauna.  The repair guy finally came, did not speak a word of English or French so we had to call the front desk to ask them to translate what he was saying.  He had no clue what to do and basically said we had two choices:  keep it running (with the hot air), or shut it off  completely.  Obviously we chose to turn it off.  Despite our numerous phone calls and complaints, the hotel never fixed this problem in the two days we were there (didn't even TRY to fix it on the second day), so we ended up in a room with no A/C for 2 nights in July, with no apologies and no efforts on the hotel's part to fix the problem.2- The hotel restaurant is AWFUL.  We wanted a quick supper on our first night there, so we did not order any appetizer, just our 4 plates, and we were seated for over THREE hours - and the food was not even good.  The hotel said it wasn't their problem, the restaurant is run by another company.  If I was the owner of the hotel and I allowed another company to offer food in my property, I would make sure it offered at least decent food and decent service.  3- The Wi-Fi is relatively quick, but we constantly had to request new passwords because as soon as you stopped using your iPad or iPhone, it logged you off.  Not very useful when you are trying to book the remainder of your trip.  In our two days there we had to ask for a password over 20 times.  The front desk seems accustomed to this, they just hand out the little papers over and over.",-1,2,0.543562902
174987123,"The hotel was not up to other 5 star hotels in Europe. A request for a pool towel was ignored, room service dishes left in the corridor all day, hotel shuttle service overpriced, pool beds were very uncomfortable, mould in shower and no customer feedback forms (understandingly). Pisa is nice, Lucca was better. The beach facilities in Tirennia are excellent. The bus and trains are easy to use and cheap. The bus stop is by the hotel entrance and costs 1.5 euro adult. The nearby camping park is handy for a reasonably priced meal and drinks.Be careful crossing the busy main road which is unavoidable when walking to and from Pisa.",-1,0,0.631547619
234194145,"Ok first things first.  5* ?  Not really- think more along the lines of 3* UK hotel and you won't be far off.  LocationLocated in the outskirts of Pisa - about 20 mins in taxi from airport, about 10 minutes in taxi to tower etc or a 20 minute walk.  I did the walk which was ok but in the heat not pleasant.  Also the walk will take you through a long and very unglamorous subway - I certainly wouldn't want to take the walk after dusk.Check inFine, details all correctRoom - no 24Nice large room, clean and plenty of storage.  Good TV, big bed, mini bar.  No tea of coffee facilities which is strange for a 5* hotel ?   Let down for the room was the bathroom - not sure what had been going on but it was very dirty.  Dust all around the sink, grubby between the tiles, missing grouting.  Was obviously a problem with a leak as the ceiling was still quite stained and had a poor repair job on it.  Bathroom smelt very damp.  No bath just a rain shower which was very weak.Lobby / loungeNice, smart and plenty of seating.  Asked at reception if I could get a coffee served - was told that someone would be straight with me.  After 20 minutes I gave up.  There were plenty of staff about just no one interested in serving.  Restaurant Nice big steaming bowl of pasta was looking lovely as was the desert â¬24 - service was excellent and very attentiveCheck outHad time to spare so asked about left luggage.  This consists of just leaving your cases in an office with no receipts issued.  General guests just wandering in and out leaving and taking luggage with no checks so at your own risk basically.

I expressed my shock and dissapointment, as wouldn't never have paid so much for such a far away location without the pool. The receptionist couldn't care less and sent me off to my room. When I arrived it was dirty, with soiled sheets on the bed. I then had to wait around for a new room, which didn't open. All in all, I was up and down the stairs with a heavy case 3 times.

The swimming pool was not yet ready for the season we were told. This was a major disappointment. We saw the swimming pool which was far smaller than the photo in the advert suggested. Our room was clean and tidy. However, it was noisy as the toilet would not stop filling and the electrics in the room were complicated and difficult to operate. Some of the plug sockets did not work.

95037148,"I would like to warn everyone about the quality of service in the 5 star hotel The Abitalia Plaza received during my stay from 26-30th Sept with my family.There were a number of issues, relating to cleanliness, staffing levels and staff attitude and service levels during my stay some of which were rather menial some of which were very serious.Upon first arrival we had to go back down to reception and work out on our own that you could ask for a WIFI password.  We first tried the computers next to the restaurant.  Two units were there, one would not even turn on and even if it had functioned had no mouse.  The other was in use, and once the other customers had finished I tried to use it but simply loading a webpage (gmail) took five minutes+ until I got bored and gave up.Then we moved to try to get a drink from the bar. Firstly we had to walk both from reception and into the hotel a couple of times waiting for someone to appear. Finally a barman appeared and offered us a cocktail list.  For a 5 star hotel having a couple of martinis is not what I consider a cocktail list.Later on in the day I went to the pool.  The pool was very easily noticeably dirty especially in the paddling area where dirt was obvious all around it, and the lounge pods near it were full of dirty brown water clearly not emptied/cleaned for weeks.  When my brother in law chose to use the stairs it became obvious they were loose and could be rocked about Â½ metre out of the ground.  After this we did not use the pool as it was clearly amazingly dangerous and a complete health and safety disaster. We then went upstairs to check on the sauna/gym/emotional shower facilities as we did not want to use the pool at this point.My girlfriend had read about the âemotional showerâ before our visit and was excited to try it.  When I looked inside I found it to be full of spider webs and a spider was there at eye level in the corner next to the inside door frame.  I was upset to see this as she would have gone crazy had she seen it so I persuaded her to wait until tomorrow expecting it would be cleaned.  When I returned the next afternoon I had to work out how to use the shower and wash this away myself which shows your facilities are not being cleaned adequately.  The web was clearly visible and around Â½ m in diameterThen we decided to use the restaurant where we were seated not in the comfortable booths but in the table in the centre of the room. We were not asked if we had a preference and there was only 1 other couple in the entire place. Then we received the menus.  Having checked the stack later out of curiosity you should know that over 50% of the menus do not contain any prices, and during our meal I had one with prices and my girlfriend did not which made it very confusing.  Your menu is also in English but makes no sense as it does not tell you which are starters, first/second courses. I had to ask the waiter to explain it.  The English just says, some dishes, some more, and the best ones, reading like it is all main courses. Then we asked for the Fiorentina steak between us thinking we would enjoy the local speciality.  When it came out the âmediumâ (not medium-rare) we had asked for was nowhere to be seen with blood clearly still running out of the entire steak and my girlfriend was so upset I had to send it back to be cooked more. At the end of the meal I was also not offered the option of paying immediately which I prefer, and I had to sign it onto the account.This lead to a further problem, on checkout when I came to pay for the room bill we had to checkout at 4.45 AM.  I had to wait around 30 minutes for the receptionist to click his mouse 100 times then finally tell me he was unable to take part cash for the payment as he had begun it as a card payment. Firstly I wanted to spend my remaining Euros but was forced to put it on my card, secondly I refuse to believe his excuse that he could not cancel and begin again and thirdly my taxi had to wait for 20 minutes while he did all this which should have taken 30 seconds. A complete disgrace.During the main stay we had endless issues.  At 12pm on the 29th Sept our room was called and we were asked why we had not checked out yet.  I was mortified and ran immediately to the booking forms to double check whilst my girlfriend spoke to the reception.  Then she told the receptionist it should have been the next day we left and the receptionist immediately checked and within 5 seconds told her we were correct.  How incompetent are your staff not to have made whatever basic check it was first and cause me the anguish of thinking I had booked incorrectly and also disturbing my holiday.Then on the 27th or 28th we left our room to be cleaned sign out.  We went into Pisa for 4 hours, came back and it had not been done. Then we went out later again and when we returned home our room had finally been cleaned but without changing bed sheets/pillows. They had just been placed on the bed and not turned down.  Now if I was staying in a 2 star hotel then I would not complain but this is a 5 star hotel and If my room needs cleaning, whatever time I leave it, it should be done properly.  As a result of this we checked the room more thoroughly to notice that the chairs were never moved ever as there was a pile of dust marks around it.  Also our room service plate was not cleared away either and it was just a very sloppy serviceNow on to the room service.  One night when we came home we had not been able to find anywhere nice to eat so we got back to the late night room service menu.  My girlfriend was hungry and whilst I had gone to bed she ordered a cheese and ham toasted sandwich.  The person on reception spoke English well and she thought nothing of it until 2 arrived, and not much of a fusser and it being late she let it go, but still we effectively paid for 2 items when we only wanted one.  The other issue is that the late night menu for room service only has 3 items on it.  Of this my sister attempted to order one of them and was told by the receptionist or some staff member it was unavailable as he could not find it.  Again a complete disgrace for a 5 star hotel.  Cold tuna pasta is not that appetising at best but the fact it was 30% of the menu and not available is terrible.The room cleaners when they did turn up also were very pushy, aside from the language barrier I had to go and intervene when the room cleaning lady was just speaking Italian to my girlfriend who was saying sorry that she does not speak Italian and the cleaner just kept going on at her.  My girlfriend was so mad about this, combined with the fact that 10 minutes later an unfriendly hotel reception/staff member knocked on our door, again forcing us to put something on as we were mid getting ready who asked us âdo we want out room cleaning or notâ, that I almost had to check us out into another place.  In a five star hotel it gets cleaned when I want it cleaned, and I donât expect to have angry staff turn up at my door telling me off for not speaking Italian or not being ready to clean my room or to have my girlfriend shouted at by the cleaner in a language she does not understand. We were both in towels so this is clearly obvious it was not possible. The worst thing that happened however was that (as I discovered later) there should have been a bottle opener in my room (it was in my sisters).  There was not and this led to me thinking how stupid it was for the hotel to provide Orangina drinks which were not screw top in a minibar.  My girlfriend wanted one and because of all the other issues and poor support I decided I would open it myself using a coin.  I then slipped and cut my hand, quite severely so it was a deep large cut down to the bone, but not severely enough that I felt I needed to go to hospital.  I immediately just held the skin together to stop the bleeding and said to my girlfriend that I think that if I donât get a plaster or bandage I would need medical attention as it was quite bad.  She then went down to reception to be told that they could not help and that she should go to the chemist in PISA. Working in a hotel herself and looking after my interests she plucked up the courage to force the issue and asked why they had no plasters or medical kit.  This is a legal requirement for employees if not for guests. Then the girl made her ask another few times pointing at the plaster the receptionist was clearly wearing herself. I might add that its compulsory for kitchen staff too not only health and safety regulations in general.  Then she spoke in Italian to another desk staff member who said oh yes maybe he did have it, then would not get up and made her walk all the way around the desk to get the medical supplies.  For a 5 star hotel and me to have hurt myself, in part due to the poor standard of finishing the hotel is incredible, but to have such a problem finding medical help or even kind or helpful staff is so far beyond unacceptable I was lost for words. All I could say is that if I had not only have had a single night left I would have checked out at this point and that this story once you have had your right to response to me will be finding its way onto every trip advisor site I can find.Also no 5 star hotel doesnât have a kettle and tea and coffee in the room, nor an iron or ironing board.Then the final straw was that on the last night there was some kind of taxi issues and the hotel arranged a taxi into town for us.  We then could not find any taxi ranks in Pisa so I rang the hotel for help to book me one back to them.  They refused, they told me I could have a taxi number and that was all they would do.  As a result I ended up making a ten minute international rate mobile call to a number which never picked up/was a waiting noise.  It could have had options to press but I do not speak Italian so no person ever answered.  Then we ended up taking a 1 hour walk home late at night under the subway which neither my girlfriend or my sister enjoyed and both were very scared, and got back to the hotel around 1.30/2pm and we had to leave at 4.45 am so this made everything worse, and put a very sour note on what had been my birthday night out in Pisa. To add to this two prostitutes flagging down cars at the bus stop across from the car park entrance from the main road were there when we got back, showing clearly this is not a safe place to be left stranded by a 5 star hotel too lazy and inept to help me get back there.  If anything had have happened during this walk this would have been in court not in complaint letter form.And after our check out being delayed and the payment not as I asked, being charged for extra room service and made to wait, the taxi booked for us from the hotel cost 25E when we arrived at the airport, at least double every late night, Sunday or daytime taxi we had took in our entire visit. And the firm you booked were incredibly rude, and almost killed us driving on the wrong side of the road the whole journey to the airport cursing us and complaining to us.I wonât even go into the unfinished parts, and the messy upper deck being a complete disappointment or the outside pool tables/light/lights in the sofa outside area not working at night.The stay in your hotel was a complete disaster, your staff are rude and inept, the service very poor and the attention to detail even worse.  I have never had a worse experience in 4 days in any hotel and for this to be a birthday holiday with my girlfriend and family it was completely ruined by the Abitalia Plaza.  This hotel needs to be closed,finished then opened again once itâs staff are trained",-1,0,0.420743476

When we arrived the reception area looked so beautiful. The picture of the rooms online lead us to believe this was going to be a great hotel. But i am afraid the pictures online are just there for advert. Please do not get fooled like we were. I did not even look to see if this hotel had tea or coffee in the room, that is usually there in a 3/4 hotel. My Mistake. No tea or coffee in the room. What made it worse the hotel restaurant was a different business, so nothing was added to your bill. You had to pay that separate. Room service was $8, each time. Also rooms were only made up before 12 midday, so if you had a lay in and went out after 12 the room never got made up.  It offered a Limo service into town,train station or airport. So we went for this service when we checked out. There was no limo just a large grey car. The air conditioning did not work, we spoke to them about that and they said it was not switched on until we had been down and asked on out second day. But even then it did not work. The tv is quite a distance away from the bed but the volume control was set so you could not raise it. Strange thing was in the bathroom there was a speaker in the ceiling and you could hear the tv great in there. But then could not see the screen.

The bedrooms had mold on the walls and although the room was clean it wasn't as clean and tidy as you would expect from a 5* hotel. This was advertised as having a hotel spa. A shower and a running machine does not mean that it has a spa. Okay it was winter and the swimming pool was closed but there was major damage to the pool and arounding area. this area should have been closed off to the public as it was dangerous. It was luck we didn't have any young children with us as this would have been a major issue. The breakfast was one of the worst I have every experienced and I have stayed in a wide variety of hotels and different ratings and can say this was the worst by a long way. The hotel is a good 20 minute walk from Piza itself and you will spend a lot of money on taxis going back and for or send most of your time walking. There are many things that need to be sorted in this hotel to get anywhere near a 5*. I would strongly recommend not going to this hotel and if you do, don't expect anything close to a 5* experience more like a 2-3*.",-1,0,0.537980769

To be fair, we were given 2 normal  rooms at a slightly reduced price, but I would not have booked had I known this.- too little staff in general. a 30 minute wait to check in, 20 minute to check out, no luggage porters, ...- breakfast buffet is included but everything is served on a single table and generally mayhem as a result - pool bar is managed by a separate company and VERY expensive. EUR73 for 4 pizzas and a few cokes....? Really?- the rooms and hotel are quite modern in their decoration but even though the hotel is not that old, it was a bit run down already with water stains on the ceiling in the bathroom, etc- the 3rd night there was a large reception in the pool bar, just below our rooms with music playing loudly into the late hours. We were not informed of this when we booked or even when we were there. Not good.- WAY too few sun loungers around the pool.  I counted 26 for a hotel with 100+ rooms.  Every few minutes guests would show up and not find a lounger, then being forced to sit on the ground    or in the bar.- the site is surrounded by 3 roads so when you sit by the pool you see cars driving by and are overlooked by neighbours.

The only good thing about this hotel was the reception staff. so thank-you to them!The room wasnt cleaned properly, shower unit wouldnt work properly and was dirty, the TV didnt work properly, Air conditioning wasnt working either. oh yes and the bed wasnt made properly, we had to do that as well! Upon taking a walk around the hotel to find something nice it was like walking around a ghost town. Roof terrace was empty, bar closed. Outside area by the pool deserted and hadnt been cleaned or looked after for many months.  The hotel has a restaurant which isnt owned by them and only offers specific food which is ok, however, if your ordering room service you cant have a snack. You must order something from their own set menu. Not even a basic dish available.The menu arrived on a hand written piece of paper because no menu's were available..... The breakfast was frankly awful. How can a 5 Star ITALIAN hotel serve COFFEE from a vending machine!!!! Couldn't believe it. Having stayed in other Italian hotels which were not 5 star, they made a point of making fantastic coffee to start your day with. The pastries were of poor quality, yoghurt was warm, staff didn't offer any form of customer service, not even a smile. It appears to me that this was intended as an upmarket hotel when it was built and has been left to waste away. Perhaps due to dwindling guest numbers and poor trip advisor reviews which have been consistently bad for a while and although this hotel responds to its reviews it doesn't appear to do anything to change!

The next night was a very different story, we returned to the hotel after sightseeing all day and wanted a  night cap drink in the bar, it was impossible as it was so loud with heavy music and packed with non residents so we went up to our room. We attempted to go to sleep but due to the heavy, loud, boom boom music underneath our room in the restaurant and bar area it was impossible. We rang the reception at 11pm to inform them of this only to be told they could do nothing about it as the hotel is run by two different companies and the bar area was separate to the hotel! the music carried on getting even louder at times and eventually stopped at midnight. The next morning as we left the hotel to sightsee we spoke to the reception and told them of the incident and we were told this was to be expected as it is Italy!! we were told our complaint would be passed to management as we would be contacted that day, it never happened and when we checked out the next morning we were not asked anything about it and not even asked if we had a nice stay or if everything was ok!The breakfast is poor, the bread in the toaster has to pass though four or five times to be toasted, the hot water for tea and coffee is cold, the bacon and powered scrambled egg is the only hot food and the bacon was fatty and thick grease and the only egg was florescent orange.

The rooms are very cold not only because of the single pane glass but also because the thermostat is set low. It took two calls to get it adjusted high enough that it wasn't extremely cold in the room. They need to adjust it from the main controls at the front desk...(or somewhere other than your room). The showers are a little slice of Hades. The constantly fluctuate between scalding and freezing. The manager should be forced to stay in one of the rooms for a week.

I realized that it is a bit far from the center but I sacrificed central location to a better living. I was mistaken. This place is not a 5 star luxury venue any more. I would rate it 3 stars honestly. The design of the lobby and common areas resembles that it was a 5 star resort some years ago. Now the resort deserves some repairs and washing. Yes, the hotel heavily needs proper cleaning. It relates both too the rooms and the common areas. The bathroom equipment in my room looked like it has never been washed. It was all covered with calcium plaque. Some if the wall tiles were broken. There were many scratches, stains etc. So I would suggest the management to do immediate repairs.

I was surprised to see that instant juice drink is offered at breakfast. I have got more accustomed to natural juices at the hotels.  I am not even suggesting a fresh squeezed juice that is offered at all gas stations in Italy but surprisingly is not offered at some &quot;5 star resorts&quot;.

The service is indifferent at best; front desk people try their best, but warmth is not one of their strong points. - The worst was the restaurant manager who went I told him that the wine we ordered by the glass was corked (it smelled like mold), said that we put something in it! This has to be one of the most ridiculous things a restaurant person has ever said to me! Not sorry for serving us corked wine, or apologizing and bringing us another glass, but accusing us of creating a weird mold smell in the wine! We were there as part of a conference too, so lots of people witnessed this... - The rooms were supposed to be stylish, but it's definitely a quick-and-cheap approach to style: furniture is very worn, things are not working properly, towels and sheets are scratchy, paint is falling off walls. The cleaning service didn't restock things properly, for example no extra toilet paper roll or soap. - Wifi system is silly: you need to keep entering different user name and password every day.- The pool is sitting there empty and sad in mid May; the gym is a joke (a couple of elliptical machines, a few free weights and a single-person wet sauna).- The breakfast is simply terrible! Unappetizing sweet cakes, cold eggs, stale bread and machine-made coffee, accompanied by sullen servers who have no desire to make your stay better. Dinner is atrocious and ridiculously priced.- Location is pretty terrible too; a very far walk to town, and if you call a taxi, there's an automatic 6.25 euro charge for &quot;call fee&quot; in addition to the fare. Overall, if you've never stayed at a five-star hotel (or four, or three), you might love this place and delight in your obnoxious children running around screaming with no staff asking them to behave, or appreciate the lack of smiles and flavors in the restaurant, or take in the views of parking lots and highways, or come back for the &quot;resort&quot; elements like an empty pool.

The food was indifferent and the bread/pastries very dry and old. Our main concern however was the complete indifference of the staff, (except one reception lady). My sister fell down several stairs on the first morning as there was no lighting in the stair well. She quite badly banged her arm and side. We mentioned this to the reception safe who just shrugged his shoulders. We asked why there was no lighting, no answer. It took until the last night to rectify this and then the next morning it was off again.Be aware that it is quite a trek into the town along the awful underpass and across a very busy road crossing, we had to run across each time. I do think it would be nice if there was a free transfer for guests into town.I would certainly not stay here again, and would recommend others think carefully before booking, especially if you have children or if mobility is an issue.Judging by the mangers remarks on previous poor reports he is not going to like this one!!",-1,2,0.537231041
414240309,Ok.. so let's start with the positives... The Location was GREAT.. but ONLY if you had a car. I certainly would NOT liked to have walked to and from the centre with children. The rooms themselves were OK? The bathroom was a bit grubby but with a bit of a rinse around the shower we survived.The quality of linen and pillows were poor. I really would expect 2 pillows per person and for them to be of good quality but then this is a hotel pretending to be a 5 star hotel!The pool was lovely however and it was nice to be able to return after some hot sightseeing for a swim.And now the negatives... well this is by no means a five star hotel. Not even close. This is a very average 4 star hotel and if they had advertised this as a four star then actually I would have given it a very different write-up. There is absolutely nothing 5 star about this hotel whatsoever. Breakfast is not included and the choice was so minimal we ended up at a delicious local cafe for a tenth of the price.And whatever you do... do not book a room near the road.. ask for a &quot;PoolSide&quot; room otherwise you will be kept awake ALL night by the noise of the very busy dual carriageway next door!,-1,3,0.588019481
131622682,"The hotel is well fitted out, the rooms are of a good size and the beds are very comfortable.  We really enjoyed relaxing by the pool during our stay.Unfortunately when we visited in June 2012 there were plumbing problems throughout the hotel with filthy brown water in the bathrooms and spa   When asked staff said that work was being undertaken on the pipes, but were given no indication of when this would be resolved, luckily we were only staying for one night. Generally there were very few staff and the service was very blasÃ©, not what you would expect from a five star hotel.The hotel is situated out of town, about a 15 minute walk from the main sights. The walk into Pisa involves crossing a very busy road with no formal crossing or pedestrian footpath. Also when returning to the hotel after dinner, we came across a number of scantly clad ladies stood on the road outside the hotel offering their services!We enjoyed our time in Pisa but found the Abitalia Tower a disappointing.",-1,1,0.588333333
176638715,"Five star hotel? There is no concierge, staff were very unhelpful. Prior my arrival I have emailed them asking about local places to eat and the reply I  received, that there is a tourist center in the town. Forget about help with luggage at the hotel, and asking for directions to places to go. No response. Room we were given was full of dust, and shower gel and other toiletries half way used by previous guest. In my email I have specified that it was our special occasion, nothing has been acknowledged or mentioned and we felt treated by staff very rude. On a check in we asked if breakfast was included, the answer was yes. However the breakfast was terrible, cold coffee, cold eggs, and we were charged. In the morning I have asked for water, they told me that water comes with a charge, which is fine, but in every five star hotel \i have stayed Id expect water to freshen up on my arrival. I didn't expect that. I don't understand how this hotel is five star? No concierge, no luggage service, staff was rude and very unhelpful. Never go back again.",-1,2,0.435868347

The noise of construction only stopped late on Sunday night and started again next day. Our complaints were however heeded eventually, in a distrustful and surly way.The next day we were moved to another room where the airconditioning although efficient could not be controlled from the room! Having to place calls to reception to turn it on and off. Having to contact the front desk was not a pleasure at any time.Staff are generally poor.Maybe worth visiting when it is finished, currently no spa or third floor bar at and no shuttle to town or airport.

221152778,"We booked this hotel for two separate overnight stops in Pisa. On the first weekend, we noted that the floor was grubby (hairs, fluff and crumbs) but decided to let it pass thinking it was a one-off oversight. On our return visit, we were allocated the same room and told it was ready for occupancy. On arrival in the room, we realised it had not been cleaned and still had the old bedding, dirty towels etc so informed reception and waited half an hour for the cleaning to be done. Keen to use the pool before the last of the sun, we returned to note that the floor was again very grubby with long blonde hairs, dust balls and crumbs again. All were easily seen. We informed reception again who said they were sorry. There was no real sense of regret or sense that customer service was important at all. Although they said they would try to find someone to have a look at the floor, it was now approaching evening. We have stayed in many hotels ranging from 2 to 5 stars and this was at best a 3 star. It is a chain hotel that is a triumph of style over substance and customer service is sadly lacking. On both occasions, the corridors would also have benefitted from a really good hoovering. This experience really spoiled the end of a lovely holiday. The fact that we have taken the time to write this reflects that feeling.",-1,0,0.439772727

There was no one to pick us up, so we rented a taxi.  When we arrived at the address, the door to the business was locked.  We couldn't go in with our luggage, because the owners of the apartments in the building yelled at us to get out.  We were harassed (in Italian) by two women in particular.  It was very uncomfortable and not a good start to our trip.  We tried to call the owner of Il Giramondo and no one would answer the phone.  After about 3 hours, we gave up and found a hotel.  I cannot recommend this place after our experience.",-1,0,0.572222222
115365369,"Stayed here for a night this month. Was surprised to receive an e-mail a few days beforehand telling me to ring the hotel half an hour before my arrival time, since it wasn't routinely staffed, but dropped them an email with the appropriate time anyway. Nobody present on arrival, so I called the number provided only to receive a Spanish voicemail message. Fortunately, the Tourist Information Centre in Pisa were able to help - I can't thank them enough for their assistance - and made contact with the management.The lady who welcomed me was warm and friendly, but I was most struck by the two signs on arrival - one asking guests to pay immediately on arrival, and another asking for positive reviews on TripAdvisor! The first led me to wonder what sort of guests the hotel was expecting, especially as they had already taken card details at the time of reservation. The room itself was incredibly dated, and the 'private external' bathroom situated at the other side of the B&amp;B entirely. You had to walk through the shower to reach the toilet, a novel arrangement to say the least. There was a strong smell of disinfectant; I wasn't sure whether to be concerned or relieved.On my return to the hotel after an evening in Pisa, I was surprised to meet a couple in the same situation as I had been previously - they had to ask at a restaurant to make contact with the B&amp;B's management. Apparently guests arriving late had been known to ring random properties in the building at midnight in an attempt to gain access to the rooms they had reserved. This hotel could be great - it's well situated in the centre of Pisa and structurally sound.  But as it is, I can't honestly give it more than one star - had I been 45 minutes later in Pisa, by which time the Tourist Information Centre would have closed, I would not have been able to check in. But based on the quality of the hotel, perhaps that would have been an advantage.",-1,1,0.481166932
518691855,"I booked this place on booking.com thinking it looked nice in the photos. Got to the &quot;hotel&quot; to find it was actually a block of residential apartments - I thought I was booking a hotel or a B&amp;B and there is nothing on the booking.com website to say otherwise. Though there was a yellow sign with the name of the &quot;B&amp;B&quot; on the outside of the building, about 5cm x 20cm, there was nothing else on any of the floors to indicate that there was actually a B&amp;B being run here. I called the number I was given on the booking and was told it was actually a flat, and that I was renting a room in a flat... I wasnÂ´t aware that Booking.com had starting running Airbnb style accomodation, but given the late hour and that fact that I had a  lot of luggage, I figured beggers can't be choosers. The person I spoke to told me that she'd be there in 5 minutes - there is NO on-site assistance. After 10 minutes, no one had shown up so I called again and got no answer. I then tried to call booking.com and was put on hold for quite some time. The short story is that the person never showed up to let me in the flat, I had to find another hotel at last minute and drag my luggage around Pisa, and the next day I had a charge on my credit card for the accomodation that I was never able to enter. Booking.com have now washed their hands of the problem (itÂ´s my word against the owner's that she never turned up), and I have had to take it up wth my credit card. I'll add that the lobby of the place is infested with mosquitos - beware those that are allergic (I am). The lift can only be operated if you have a special key to open it. I walked up the stairs to the very top to ensure I wasÂ´'t missing anything and there was no other sign of a B&amp;B on any floor. The owner's english is quite poor, but she was able to acknowledge that I had a booking and tell me that she'd be there in 5 minutes - but don't expect any additional help unless you speak Italian.  I would avoid this one like hell fire. I have used booking.com many times, as well as airbnb. I am a seasoned traveller, from back-packing around the world as a student to city breaks and beach holidays as an adult to fly and drives... you name it, I've done it (or will be in the near future!).

The hotel may once have been splendid, but I found it now to be dusty and neglected:  the public areas crammed with artificial flowers which didn't look as if they been cleaned for years, the rooms shabby - necessary repairs to the furniture not made, and all in need of a lick of paint.The plumbing in my room was in a sorry state:  by the time I had finished my (very quick) shower (in the bath) I was standing almost to my knees in water which slowly drained away at dripping pace.I will remember my short stay in Pisa for all the wrong reasons!",-1,4,0.637777778

We have just returned from an amazing Italian adventure.  We booked this hotel in Pisa.  We specifically booked an upgrade river view as we stayed 6 years ago in a huge river view room. After 4 hours on the train from Rome we took a taxi to the hotel.  A very unconvincing receptionist told us that there was a problem with our room, they were fully booked so she had booked us into another hotel in Pisa.  There was no apology, no offer of someone to show us the way to the hotel or indeed help us with our bags???  There appeared to be no other option so we picked up our cases and walked some streets to find this back street hotel.The hotel room was tiny.  The bedding was stained.  The shower was dirty.  We couldn't put our valuables in the safe.  The view was into the building opposite.  This was such a disappointment.As we were staying in Pisa for only one night and by this time it was 5pm we simply had no choice but to stay there.  We did go back to tell the lady at Royal Victoria that this hotel room was not on a par with what we had booked, mostly so that she wouldn't do this to other guests.  Again, she was just rude.I would advise not to book this hotel as on reflection I can see from tripadvisor that we weren't the first that this has happened to.

Dead pigeon on the windowsill across the alley was gross for the teen girls with us.  The beds were exceptionally hard and the linens, although clean, were stiff.  Breakfast was cereal and bland croissants. The walk to the Leaning Tower and cathedral was approx. 15 minutes.  They close the road in front of the hotel each night from 8-1am due to the number of drunk people hanging out at the bridge and on the road in front of the hotel that fronts the river - the police officer who guided us in said it was so the drunk pedestrians did not get hit by a car.

Apparently the hotel is going to be renovated, that is good because it badly needs renovation. &quot;Shabby chic&quot; had its quixotic charm in the public areas, but our room was awful, simply awful. Shabby chic would have been a vast improvement. The room was large and not decorated at all....just bare walls, twin beds (we booked a double which turned out to be &quot;2 adults&quot; which does not mean &quot;married couple&quot; and was annoying). Also, one small table with small inadequate lamp between the beds, one dresser with a useless mirror, so low it stopped at my shoulders (I'm 5'3&quot;). Also, a wardrobe and two chairs from the breakfast room. That's it. Huge room, bare.  The beds were made up with sheets that were too small and became untucked easily to reveal the mattress cover:  a bathroom towel!   It looked like the convent we think it probably was, although I would suspect that the nuns might have thought this room was part of some larger plan of penitence and accepted it on that basis. The bathroom was tiny, not super clean. Thank goodness for the wide windowsill, otherwise there would have been zero place for bathroom items. Where to put the luggage? On the dining chairs, which were much too small really but were pressed into service. In short, the room was cold in feeling and was pretty much a dump. We would never stay there again or recommend it to anyone. Yes, the people were nice (they're in the hospitality business....) and yes the breakfast was okay, no different than any other hotel. But the room was awful. It also overlooked an area that is populated late into the evening by lots of young folk having lots of fun....nice for them but the noise level was bad until about 1:00 AM.

372616826,"From the outside, the hotel looks lovely. It's in a great location right on the river and only a 15 minute walk from the train station. Then you get inside. The whole hotel is like something from a horror movie, think Disney's Tower of Terror. It had a very uncomfortable feeling about it. Had I been a solo traveller there is absolutely no way I would have stayed here.The first room we were given was room 107. They use old skeleton keys for the doors which make them extremely difficult to open, after about 5 minutes of trying to get into the room I had to go down to reception to get help.Honestly, I wished I'd left it locked. The room was absolutely appalling. The windows were rotting so badly you could see daylight through the wood and the shutters, needed to block out the light as there were no curtains, didn't close properly. Because the room overlooked the river this meant it was on the busy main road at the front of the hotel. The noise was unbelievable, it was as if the cars were driving straight through the middle of the room!There were dirty marks all over the walls, chips out of the plaster and a huge crack down one of the walls. The light above the door did not have a cover, just a bare lightbulb and one of the plug sockets was hanging out of the wall. The bathroom was ok apart from the shower not being wall mounted and was instead attached to the bath taps.How any respectable hotel could think that the room was acceptable to give to a customer is beyond me.We asked to change rooms because of the road noise and the terrible state of the room. The man at the front desk initially said that they had no other rooms available. As we couldn't face staying a night in that room we told him that we wanted to checked out and that we'd find another hotel to stay in. After a discussion with his colleague, another room suddenly became available. This room, room 308, was marginally better. Thankfully it was a lot quieter and the windows didn't look like they were about to fall apart. However this room also had it's problems. The room had a tiled floor, half of which were cracked and broken making it quite dangerous to walk on. The paint was peeling off the wall and the ceiling. It rained our first night and we got back to the hotel about 10pm to find it was the only building in the street to have lost power. We were given a tiny candle by the front desk to find our way up six flights of stairs and find our room. Any elderly guests or any who had difficultly walking would have found this extremely difficult. Thankfully the power came back on after a while.You could hear everything that went on in the hotel during the night. We were kept awake by noisy guests going back to their room, people shouting and loud music in the street. At about 7am the air conditioning unit in the building next door came on, waking us up.There was no hot water from either the tap or the shower and the shower door didn't close properly so the bathroom was covered in water.We then got a phone call from reception asking us when we would be leaving our room as we were being moved to another room as this one needed 'urgent repairs'. I'm not surprised.We were given another room, room 330, that was a slight improvement. Still not the 3 stars the hotel claims to be, but adequate. While the room was very quiet during the day, there must have been a bar nearby as there was a lot of noise coming from outside during the night. We were kept awake until about 4am, so another night with barely any sleep. And this was room was supposed to be a quiet room. The bed was also so creaky that you couldn't move without making a noise.The Royal Victoria Hotel is by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. How they can charge customers money to stay in those rooms is disgusting. The whole hotel needs completely renovating and I would advise anyone looking to stay in Pisa to go elsewhere.",-1,1,0.491226438
64618998,"I booked this hotel for my mother and son as an overnight stop on the way from Pisa airport to north Tuscany. We were attracted by the location and the idea of a glamorous &quot;Grand Tour&quot; style hotel. What a mistake. My son was 3 years old and my mother in her mid 60s. We booked 2 rooms with shared bath, but what they neglected to tell us was that the shared bath was 2 floors away! Our room was on the third floor and the &quot;bathroom&quot; on the fifth! In addition, their idea of shared &quot;bath&quot; was shower only - not ideal with a toddler. Eventually, they agreed to move us to a room with a shower and provided me with a baby bath - not ideal, but it worked. I had to argue very strongly to achieve this, and the attitude was that I was trying to get a free upgrade to a better room. Actually, all I wanted to do was bath my son after a long trip. I was left quite angry and disappointed by the whole experience. The facilities of the room are generally of poor quality, with antiquainted locks on the doors and windows that don't shut properly - we overlooked the back of a very noisy bar, which as you can imagine was a fantastic way to experience Pisa. Some people might think this is &quot;quaint&quot;, but not me. Further, the floors being tiled throughout means that any noise in the hallway (it is a big busy hotel) is amplified significantly and echoes around. Oh, and parking your car will cost you 20 euros - or you could drive 250 metres down the street and get free overnight parking in a public car park in a little square.On the plus side, the breakfast was ok, continental style - not much you can mess up there!

But about 10 pm, the youth of Pisa began gathering along the embankment, sitting on the ledge -- and talking and laughing well past 3 in the morning.  Motor scooters zoomed by.  Lots of noise.  We couldn't turn on our AC without calling the front desk for someone to come up with a remote which they would NOT leave in the room, so we didn't bother calling and slept -- or tried to sleep -- with the window open.  They offered us a &quot;free&quot; breakfast (which should have been included in the cost -- I guess you have to ask when you make reservations).  I would not return.

It just feels a little tired and worn - perhaps that's only to be expected in such an old building. The stairways are quite grand, and I suppose the rustic rooms have their charm, but it felt more like staying in a hostel than a hotel. Certainly it's quite expensive given the level of accommodation.As my brother noted below, his room had bedbugs, which, to be fair to the owners, has now been rectified (in room 206 at least- don't know about others). It's to the credit of the hotel that they've put right something which went wrong, although I can't help feeling it could have been dealt with better at the time of the problem.I haven't stayed anywhere else in Pisa so can't really say if the Royal Victoria is any better or worse than other hotels in the area, although I wouldn't stay here again that's for sure.",-1,0,0.598178211

The floors were bare, cold and we think perhaps just concrete--hard to tell. The stairwells clearly used to have carpet, but now are simply painted to look like carpet.   As to the advertised &quot;Parking&quot;-- this cost 20 euros/day, which would be fine, but to get to their &quot;garage&quot; you had to navigate a series of increasingly smaller streets such that anything larger than a golf cart would need 3-point turns on every corner--I could literally read the menu on the restaurant table we drove pastâ¦Basically, this place was probably nice around 1910 or soâ¦but hasn't been updated at all.

On entering the hotel the first thing that struck me was, there is faded elegance, and then there is this place. The junior suite, room 202, was even worse. It was described as having a seating area, yes, a very worn couch and chair, a mini bar, yes, on the floor and empty, and air conditioning.....er a fan!

To top it off, the toilet wouldn't flush everything away, if you know what I mean. I could go on...the cracks in the ceiling, the cracks in the wall. It was obvious that in it's day, it was a beautiful hotel, but those days were far behind it. After brooding for a while I approached the duty manager who offered me a second fan for the room. At that stage I had a total humour failure....can't think why. After a &quot;discussion&quot;, he managed to find us another room, 307. I have to say that it was much better. It had been tastefully decorated although it still had the 1970s bathroom, but best of all, an air con unit by the window. It was lovely and cool. We decided to shower, ugh, change, and go out for our final dinner. At that point the air con stopped working.  Just as well that I had regained my sense of humour. On our way out to dinner, I handed in our room key and asked the manager to please sort out the air con. A short ten minute walk took us to the tower where we found a nice but rather touristy restaurant to have our final meal. On returning to the hotel, my wife was correct in her ascertain that the air con would not be working. We spent the night laying on the bed covered in damp towels with a cooling fan closely related to Concord, blowing hot air over us. Needless to say, we didn't get much sleep so up early and down to breakfast at 7.15am. Grand Piano in the corner, yet cafeteria wooden chairs with red plastic seats. I shall say nothing about the breakfast except it was totally in keeping with our experience of the place. Having negotiated  a &quot;small&quot; reduction in our bill, we left very disappointed. I realise that this is a long review, but sometimes a few sentences don't convey the whole picture. I have stayed in hotels of various standards during my travels, but this was without doubt, the worst bearing in mind, what it purports to be. NEVER EVER again.",-1,4,0.529805556

29520051,"Just returned from a lovely weekend in Pisa - perfect weather, great food, successful family mini-break.... only negative was the niggling feeling of disappointment with the hotel.  I'd booked on the strength of positive TripAdvisor reviews but with hindsight wish I hadn't foolishly ignored the negative ones!  On the plus side, staff were friendly enough, location was good in terms of walking distance to sights but away from most touristy area, beds were comfy (we like them firm), the roof terrace was very sweet and we really liked the shabby chic charm of the interior (didn't mind the dated and basic bathroom - part of the feel of it).  But unfortunately have to totally agree with the previous reviewer on two VERY IMPORTANT points: the breakfast was actually rubbish, in my opinion - am genuinely flabbergasted that some previous reviewers have rated it good/excellent!  The bread rolls were stale, cheese was of the plastic pre-sliced variety, most of the offerings were cheap cakes and biscuits individually packaged in plastic and - cardinal sin in my book - the 'juice' was actually high-sugar orange squash: yuk.  I don't expect freshly squeezed OJ of a morning, but even pure juice from concentrate is not exactly expensive or hard to find.  The only enjoyable bits were the croissants (though would have preferred without sugary coating) and the coffee.  Secondly - aargh, the nocturnal noise!!!  I have nothing against people having fun of an evening, but when they are caterwauling past your window at 4am it does start to grate a little.  Added to this was the overwhelming noise of traffic rushing past, the frequent emergency sirens, the loud music from Cafe Bazeel on the corner, the DJ shouting his head off, smashing bottles, etc. etc.  The kids didn't seem affected by it but my husband and I were tossing and turning till 5am on Saturday night and at least 2am on Sunday - not a great way to set you up for a relaxing stroll the following day (or a 7am wake-up call from two boisterous children).  Our room (Junior Suite, with extra bed and cot) was #102, so maybe the fact that we were on the first floor made it worse, but with no sound-proofing or double glazing and ill-fitting balcony doors the windows may as well have been wide open.  Would probably not visit again, but if for some reason we absolutely had to I would definitely specify a room facing the opposite direction (+ to be honest the 'river view' is not all that).  Also, definitely WAY overpriced.  However, Pisa is a lovely city with a very low-key, relaxing atmosphere and a great maze of back streets for exploring - would really recommend it for a family weekend break.  (Oh, and hopping on the bus to Marina di Pisa for a few hours is definitely worth it if you have small kids and the sun is shining!)",-1,8,0.49344289

We had worked out that this hotel was going to be basic but we were in for a terrible shock!The communal areas and corridors are all kept very pleasant indeed as shown on the pictures of the hotel. What the pictures fail to show is exactly how basic this hotel really is when it comes to your room! The closest I can get to describing the room is Butlins holiday camp,old wooden beds, old soft mattresses,old furniture, even  the switches on the bedside table were ancient.It felt like we were in a prison cell once in the room. We could not have stayed for more than one night.On a positive note the location is excellent for all the sights of Pisa and very easy to get to from the station and to the airport by bus.

I realised with horror a month later that I had made this mistake, and wrote an email asking the hotel to show understanding and to allow me to move the booking to the correct date. The reply was very unfortunate, basically 'computer says no'. The booking is non-refundable, so that's my hard earned cash gone up in smoke. I wrote pleading for a bit more understanding, offering to pay the difference in price for a July rate (â¬30 more, fair enough) not at all sure I actually wanted to stay in this place as a result of their initial response, and got a similarly curt response saying no.

Therefore, we did not get much sleep. While the room was clean, there was paint peeling off the walls and the bathroom looked like it was over 50 years old. But the terrace bar is nice and breakfast was a good selection of fresh fruit, yogurts and breads. But for the price, the hotel is not worth it.

We were pleasantly surprised when we first entered the room as all windows were opened.

31821937,"We stayed here for 3 nights in May and have mixed opinions on this hotel. On the plus side, on arriving at Pisa airport we cleared customs in a matter of seconds then jumped straight into a cab which took barely 5 mins. to reach the hotel. It cost â¬8.Unfortunately the hotel would not let us check in until 1pm so we had to dump our cases and then wait.When we were given our room, I was extremely disappointed. We had booked a triple room and paid significantly extra for it but essentially it was a standard double with a fold-up bed in the corner, so extremely squashed - and not at all like the photos of spacious rooms on either the hotel website or the leaflets they had at hotel reception.Worse, was that we were on a first floor overlooking a lightwell. It was so, so dark - you needed all the lights on in the room even in the middle of the day. Strangely there was no ceiling light, just one bedside lamp and a free-standing light next to the wardrobe (whose door would not close so we had to prop it shut with a suitcase to stop it from swinging open).I know you do not go to Pisa to spend huge amounts of time in hotel rooms but we were travelling with a young child so inevitable we would have to go back to the room for rests. It was all just small, cramped and very very dark.Pisa is divided by the river Arno (hotel is very close to it) with the leaning tower area about a 15 walk away to the north and the train station a 15 walk to the south. We went on 2 day trips by train - to Florence which was an hour away and cost about â¬11 return each and then also to Lucca, â¬5 return and which took about 25 mins. Both highly recommended.

We walked to this location with a detailed map and it took 20 minutes from the train station (there is a way to get out of the train station that takes 5-10 minutes but we didn't know about it). Once we got there, we rang the bell and the owner came out and told us that we were inconveniencing him - which we were but we were trying to pay for another night to counter this inconvenience. He let us sit in a tiny hall way (probably 4ft wide and 12ft long) until the sun came up, which was nice of him but was a weird encounter because there isn't a reception area at all. He told us we couldn't lie on the floor because we would scare the other guests (understandably) but he said we had to be super super quiet. He also said that because he was doing this, we &quot;better give him a good review...a REALLY REALLY good review&quot;. This is a house with two rooms that have as many beds that can possibly fit. We left this house from 8am to the time of check in  (2pm). Once we did check in, we were extremely disappointed.

Which doesn't sound so bad except that is was a single sized bed and impossible to accommodate two people.Turns out he told everyone this and so everyone was sleeping two to a bed except for one man who lived there as his home. The place reeked and was definitely neglected. The bathroom was the worst of it. There wasn't any toilette paper for our entire stay, the shower has mold caked along the edges, the doors to the shower did not close which caused a huge puddle on the bathroom floor, the hot water lasted for half of one persons shower, AND when he asked for a towel he said he would give it to us for free BUT, once again, he asked us to share because it was easiest.

61309953,"Oh dear. I have never written a review before, but I just had to do this one! When I was told this was 4 star hotel, I did not expect what we actually saw. I went with a friend for leisure and she also had to work over the weekend (on the internet). Overall, the service was appalling and the staff very unhelpful. Our experience borders on the comical.1.  Location - Point 1: First of all, the hotel is on a big main road 3 km of Pisa and the location is rather noisy and dirty, overlooking some auto repairs shops and warehouses. You have to take transport to get anywhere - a local bus or a taxi to the centre (taxi costs 12 Euro).2. Staffâs lack helpfulness â Example 1: We arrived Friday night and were given a plastic key card to our room, which we quickly found out did not work. Upon going downstairs the reception staff told us â âwe know it does not work, you need the Master key, the card is for electricity onlyâ. Any reason they did not give this to us straight away?3. The room: The room (we had a twin) was rather small (2 single beds, 2 inches away from each other) and 1 meter of space either side of the bed, with a TV, a small window, which meant that the room was very dark. It was tidy but not fantastically clean. The bathroom was nice and clean though, but could have benefitted from some space (other than minimal sink space) to put toiletries on. Everything else was very basic and rather Spartan.4. Air-con: When we got in was very hot and the air-con did not seem to be working. I called reception and was told - &quot;we know, it does not work in the entire hotel, we do not have the licence to operate the air-con yet, we are waiting&quot;. The window opens a small crack only - so not fantastic for temperature regulation!5. Wi-Fi: The hotel advertises free Wi-Fi. It is simply a lie. There is no Wi-Fi in the hotel and when my friend was no able to connect on her own, the staff were entirely unhelpful and said they did not know how my friend could log on and they would need to speak to a technical (âwho might be in later onâ), but kept insisting that they had Wi-Fi everywhere (and kept repeating âitâs free!â), but in fact the only way to get online was a single computer in the corner by the lifts. My friend was directed to use the computer in the corner, and once she has waited her turn and tried to log on, she found out that she needed log in details and password. She went back to the staff and they said âwe know, we can print that for youâ. Again â why did they not do that straight away? In the meantime my friend lost her place in the queue for the computer and had to wait to use it again.6. Food &amp; Drink: Food is another matter. Breakfast was terrible. I found out that they were serving pineapple rings which were clearly off, and I narrowly avoided eating, whilst my friend had some bad eggs and was sick for the next 24 hours. The coffee (in the metal jugs in the buffet) was cold and we asked a waitress to bring some hot coffee, she took so long making it and chatting with her colleagues on the way back that it was cold again by the time she had brought it! The next day we made sure we had food elsewhere.7. Location  - Point 2/Staffâs lack helpfulness â Example 2: On Saturday night we were out in central Pisa and at around midnight tried to get a taxi to go back to the hotel. With no taxis in the street and having waited 45 minutes at the taxi stand at the train station at Pisa Central, we called the hotel to call a taxi for us, who said they âwould try, but could not promise anythingâ. 10 minutes later they had not ordered anything and had no other ideas as to how we could get back to their hotel. In the end we were rescued by a fellow person waiting in line, who miraculously found out a taxi number and called a number of taxis to the stand.8. Staffâs lack helpfulness â Example 3: Upon arrival back at the hotel after the taxi palaver, we were given just the plastic key card to our door again (we left all keys in the hotel as not to accidentally lose them), and when we said it does not work and we that need the Master key, the person at the desk started grumbling to himself (presumably that we dared ask for it straight away) and only grudgingly gave it to us.9. Staffâs lack helpfulness â Example 4: This last one is pure comedy (but not funny at the time) â on Sunday morning there was a full-on thunderstorm. My friend wanted to buy cigarettes and after 10 minutes of trying to find out from staff where to get them, they reluctantly gave her detailed directions to the store nearby and pointed her to it (in the pouring rain, no umbrella). When she got to the store, it was shut. Once back in the hotel, my friend asked the staff â did you know it was shut before I went? And, very helpfully the staff replied â yes, youâve guessed it â âwe knewâ.OVERALL IMPRESSION:It is a good hotel for a 2 star hotel. Under no circumstances is this a 4 star hotel, there is no air-con, no wi-fi (contrary to advertisement), unhelpful staff, questionable food and not a great location. Definitely not a place for a business traveller due to Wi-Fi problems. Unfortunately due to the weather we were unable to test the pool, so I will say nothing about that. If you go with low expectations, youâll probably be fine, but do not expect a comfortable or luxurious stay.",-1,17,0.507199751

16563610,"This property was recommended by the Airport Concierge in Pisa. The only reason it was worth it is because it was only for one night before we flew out. First of all it is located in a place where there is nothing....not even a restaurant to go to or market to pick up a couple of things. It is 15 Euros ($23.00) from the airport &amp; 17 Euros ($26.00) into the city center where the restaurants are. There was constuction  untill about 7pm, construction which made out entire room vibrate. Ther TV ammenitiy &amp; options did not work, the AC did not work. I tried to call the front desk for guidance but was met with curt service.....at one point the Gentleman at the front desk just said &quot; If it does not work that is to bad&quot;. So........I went down to the lobby to try get some answers. Let me premace this by saying that I have worked in upscale hotels for over 12 years, so I know how things work (or don't work). There was a red haired gentleman at the front desk who was clearly bothered by the fact that I needed anything at all, or by the fact that I was American. I hate to assume that but....I don't know, he gave me the impression that he was above hleping me. I spoke to him of our concerns &amp; he basically did nothing but look at me like I was crazy, shrug his shoulders. I am assuming that this is the same person who I spoke to on the phone. Maybe he should not be in customer service at all. I spoke then to someone else who was attentive enough, but we never did hear ANYTHING from ANYBODY about resolving ANY of the issues......not one peep. We eventually found cafe and dinned on Pannini &amp; Coca Cola, which was fine for one night. There is no store at the Hotel for little things such as drinks, so you have to pay high prices at the bar for a soda ect.......We spent the evening watching Italian MTV (which was actually pretty entertaining), and nibbling on our dry Pannini. The next monring we checked out at about 5am. The Gentleman at the desk on this morning (the morning of the May 29th, 5am), was a breath of fresh air &amp; was the epidemy of great customer service. I would hire him in a heart beat! We was gracious and appologetic, and even made us a coffee before we got into our taxi. We asked to speak with a manager but I suppose it was to early. I left a detailed note.........no one ever got back to me about anything........again.....So, never again will we stay here, or recommend it, although we travel in Italy quite often, as do many of our friends &amp; familly, and always fly in and out of Pisa.I hate writing bad reviews....I really do....but for the price we paid (almost $200.00), it was not worth even half that.Except for the lovley man working the greaveyard shift of course......",-1,1,0.446894587

78195964,"Arrived late in the evening and we had one man on the desk trying to manage all check -ins (there was a coach party in front of us who had been re allocated this hotel after a flight cancellation).  Had a booking code handy and passports.  He didn't bother looking at our details and tried to allocate one room for all four of us.  It was only when my husband protested and said that we were not part of the coach party that he stopped and listened.  We then had our passports taken off us and were told we couldn't have them back until the next day.  We asked for adjoining rooms (as we had two young children) - we didn't get them.  We had to remake the kid's beds and they were the wrong configuration.  There were no tea and coffee making facilities and the (very basic) shower left alot to be desired - it had a tendency to switch from very icy-cold to burning hot every few seconds.The daytime reception manager (he had slightly ginger hair) was much better and more helpful.The breakfast room - reasonable food - continental with some hot (scrambled eggs/bacon).  However we suffered the wrath of one or two surly members of staff.  We asked for a CaffeLatte (which they especially made using Espresso coffee with hot milk and is served in a glass).  When we asked one of the waitresses, in her best English, she said '  there's the cafe and there's the latte - do it yourself!' although she seemed happy to help fellow Italians with the same request.  The pool was good, kids loved that.  Not enough suitable seating/beds, but we managed.  No obvious refreshment/snack service and it was clear that it was too much of an inconvience for one of the waitresses to deliver food - despite ordering from a very cheerful (different) waitress.The location, in terms of the airport, is ideal.  It's about a ten minute journey - if that.  There is only an industrial estate around the hotel.  The bus stop - a No. 5 - will take you to the central train station for only one euro (if you buy your tickets in advance from a shop) or one euro fifty if you buy from the bus driver.

One week prior to the date of my reservation, I was rushed to the hospital for an emergency medical condition and had to postpone my trip.  Immediately upon my release from the hospital, even though I was in pain and not getting around too well, I still managed to email them to cancel my reservation a couple of *hours* after their 7-day cancellation deadline.  I offered to send them my medical documentation.  As always the staff were responsive and assured me that my reservation had been cancelled.  However, a few weeks later I found that I had been charged on my credit card *in full*.  This speaks volumes about their priorities--they would rather take my money at a time that I was incapacitated than have me as a happy customer who will stay with them when I get well and recommend them to others.  I am well now and planning my rescheduled trip but you can be sure that I won't be staying there!!!  Overall I feel betrayed and cheated.

Everything about it was average and nothing was great (except the location). The rooms were a tribute to the 70's and weren't particularly clean. The air-con didn't work and the staff weren't able to fix it - consequently it was so hot that neither of us slept. The staff weren't rude it's just that they weren't very friendly...we didn't see any of them smile at least anyway. The breakfast was a no-frills glass of orange squash and a croissant.We stayed overnight because we were catching a plane home in the morning from the airport but I wouldn't really recommend Pisa as anything more than a day trip to see the Tower and Duomo - which are definately sights worth seeing.

He's not overweight just a little tall, typical Australian male. My partner had to literally turn sideways to enter the shower to fit through the tiny screen shower doors and then he could not bend down to wash his feet. He dropped the soap and had to come out of the shower to be able to reach in and pick it up and then re enter the shower again. It was hilarious! It wasn't overly clean and it really does pay to get there early, book the earlier flight to get a better and higher room or the noise from the road will keep you too alert day and night. There is strangely cable tv with one English channel. It is a very dated and sadly a little bit 'grotty' but then again we didn't see alot better in Pisa. If we paid only 75 euros like some other people did who reviewed this hotel we would have felt that was fair but 100 euros was a bit rich.

Great, thanks. The floor of the room (number 101, figures) was so dusty, the whole of the side of my suitcase was covered in it when I packed up to leave.

597063006,"Booked a 1 Night Stay due to an early departure flight. Initially happy with our funky room decor, large comfy bed, impressed with the bathroom &amp; shower etc. After returning from a longish very hot walk into central Pisa &amp; back we dined in the hotel's restaurant, staff friendly, food average/ok, prices steep for what you get ! Got to bed for 10pm fully expecting to easily fall asleep after a very busy day, evening meal etc. but we were so very very wrong ! Room 240 AVOID ! Air Conditioning Only just about took the room temp down to bearable, however the noise from the Air Con was unbearable - some noise we expected but every few minutes the Unit would give out a loud almost growling sound which lasted a few seconds, this blew any chance we &quot;never&quot; had of &quot;any&quot; sleep. Ok, let's switch the Air Con OFF, which we did only for the room to quickly take on the feel of a Sauna, to add to our pain the growling noise continued every few minutes. Aghh Frustration ! We rang Reception, politely explained our problem, requested a move to another room, and as many Other Guests on Trip Advisor appear to have experienced, we were told &quot;No Hotel Full&quot; hmm on a Thursday night ?? The night-shift Receptionist offered to provide a Fan for our room, we accepted. So now we had the noise of the Air Con, the loud annoying Growling and the Mobile Fan noise - bizarrely though the noise from the Mobile Fan seemed to disguise the other noises and we finally &quot;passed out tired&quot; somewhere after 12am, only to be up again at 4am to check-out, so we can't comment on breakfast. We'd already informed the Receptionist we weren't prepared to Pay for our semi-sleepless night, which we reminded her of on check-out, we were informed a note had been placed on our account, but we couldn't be reimbursed because we'd pre-paid through Booking.com so would have to go through them. Back in the UK we contacted the hotel &amp; booking.com - to cut a long story short, after the hotel acknowledged our emails and displeasure we were informed we would hear from the Hotel Manager (still waiting), booking.com also waited to hear from the Hotel Manager which never happened for them either. Please Note: Booking.com Customer Services were absolutely excellent and despite not hearing from the Hotel Manager themselves booking.com offered to give us a Full Refund, which we gratefully accepted. To summarise - Would We use this Hotel Again? Answer: No we'd rather sleep on the airport floor ! We will be visiting Tuscany often and initially thought we'd found a &quot;great little find&quot; to use each time an early flight beckoned - we informed other Tuscany travelling Friends of our &quot;Great Find&quot; which they planned to use also - however since our experience / feedback we'll never use this hotel again and have informed Others to avoid avoid avoid !!! ...

We had stayed in a different hotel the previous days-the Repubblica was full and could not accomodate us.I was immediately unimpressed.  The lobby is lovely but our room wasn't ready.  The clerk said 1/2 hour and proceeded to forget about us.  We inquired 45 minutes later and she was shocked we were still there!  The room was just average and had seen lots of wear and tear. The cable T.V. wasn't functioning and the cord had been pulled out of the back. My husband reattached and we had some basic channels.  No movies on demand.  When I inquired the clerk gave a curt, &quot;No movies, &quot; and hung up on me.  We walked across the street and found a basic cafeteria for pizza and salads.  Nothing else was around.  The hotel restaurant is very pricey-not family friendly.  We took a cab to the city center for about $10.00 to have dinner and walk the Piazza one last time. The hotel did a nice job calling a cab in the evening and putting in an order for a cab in the morning at 4:00a.m.They didn't even ask if we enjoyed our stay.  Go to the Hotel Terminus.

477534787,"We read many reviews before booking our stay and thought that some people were just unhappy as a one off, or complained about things for the sake of it.... we were wrong.Cost - The cost of our stay considering the lack of hotel facilities available, making it nothing more than a room with nothing to do anywhere nearby.The drinks and food in the on site restaurant were expensive, which you would think that given how much you pay for staying there, that you would get some sort of benefit from the hotel.Minibar - This consists of two bottles of still water and two bottles of fizzy water, which was only topped up if your fridge was empty we made the mistake of having some other bottles in there and although the room was cleaned, the minibar was not refreshed, although i'm not sure how four bottles of water can be classed as a minbar.Double Bed - This double bed consists of two twins pushed together and held that way by the bed linen, which is always hidden in photos showing the rooms 'double bed'Sound Proof Room - We were blessed with the scenic view showing the restaurant across the road 'old wild west' and also the non-stop nightly italian emergency service whizzing endlessly up and down the road, and when that wasn't happening, we had workmen digging up the road outside the room until 3am. Air Conditioning - The hotel does not supply cold air conditioning, only hot as it's law that it can't be on in certain months (but no law about workmen disrupting holiday makers, digging up roads outside the hotel till 3am??)No fan or anything is supplied to help with the heat issue, just sweat away in your bed, it's not like you'll sleep anyway with the emergency services or workmen outside.Dining - The only restaurant nearby is 'old wild west' which is ok for one or two nights, but we were there for 6, so dining was not possible locally as the on site restaurant should have been offering loans to pay for their meal prices.Television - The flat screen tv is fixed onto a pallet which is attached to the wall, i'm not sure what decor this is supposed to be, but it just looked cheap if anything.Also if you are english, the only channels for you are NEWS, so you can enjoy non-stop coverage of donald trump or north korea until you become brain dead.American Bar - In the lift / elevator you will see a sign stating 'American Bar', do not be misled, there is nothing American about any part of the hotel or the restaurant, even the bar staff had no idea what i was asking about when i enquired about it.POSITIVE POINT - SHOWER - Excellent water pressure and hot as you likeToilet - No idea who designed the hotels plumbing but it failed to flush even the simplest of toilet usages.No Balcony / Seating - The ONLY place to sit at this hotel is outside the main doors, two single metal chairs where people smoke. There is not garden or lounge area to relax, it's either your room, or go out somewhere.Getting Around - We visited Pisa tower / Cathedral etc, it was quite easy to find, and we always walked there as it was only 25 mins and the weather was nice BUT i would say that this can all be seen in a couple of days at most, other than that you will spend most of your time learning about what Donald Trump is upto on the news in your room.Staff - Reception staff were always helpful and spoke clear english. WI FI - Oh well i can finally agree now we have experienced the endless logging in you have to do every time the wi fi dropped out.

When we asked the receptionist about this, her attitude was a shrug of the shoulders and basically tough luck - not my problem.  There were also no transfers on the Sunday back to the airport, so we had to stump up â¬25 in total for what we were led to believe were transfers included in the booking price.  If you are staying at this hotel, please confirm any transfers first.  Also as there were no transfers available we would have to have got a taxi into town as well - again something which was apparently part of the deal on their website.I would agree with some of the other reviews concerning the dining arrangements.  There are no &quot;bar meals&quot; at this hotel, we were pointed in the direction of a pizzeria at the end of the road as we could not face the over-blown restaurant menu.Breakfast was adequate, but did not befit a supposedly four star hotel.The rooms were adequate, a bit on the small side, but nothing special.This is not a four star hotel - there is no tea/coffee/water in the room, no pool or leisure facilities.

134331464,"I can categorically say that this has been my worst hotel experience yet. I have never been treated with so much disrespect by a hotel owner in my life. I felt intimidated, threatened and humiliated by his aggressive, bullying behaviour.This happened because I had had a friend in my room for a few hours.  I understand I had only paid for a single room but my friend was only staying temporarily and then leaving. I was walking my friend down to the exit at about midnight when the owner appeared. He looked enraged and started yelling at me in the hallway where all of the other guests could hear.

My friend was only there for a few hours I said, he was going home, he was not staying overnight.But the owner did not listen. He continued yelling at me like I was a dog. I  wanted to cry. I have never been so embarrassed in my life.He made my friend give his ID card and photocopied it, as if he was some sort of criminal.

85996291,"Let me say that I will criticize this guy (Francesco's) operation here in a review rather than lambasting him on the forums, although I'd have perfect cause to do so on the Pisa and Florence forums.We pretty much had booking problems from day one. I had booked two rooms with ensuite facilities in May 2010 after looking at the airportpisarooms website. I then booked the rooms through hostel bookers. Turns out he really doesn't have two ensuite rooms available, and has listed his rooms incorrectly on hostel bookers. Ultimately we were given the switch to another property, (an apartment,) with two bedrooms and a shared bath.This facility is near the Cisanello hospital in Pisa, and transportation connections are not the best. There is a bus stop a few blocks away, but if you need to get to the airport, it means taking the bus downtown, then transferring to another bus. As we had 5 people in our party, it meant two trips from the hostel to the apartment, which Francesco offered.  We were given basic instructions to leave the keys inside the apartment, and as we had an early flight the next morning, he would make the first run to the airport (with 3 of us) at 4:50 am, then return for the other two in our group.Guess what: by 5:30 am, there was no Francesco, and the keys were locked in the apartment as requested, no telephone anywhere, and , a torrential downpour as well.I walked to the hospital and half communicated with a security guard as to our need for a phone call to the taxi company. Evidently the taxi company doesn't answer phones that early in the morning, but the guard kept trying, and we were eventually able to secure two cabs to move us to the airport for our flights.The apartment itself was nothing to write home about, and one or more bathroom fixtures need repairs as there was water all over the floor before any of us used it.The lighting in this place gives new meaning to the word dreary. The beds were passable.Lessons learned: be very wary when dealing with this guy (Francesco) and airport pisa rooms. If you get stuck way out in the boonies as we did, I'd suggest ordering up cabs the night before you leave, whether they be for an airport run, or a train station run. Do not leave a set of keys in the apartment until after your transport arrives.To say we were on pins and needles would be an understatement. I would never book again with this guy and his operation in a million years.Also, no restaurants open on a Sunday night anywhere near this place.",-1,4,0.434981061

It is great to stay there if you need to catch the morning flight or arrive late at night (it is literally 2min from the airport). To stay there for more than 1 night would not be the best choice. The Via dell'Aeroporto has a lot of B&amp;B's and many of then offer better facilities at a lower price.The main city center is at a good walking distance (approx 40min from leaning tower). There is a supermarket nearby however as there is no kitchen there is not a lot premade meals you can buy. Luckily Italian restaurants have great food for reasonable prices.The bathroom is ok with a basic shower and the room had just a simple bed (mattress with springs) with a closet and a ridiculously small tv.

Most of the comments on their guest book were positive, including some that raved about the breakfast.  The breakfast however just consisted of juice, coffee and pre-packaged sweet items.  I also had to remove the blanket on my bed as it was slightly stained and had what looked like animal hairs.  I don't think this was value for money for 60 euros.",-1,0,0.480681818

We were asked to come back at 9pm, given a city map and directions to a good pizza place (which I must say was excellent).  We arrived back to a room for 4 with a portable bed in it for my mother. The room was very clean and infact had a new bathroom.  This was probably the worse night sleep of my life, the problem was not that it is on a main road but that the planes are taking off right over head. So it was not only loud but you felt the rumble go through your body. We paid 180 Euro (after I negotiated for the room error) for 2 nights so it was a cheap option but I would never ever stay there again.",-1,0,0.4854329

The room was ok , no wardrobe to hang any clothes just a coat rack .

The reviews from before we arrived they said to 'have problems with the bathrooms' and the reviews from after we were there, they were having 'problems with the bathrooms'. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! How can this place still be open? They lure people to pay more and then install them in another less-rated hotel, without a discount.

She was there in 20.. We read all the reviews in their guestbook, which was SO positive, so we got excited to stay there. When she finally came, she said there was something wrong with the bathrooms, so she got us in at 'their' other hotel. Clearly not their hotel! Crap as hell! Hotel Terranova.

She didn't show up at her appointed time to check me in and then after I found a phone from a business woman down the street, the owner said she be there in 5 minutes, she finally showed up an hour late, no apology. It was getting dark and cold and I wasn't sure if I had a place to sleep or not - not a great feeling when you have traveled all day and you don't know the town well. She didn't tell about the extra 2 euro tax and there is no usage of the kitchen - the breakfast is a joke. She also pressured me to stay longer and pay in advance without even seeing the room. You can't lock your things there and the location is bleak and is a longer walk than other places to the attractions of Pisa. They boast some award, but that was long ago and the owner is not interested in her business at all. DON'T GO THERE, even if it is cheap.

Rooms have no AC, so during summer nights it is hot and humid. When booking on website it says 4 singel beds room, but actually 1 room with double bed and bedbunk, so two persons have to share a bed. Internet is not always working properly. When arriving at b&amp;b there is no one there and you are supposed to call the lady who will be there in 5 (read 10-15min). Keys lay outside in the window, so everyone can enter the house and steal the post, tv etc which is just laying at the desk. Shared bathrooms are ok to real bad. With only one roll of toiletpaper a day.Conclusion: a 20â¬ low budget B&amp;B without a (real) breakfast.

When we arrived at the B&amp;B around 2pm and there seemed to be no one at the hostel as all the curtains were shut and we could not figure out how to open the gate to get to the front door. We rang the number from our booking details and were told how to open the gate and that the keys for the front door and our room were sitting on a windowsill next to the door. We let ourselves in and then opened up our room. To our surprise we found there was only beds for 4 people - one double bed and a bunkbed. We had booked and paid a deposit for a room for 6 people on hostelbooker.com so we informed the owner who we still had on the phone and she assured us that they would bring us more beds. So we settled into the room and had our lunch in the B&amp;B's garden that we could walk out into from the french doors in our room. We then head out to explore Pisa as it was our only day in the city. We returned to the B&amp;B later that night around 10.45pm. We found that no extra beds had been provided and there were no staff to be found so we had a rather uncomfortable night sleep with 3 people sharing a double bed and 3 people in the tiny bunkbed. There was no air con or fan (which we had in all the other similarly priced accommodation we stayed in on our trip) so we had to have the windows wide open all night - which also meant we had very little sleep because it was the night Italy won the semi final of Euro 2012 and the celebratory car horn sounding didn't stop until 2am (of course the noise was not something the B&amp;B can be blamed for but we could not have shut the windows without us all overheating). The other problem that night was that one of my friends sleeping the in double bed woke in the night to find water from the ceiling leaking on to her. We finally saw a member of staff the next morning at breakfast. Breakfast was really not substantial. It consisted of some tiny pieces of toast, which was so hard and crunchy it was barely edible, some jam and a basket of biscuits. When it came to checking out we were not happy and wanted to complain. The man who served breakfast said the owner wasn't there and we would have to ring her. We tried ringing 5 times over about half an hour but she did not answer the phone and we eventually had to leave to get our train.So all in all rather a disappointing B&amp;B. It is a shame because it has the potential to be a really nice little place with the lovely garden out the back and the nice exposed beams in the rooms. The ensuite bathroom in our room was also very nice but didn't really make up for the total lack of service we received and the rather cramped conditions of 6 people sharing a 4 bed room.",-1,0,0.502708333

35139017,"The process of checking in wasn't what I would normally expect - upon booking, Michele emailed to say he could pick me up from the airport for a pretty reasonable price which was kind of him, however, I already had plans to make my own way to the hostel. Once in Pisa, finding the place was pretty difficult - it isn't well sign posted at all and is on a very dingy street so you kind of don't believe you're in the right place until you scrutinize the street numbers. There seemed to be little or no flexibility on when to check in - I was five or ten minutes later than my latest expected arrival time (total guesswork on how long the baggage reclaim and taxi would take) and Michele was annoyed. I'm not sure if that's just a cultural difference and the Italians agree a definitive check in time in advance, or if it's just Michele who likes military precision! I personally think a guest should be able to check in when they're good and ready. Once checked in, Michele asked when I wanted breakfast the next morning but I didn't think this was on my hostelbookers booking so I said I would pass. Beware that it is indeed an extra charge on top of what is already a pretty expensive hostel booking so I was glad I opted out. Michele made out he was doing me a big favour by knocking the cost of breakfast off my final bill. Michele fished for the time I thought I would be leaving in the morning, which I thought was pretty unrelaxed.The room was pretty well equipped - it had air con, a flat screen tv, a double bed, towels, remote controls, some magazines on the bookshelf. It also had a laptop with internet that was slower than a week in jail so I abandoned trying to use it. The communal shower room was fine.Early the next morning, the street outside my room was very noisy and so I didn't sleep very well. After showering and packing up, coincidence or not, Michele was standing outside my room in the lobby at the time I said I thought I would be leaving, waiting with my bill. Again, I don't think this is normal practice for a guest house/hostel. Perhaps if I had withheld my expected check in and check out times, my experience would have been different... who knows.I have stayed in hostels in nicer cities (Tuscany included) for nearly a third of the price and so I don't think this hostel is good value for money at all. I would sooner spend 10-15 euros more for a proper hotel room with en-suite bathroom and breakfast included.",-1,1,0.490678494

He answered quite annoyed that we were late and that he would have informed the lady who manages the guest house to come to get us. She just leaned ouot of the window from the building across the street and told us to go there! The room was ok, the bathroom also but not as sparkling clean as it appears in the pictures.

To start with, when booking the room I marked that I wanted to check in at 9 pm and when we found the hostel (it's 2 min walk from the station) we found out that the owner had to drive from her own place somewhere else to complete the formalities. When I called her, she asked if I could wait until &quot;after dinner&quot; which finally meant another hour. Considering we had only one night in Pisa, this was nothing else than a theft of time. When the owner finally arrived, she showed me my 6-prs room.. In fact there were only four beds and one small pulled out of a wardrobe but it was rather for a child than for an adult. The lady told me that the double bed was for 3 persons (for God's sake, who sleeps with 3 people in one bed?!) so I'd rather say there were 4.5 beds. The bathrooms were dirty so I wouldn't encourage anyone to take a shower there. Luckily it was only one night and what we cared about was the location.. But I can't recommend this hostel to anyone.

It was a family room, not enough towels for people in the room, no duvet, sheets or covers to make up the sofa bed for our kid. When we went and asked at reception, he was completely clueless and had no idea where to go or what to do. He said it was his first day working there, he was left on his own and had only been shown the computer systems nothing else about the hotel! We could not believe it! When we arrive to book in we just assumed he was slightly odd as he struggled to book us in and had no idea what receipts to give us or anything. We ended up having to go get our own sheets, no other covers or duvets as nothing made up and he wanted us to get our own stuff as he said he didn`t have a clue what to give us.

The next day when we left there was a cleaner who was on a personal call complaining about how she had been left on her own and was shouting down the phone as we went past. She clearly saw us but did nothing to be professional. We then asked for the breakfast vouchers you can purchase for cheaper, she couldn`t find any and didn`t really know where they were, she then told us we only needed 1 voucher, even although we double checked with her! She advised us to explain at the restaurant why we had a evening meal voucher with us. When there at the till, they asked for our 2 vouchers as kids eat free, I explained we checked with the cleaner who confirmed we only needed 1. The guy said no problem he would fix it.

552758088,"December 2017 review for pub only A few friends and myself had booked a table for dinner for 5.30pm. This was one of the nights when it was so cold the roads and streets were like sheets of glass. Traffic was slower than usual so we arrived around 5.50pm looking forward to a lovely meal as it had been highly recommended. You can imagine our dismay when we arrived to be told that the chef had already left, thinking we were not going to show up. The barmaid did offer to bring in food from a nearby restaurant but we wanted to have a choice from a menu, so declined as we preferred to go to the restaurant ourseves. We'd already ordered drinks as soon as we got there, one being a bottle of wine. The barmaid offered to pour one glass and put the bottle back behind the bar for our return later to hear the entertainment that would be on. She asked which table we'd like to sit at and a reserved notice was placed on it for us.  On our return about an hour and a half later we expected to walk in and sit at the table we'd reserved earlier but 'Hey Ho' it was already taken by what turned out to be some of the other barmaid's pals. The barmaid did apologise saying she didn't think we were coming back - Utter Rubbish!. We moved to another table but had to move again as a large group beside us were using rather flowery language and we felt uncomfortable. Still not fully comfortable at this next table we decided to leave and go elsewhere. This was the first visit for all of us and you never get a second chance to make a first impression so we can honestly say that we would never return.",-1,1,0.42307619

The plastic panel on the side of the bath had massive cracks in it and was coming away from the bath itself. During the night I woke and reaIised what the ear plugs were for, to drown out the snoring from next door the walls on the ground floor are so thin. as  I checked out I mentioned the state of the bathroom to be told that had I mentioned it I would have been moved. I don't really think that's the point, they must have known about the damage to the bath and by putting me in there in the first place they showed a couldn't care less attitude for their customers.

Had a pre dinner drink in the bar which was lovely and pretty chic.When we were shown to out table it looked quite bare i.e. no tablecloth or mats and very thin paper serviettes that fell apart on touching. Due to the bare floors within the restaurant there was nothing to absorb the noise therefore it was very difficult to hear people at the table. Starters arrived almost immediately following our order however I had the haggis tower which was not very warm and the glayva sauce was not great.  I was more concerned how quickly the mussel's were served and again were not piping hot.  One member of our party is diagnosed with celiac and given this establishment I was surprised to find they did not particularly cater for this e.g. no bread available.  Offered them melon for a starter as they knew that would be ok!!!After approximately one hour our main course had not been served and this was questioned by one of our party.  the response was 'its the kitchen's fault'.Main courses eventually arrived and they were certainly nothing to write home about.  Steak was mediocre, steak burger was not eaten, pork stroganoff sauce was extremely gloopy and had been under a heat lamp causing a gel film around the edge of the plate, sea bass was beautiful but served on an abundance of noodles.Staff managed to serve the bottles of wine readily however one member of our party requested a whisky and dry and this took three attempt to achieve.The service was really poor however they appeared to be really short staffed.  Given how busy the place was they must be receiving a good income and could certainly afford to pay for more staff to meet the needs.This was my first visit here and I could not recommend this place nor would it ever be on my list to return.Felt really sorry for our family member who organised this and was paying for it.

The bed quality is poor. Very soft bedding.The worst part, the rooms have absolutely no ventilation except for a window which does not open fully. When we visited the hotel, it was exceptionally hot by Scotland standards. The rooms were unbearably hot. There are no Fans in the room. So you are at the mercy of that crack-open window.

Upon arrving and checking in, we were shown to our rooms by the young porter, which happened to be up 3 flights of stairs and where possibly the furthest away rooms possible from the entrance of the hotel, given that we had wedding dresses, bridesmaid dress etc this was far from ideal. We then began bringing in 2 cars worth of case's, dresses and everything else required for the bridal party for the wedding day as well as the day following the wedding; at this point the porter was back in the room behind reception, while the receptionist watch 3 women make 4 journeys back and forth from the car to the rooms, whilst commenting 'Oh you'll get fit and build muscles carrying all that' - fuming was an understatement! The day of our wedding was wonderful, however the logistics of getting photographers/videographers/make up, as well as the rest of the wedding party up to the rooms was a challenge, never mind trying to get out of the hotel without breaking a neck whilst trying to navigate the winding stairs in a wedding dress!

16514604,"If you like your hotels scruffy on the outside,dated on the inside with no room service and just as bad in the restaurant this the place for you!The hotel is dreadful .3 stars and you expect some sort of quality .None.Having read the other reports one can only suspect they have low expectations of a hotel.Its one of those places where if one small thing annoys you it sets the trend to purposefully look for other faults.Meals can only be described as pityful for the money.The service down right attrocious and the room we stayed in poor.The room we had was a deluxe family room with two double beds.The decor dated as the green bathroom with DIY mastic to the bath edge and a miss matched coloured sink.It was annexed to the main hotel complex and called the clan room.Wish we could say ''at least it was clean'',but no.The shower head grubby and unsanitised for years .The bath fills with a lovely rust tinge and left a residue of rust ,grit and particles when emptied ,not from us we would add.An evening meal in the hotel proved very mediocre with the rib eye steak sent back as it was so tough it came with a knukle duster and side arm.Although the meat balls which was taken in lieu was quite tasty and a welcome replacement.The restaurant manager did try and charge for the steak as well,until I requested one of the waiters to step in and explain. Room service did not occur on the first day resulting in us returning to an unkempt room at 6.30 pm .No loo roll,only the towel,yes one towel ,left in the bath from the morning to cover 3 of us from the day before.Complain to the young apprentice at reception and refering to Margaret I got no apololgy but a stern 'it should have been!'.You can guess the permutations of my reply. Hot water from the taps barely raised to 39 degrees no where near the mandatory 60 degrees.A digital thermometer was used to check it.Breakfast is cleared at 9.00 am, so if your a late riser tough for breakfast. On the plus side er,well you have off road parking if you can find a space not taken up by non residents.The road noise will wake you in time for your breakfast.The clan room is a good size and has a satelite served TV.Tea making facility in the room with unbranded tea and coffee selection.Soap and shampoo was by handy 1970's wall mounted pumps, with contents which matched the hotel standard.  The name on the outside sign says Avon ridge Hotel,the B had fell off,overtones of another hotel whose name changes due to letter alterations?Room rate was a extortinate 90 pound per night .Comparing that to the local and recently completed Holiday Inn Express at 50 pounds this was a place one should think twice about staying at. Stay was for 3 nights although by the second I needed a calming word from the wife 'it was only for one more night'otherwise I would have checked out. The eclectic decor ,part mock italian with gawdy paintings on the walls by a unamed local art enthusiast and part traditional mock victorian was a humourous talking point in the dimly lit ,badly manned bar . My wife had a penchant for the place being originally from the area she said on the way up 'it was were the posh people stayed when she was a little girl'.30 years on and the addition of conservatories to the restaurant and front elevation had done nothing tostem the deterioration of the fabric.

Try telling that to the poor American family who woke on Sat morning to find their car window had been smashed and their holiday gear stolen. Or to the Scottish couple (who had used the hotel previously without incident) but also woke up to a smashed rear window and stuff stolen. Three cars had been damaged - all the result of the town's biggest night club being 200 metres away and revellers wandering down the hill and through the public car park. When staff tell me this is 'not a problem', I don't believe them. I wonder how often the Police are to be found in the hotel lobby dealing with these incidents.The room was ludicrously hot and stuffy, the road facing window opened only a fraction, but this of course was pointless as opening the window only served to let the yelps and screeches of the passing late night revellers disturb any sleep we could grab.

There was a red stain on our carpet (wine? blood?) and the bathroom smelt faintly of stale wee.

Do you have sugar puffs? ~ No.Do you have frosties?  ~ No.Ok then I will just have a fried breakfast please.She then went off and came back with a small box of coco-pops and some honeynut cornflakes, I said that was very kind I would have the coco-pops, before she left, she gave me orange juice from another table.I went to open the coco-pops and noticed they were out of date (by a year) so decided against this, then I went to pour the orange juice but the jug was dirty, so decided against that also and waited patiently for my breakfast, when it arrived I made the lady aware of the out of date coco-pops and the dirty jug which she took away.Whilst I was eating and enjoying my breakfast, she came back and said âMrs Clark the jug was not dirty I had just poured two jugs into oneâ I said it didnât matter but she kept repeating herself, again I said it didnât matter, after a few times I got up without finishing my breakfast and went upstairs to pack as I decided then I did not want to stay any longer!

My companion decided on the Steak Burger, which arrived completely pink and uncooked in the middle.  When enquiries were made with the waitress we were advised that this is due to spices which make it pink,  which was completely untrue as the texture was that of uncooked mince.  When first approaching the tables in the conservatory area look bright and clean but when actually seated, they had a vague smell of staleness.  The place was also stone-dead when we visited which is an indication of the poor food on offer.  Having used to be a regular I was sorely disappointed and feel the place has went right downhill.

403154959,"I stayed with my family two weeks at the hotel during our summer holidays. The hotel was disappointing not really a 4 star standard (rather mediocre 3 star). The surroundings of the hotel are rather ugly close to the industrial port of Livorno. Service at the hotel is below average. You need to pay 10 Euro per person for towels which is really not acceptable for a 4 star hotel. Donât expect a sunbed at the crowed and ugly beach, you will only get two chairs and one umbrella even if you have more than two persons in your room! The biggest rip off is the spa since you only get free access for one person for one day even if your party has more than 1 person. Why pay for a four star hotel if you have to pay extra for the spa? The pool was ok but in high season there are not enough sunbeds and umbrellaâs for all the guests and the hotel is not strict enough to remove towels from sunbeds that have been âreservedâ by guests who are away sometimes for several hours. On one day, the pool guard took away one of our two umbrella's (although we were three persons). He argued that we there is only one umbrella per room. When I argued there were plenty umbrella's available, his only reaction was that I should go and sit in my hotelroom if I wanted shade.  Unacceptable for a so-called 4 star hotel. Although the hotel has a Michelin star restaurant, the food served at the other restaurant (for guests in half board) is rather poor for Italian standards. In addition, dishes and glasses in the restaurant were not properly cleaned (really disgusting). Breakfast is very poor with very little choice (hardly any fresh vegetables, scrambled eggs were disgusting, no fresh orange juice, limited choice of bread, coffee not drinkable which is surprising since Italian coffee should be among the best in the world, â¦). We also faced a lot of technical problems during our stay: powercut for a few hours during the first day, no air-condition for an entire day. Last but not least the internet is not scaled for the amount of guests in high season. The hotel charges 5 star prices for a mediocre three star service.

331935261,"This was my second year providing entertainment in the Tiffany Ballroom for a company Christmas party.  The previous year was nothing to write about, fairly standard.  This year was atrocious.  It all began when the buffet food was wheeled out to sit on carts long before the guests even arrived and I'm including seafood here.  The hot food wasn't far behind and broiled away in the carafes for almost an hour.  I will eat darn near anything, especially when I'm working, but I ended up throwing away the majority of what was on my plate.The salad dressing bowls had been replaced with mason jars and tablespoons.  I mean, the spoons were the exact length of the jar to begin with, so you're getting dressing all over your hands, and when you finally pry the filthy spoon out of the jar, there's no dressing on it because it's all slid off the end of the spoon.  When I commented about this to one of the staff I was told (with a smile) that the serving dishes kept getting thrown out accidentally and there was only &quot;so much room in the monthly budget.&quot;The lights went out three times during the dinner service.  I saw the banquet manager (I assume) fiddling with the knobs when it happened.  I don't know if he was trying to dim the lights and couldn't figure it out or if there was a problem with the controller, but once during the set up and twice with the buffet completely occupied, we were plunged into darkness for about 30 seconds a time.  That can seem like an eternity when you have a plate full of messy food and an expensive outfit.The microphone on the stage that had been provided by the venue looked as if it was some ancient relic, and when the MC attempted to use it, he was unintelligible, and it immediately began to cut out.  Luckily, I come with spares. A server, helping clear a table, put all the empty glasses and beer bottles on my table and left them there for the rest of the night.

When I arrived at the hotel I noticed a huge construction site right across the street with lots of noise so I requested a room at the back of the hotel away from the noise. Went up to my room to discover that it looked directly over the construction site. Went to reception to ask for a different room, repeating my request to be away from the construction. Was given a corner unit but still facing the construction. Third trip down to reception I was told that if I wanted to upgrade to a back-facing room, it would cost me an extra $50/night. After I asked to speak to the manager, the reception clerk said I could have the back room for $25 extra/night. At this point I started looking for another hotel on my phone. Manager came out, saw me on my phone (close to tears at this point) and approached me with an offer to stay in a back room for no extra charge, plus 2 breakfasts. Thank you, Mr. Manager, but why wasnât I accommodated at first request? Why should a guest (Iâm a Hilton Honors guest, too) have to pay extra for a room away from noisy construction?

14593609,"I was staying in town with family and went to this hotel to get internet access as I had a lot I needed to take care of online.The rate was high, with taxes and parking it cost me over $200 and I found it to be very poor value.  The parking lot was part of the mall parking lot and I had to drive around in circles about six times before I found a spot to squeeze into and it was not even a proper parking stall.  The room was cheaply furnished.  The lampshade was made of paper and the door set up for the main door, washroom door and closet door all opened into each other and was awkward.  They called this a King size suite upgrade and it was very small for a suite.  When I ordered a refrigerator it was an extra charge and they placed it on the floor which was not at all practical.  I started to use my laptop and immediately was having &quot;page cannot be displayed&quot; errors... not consistenly... only every second page.  This was very frustrating to me.  For example, I would compose an email and when I hit send, the email would be lost.  If I was signed onto a sight the next click would take me out of the site and I would have to sign in again.  I called to complain and explained that I needed internet service, the whole purpose of my stay.  They called me back and said the hotel was full and that there was no other room they could move me to.  I found this surprising.  The only solution offered was to go all the way up to their executive Opus lounge (that was closed) and I was told I could work in there until it opens at 6 a.m.  It was not convenient as I had to get dressed and the front desk person assisted by carrying up my tray with my drinks and ice on it.  I got up there and I was left alone.  The internet worked with no issues, like high speed should... however it was not long before I had to use the washroom... but there was no washroom, the only remaining option was to leave the room, take the elevator down 11 stories to my room and leave my laptop, etc up in the lounge, call back to the front desk to again come up and use their card to let me back in.  Needless to say, I did not stay up there long as there were no proper facilities.  The only positive thing in my stay was that the bed was comfortable and I liked that the front desk did make an attempt to help resolve the issue although I strongly feel that management should have stepped up to the plate.  I took the time to complain and although they offered me a temporary solution it was not a feasible one, which I told them.  No manager contacted me at the hotel to apologize or ask if they could compensate me.  I went online and took the time to fill out a survey for them and in it I went into great detail as to my disappointing stay with them.  Surprisingly, a manager did contact me but he never offered any compensation and I replied and told him I thought this was poor service and that they should make ammends for my stay considering the sole purpose of my time with them was to use the internet yet I could not - but I never heard back from that manager again - thus they have failed me yet again.Therefore I tell everyone I know, not to bother staying there.  It certainly was not worth it.  The value was one of the poorest of all the hotels I have stayed at and I stay and many hotels within any given month.  Do not waste your money.  Choose to stay downtown where you are central to everything and the accommodations are much more up to standard.

Walkable to public transport to get downtown, and also easy directions in order to get to some of the other neighborhoods and tourist sites. Two grocery stores within a two block radius.Cons:- it was hard to avoid the smells/exhaust of the attached Asian food court. Even at the pool ...- the hot tub is the smallest I've ever seen - it can really only fit 3-4, and that's if you know each other. It would be super awkward to be in the hot tub with strangers. We tried 3 times, and only found it empty once. The other pools are also small - a lap pool and a small square pool I'm guessing is meant to be for small kids.- our room wasn't ready by the 3pm check in, and even though I checked in in advance, have status, and specifically selected our room. Whatever the housekeeping process is, it needs to be looked in to, such that rooms are flipped based on check-in times and reservations. This is not the Hilton service I'm used to, and I could have done without the snarky tone and service from the Front Desk employee.- my 'On Arrival' amenities weren't in my room, and I did not receive them during my stay - I had requested an extra pillow, and honestly didn't want to complain to the Front Desk any more after the awful check in experience and the WiFi issues.- the WiFi didn't work.

HOWEVER,the noise was completely unacceptable the second night that we stayed here.  My family and I were on a two day trip to vancouver to attend some unfortunate family matters so we decided to stay at this hilton in metro town assuming that it would be the best when it came to comfort.  we had to wake up very early the next morning so hoped to have a good sleep in their comfortable bed.  When we got back to the hotel on saturday night it was around 11 p.m and we could already hear partying in the room next to us.  however, we decided to try and ignore it for a while since it was before midnight.  the noise only got louder and louder by midnight with girls screaming, music booming, and men yelling.  so by midnight i decided to give front desk a call asking if they could lower the noise...after 20 minutes nothing changed, the partying only got louder of course so i called again.  they said that they walked by our floor a few times and could only hear loud talking.. so i told them it might've been the floor on top of us then assuming i was the one wrong with where i thought the noise was coming from.  another 20 minutes went by nd still nothing had changed.. so after anotheer scream i decided to get up and walk out. into the hallway .. and just as i did i ran into the security guard who told me that he couldnt find the noise until i told him to come into my room and hear it.. he then understood that it was VERY LOUD and figure it out finally it was next door.  so i went back to bed and he knocked on the door...when the partyers opened the door all i heard the security guard say was &quot;there are noisecomplaints on your floor from other guests, can you please keep it down&quot; of course the partyers were mildly quiet for the next 5 minutes.. nd i quickly fell asleep... ten minutes later the noise was back up and now ppl were running up and down the halls as well and slamming doors... nothing changed and the noise went on until 3:30 in the morning.  im not a person to usually complain very much as i am a young adult myself so i didnt call again because i thought the security like most hotels would come back every so often to make sure the noise was really gone.  it is EXPECTED at a hotel especially like the hilton that there should be a noise policy for after midnight and if there are problems continueing that ppl who are not guests of the room should be escorted out.  i have stayed at many MOTELS that have such strict policy and it was absolutely unacceptable that the hilton staff let this noise go on until 3:30 in the morning.  to say the least, our whole family got no sleep that night and we were very very disappointed.",-1,2,0.466689815

Also, the walls and doors are thin and noise comes in the rooms easily.  Dont get a room near the elevator as you will be annoyed by the loud beep that the elevator makes when it arrives, plus people getting on and off it and talking loudly is annoying, I dealt with this every morning when people would start leaving at around 7am and on.  Parking is free, below the hotel, but a little tight if you are driving an SUV like I was.  The area surrounding the hotel is very developed and not of any real beauty, lots of asian stores, and a mall attached to the hotel that is 100% asian, even the signs are all in asian.  Across the street, you have the Metrocenter, which is a huge, I mean huge get lost easy kind of mall, they have everything, from gap, Banana Republic, markets, etc.  You will also find a Starbucks across the street, and many around town. There is also a skytrain stop on one end of the Metrocenter, which conveniently takes you to all the major attractions downtown, and to the water front.

The hotel at first appearance is dreary, old, and unclean.  The front desk personnel were just as dreary.  The rooms smelled and the beds looked unwelcoming and felt just as bad.  I too was afraid to lie down on the bed and see a bug.  The rooms were very stuffy so you would need to turn on the fan but it was so loud and had poor circulation that you just rather turn it off.  I have done extensive traveling and have been able to find hotels that are reasonably priced but yet are quite welcoming.  I am not a picky tourist and can easily go with the flow but I also recognize quality.  Quality can be had at eighty dollars a night.  Howard Johnsons gives you a fair nightly rate but extremely bad quality.  Also, the City Centre that they add to the name of the hotel is misleading.  It is not within walking distance of the downtown area.  Luckily we took our car because you would need to take a taxi every time you go out.  There are not many nearby restaurants and some of the unsavory characters I saw coming out of the bar looked well...unsavory.  Also, the pool water looked cloudy.  I didn't want my son to go in but he insisted yet he came out ok.  Overall, I recommend spending thirty dollars more and with that getting a restful night's sleep.",-1,0,0.506216931

The rugs are so disgusting that I did not want to even take my socks off. There are cob webs around the window and the noise coming from the bathroom fan was unbearable. The conditions in the room was not good this got me thinking if this place had gritters in the beds and we swear their was a mice running around. I could not sleep having these thoughts. The front desk person was nice enough to change my room exept that she thought I was crazy. The new room we had was not better even with a king size bed, too dusty to believe this is a hotel. Overall, the hotel was full of kids running around the hallway. The indoor pool is filthy from all the kids. They had a restaurant which was not operating through out the day. The aftermath as a result of a complaint to howard johnson franchise because there are too many things wrong with this franchise yet we had never stayed at a good howard johnson-nevermind of the horour story of the howard johnson in the United States. This is a leason for us not to stay at this hotel and propably not at any howard johnsons.

Instead, he pretty much blamed it on us for waiting for a long time between the time we checked in and the time I was calling and that they would not be able to sell the room anymore by that time. I felt like this was a really bad customer service, that is, he's more concerned about the room not getting sold over the customer's discomfort.

We are sad to say that we paid much too much for terrible accommodations. Its been a long time since we've stayed at such a run down hotel (think 70's motel with blinking neon light in a seedy part of town). Our mini suite in particular had many issues. Our bed pitched downwards so our heads ended up being lower than our feet and I had to stand up and walk around every  hour to move blood back to the rest of my body. My 19 year old daughter slept on the pullout bed and every time she moved the bed sounded like it was sawing her in half (loud rusty hinge noise...terrifying). It woke us all up every time she moved and suffice it to say she had a terrible night sleep. The fridge was unplugged and when we plugged it in (that's why we rented a suite with a kitchenette...to use the amenities), it sounded like a guillotine coming down every time it shut off (about every 10 minutes). I would love to say that I'm being dramatic but sadly...this is exactly what it was like. It was so bad we had to laugh about it. We slept in the car on the way home and got a much better sleep thankfully. We will not be staying here again. If you have any sleep issues or back issues or if you actually like to sleep at all...you probably want to stay away from this place. Also on the internet we were told that we would receive free breakfast for 2...that didn't happen for any of us in any of the 4 rooms.

The hotel itself is surrounded by shopping malls, strip retail, and car lots, so not very fun. Even the bar/restaurant in the hotel is closed.The hotel itself is old, with lots of issues.  The wifi didn't work, the ice maker was broken, the room was run down, and the room was so dark you needed a flashlight to navigate. The staff is very nice and based on the strong scent of chlorine bleach the place seemed clean, if well worn. The room was very small. Finally, for my stay, the one night stay was over $200, so not much of a bargain either. Personally, I'll avoid this place next time I'm in Victoria.",-1,0,0.464803419

We then got changed to another room, which was hotter than the sahara, heater was broken, and on full blast. Our 3rd room had a hole punched in the wall, and cracks in the bathroom floor. After 3 room changes, there was no manager around. Doesn't he do room checks.. Is he that clueless his hotel is in shambles???

Beach â only has chairs, no sun loungers. You need to pay an additional 8 euros per person PER DAY to have a sun lounger on the beach4. Food â breakfast â dreadful â terrible coffee (hard to do in Italy!), no fresh orange juice, no fresh fruit, no pastries, no choice5. Dinner â basic buffet of salad and choice of 5 main courses all covered with the same tasting sauce6. Entertainment â none â not even some background music after dinner outside for three of the evenings â totally dull, nothing to do, no atmosphere at all 7. No wifi - except for a charge8.

218306088,"We stayed 2 nights after a fabulous 2 week self-catering holiday in in-land Tuscany, to treat ourselves to a nice hotel and the kids to a beach break before flying home from Pisa.  Sadly disappointed by hotel, which had so much potential but was let down by so many cumulative little things.First, the good things. Spacious family room, lovely beach, nice pool.  Table tennis and children's playground, nice garden area.  Sadly, reception staff were neither welcoming nor helpful.  Having struggled to find the hotel, when we finally located it I popped in to ask where to park while husband and young children waited in car outside.  Hotel car park is mentioned on website.  Firstly, receptionist told me she could not give me this information until I had handed over all passports and filled in check-in paperwork - I tried to explain that we would park up safely and then all come in to do this, but she said this wasn't possible.  Registering took ages, about 20 minutes.  Then she said we could park outside for free but risk towing as there was a local event on the next day, or pay 15E per day for the hotel car park.  When I queried this, as their website hadn't mentioned a charge, she immediately waived the charge and gave me a permit.  We parked according to her map and the next day received a demand for payment from the hotel on the windscreen.  Not ideal!  Went back to reception who said to ignore this.We requested quiet room on check-in, because of young children, and were assured it would be very quiet.  Unfortunately it overlooked the street outside, where the local event proved to be a sports tournament accompanied by loud throbbing beat music from 6pm-1am.  Didn't manage to get kids to sleep till midnight as so loud.  Breakfast looked nice, tasted horrible.  Doubt fruit juices had seen much fruit, tasted more like orange squash from bottle diluted with water.  Plastic cheese. Worse coffee (from machine) ever, poor show for Italy.Charged tourist tax on check-out rather than check-in.  As we were heading straight from hotel to airport, and charge was unexpected, literally had to count out payment in small coins which visibly annoyed receptionist.  Fed-up with the eye rolling, I politely suggested that it might be a good idea to tell people about the charge when they checked in - this was just intended as a helpful comment, but unleashed a torrent of ranting in response.  With the money lying on the desk, and no end of the rant in sight, I literally had to say, look, it's all there, check it if you want but I need to leave for the airport.  I got another rant about foreign tourists, so just quietly walked away.  Not how anyone wants to leave a hotel!  Could have been lovely, but very badly let down by staff.  We won't be back.  This is the only negative review I've ever given on Trip Advisor, and I'm mainly doing it in the hope that the management get the staff to buck their ideas up so others have nicer time.",-1,2,0.55520202

The building itself is a concrete monstrosity and although we had a room with a balcony over looking the pool it also over looked all the the airconditing units, satellite dishes etc of the beach restarants.  The pool might be 50m but unless you are a die hard swimmer it is way too cold to get in and I speak as a regular swimmer - it really took your breath away!  Also don't expect peace and quiet as it appears it is usual to jet wash the loungers and chairs around the pool during the day.  The food was dull - the salad buffet was rarely replenished, always, always pasta - not even a risotto or tortollini - followed by meat and potatoes!  Don't expect to get anything else outside the hotel as the only restaurants served exactly the same sort of thing but with the addition of pizza! Tirrenia is a very sad and old fashioned resort and at this time of year basically closed.  None of the beach cafes were open and only a few of the other restaurants were open and then you had to compete with the ever present TV (mainly showing football) whilst eating.Add the above to poor weather and we felt like prisoners!

The reception area and most of the ground floor would have been very grand when it opened but now it's really quite dated.  The room that we had looked nothing like the photos - it was tired and in need of redecoration.  It was a very basic room - we've stayed in cheaper places that had better rooms.  They were dark and dingy rather than light and modern.The bathroom was in dire need of work - mouldy bath sealant / rusty shower doors.  The shower was over the bath but when the doors were shut there was very little room to move making showering quite difficult - it would have been better to have just had a shower in the bathroom.Breakfast was possibly the worst that we had during our trip.  We had not been told where the breakfast was being served so it took a bit of time to find the room.  The staff just didn't seem to want to be bothered, the fruit juice hadn't seen a fruit in it's life in our opinion and the breakfast itself was very, very poor with bad coffee.The pool looked lovely but in order to use it you had to have either brought a swimming cap with you (unless they tell you when you book, how would you know to bring one?) or you had to spend 2euros per person in buying one as you can't swim without wearing one - never experienced that before at any hotel that we have stayed at!  Not quite sure as to what the reasoning was!  We booked the hotel as it was the last hotel we were staying in before we arrived at our holiday accommodation so we thought we would spend just that little bit more and spoil ourselves a bit but we left very, very disappointed.If you are looking for a hotel in this area and you are after a 4 star or equivalent hotel then this is one to avoid it is not worth the money.",-1,4,0.553878601

340582771,"Me and my (now ex-)girlfriend traveled here with a big family: two of my kids and two of her kids from previous marriages, plus her younger brother and his girlfriend. We landed late at night, and only had to wait about two hours in the reception before we could access our rooms. The next morning the kids (ranging from 4 - 10 years old) wanted to try out the pool, a pool that was possible to find by following the sound of kids playing in the water, and guessing where to walk (no signs). Me and my girlfriend wanted to find a supermarket so we could get a few necessities. Her brother and his girlfriend (aged 32 and 25) agreed to stay with the kids in the pool.We all went to the reception, made sure the kids had permissions to use the pool, written consent, wristbands around their arms, all the cards they needed. Finally, after about an hour of formalities, we asked the two girls in the reception if this was it. Did they have everything they needed to use the pool now? Yes. Si, signore! Nodding heads. So, we left our kids, searching two hours to find a supermarket. We asked at the local restaurant, the local cafÃ©, and the local bakery (about 1 square meter big, run by a mean hustler who will always cheat you on the change back-money), and got no help. Of course local merchants don't want tourists to find supermarkets, where the food prices are 1/3 or 1/4 of their own. The nearest supermarket we could find, were about five miles from the hotel, south, but very well hidden, looking like a private residence from the outside. There is a bigger and more visible one about seven miles to the north.Meanwhile, the four kids and their two babysitters went to the pool, with all their wristbands and their array of permissions. In the process of jumping into the giant pool, they were blocked by a guy who looked like some kind of lifeguard, Lorenzo. This man claimed they were not allowed to use the pool, unless they were wearing swimming caps, caps which he happened to sell. In fact, that was all he did: Sell swimming caps, while posing as a lifeguard, on several occasions ignoring nearly drowning kids' screams for help.  The price per cap? 2 Euros. Now, we'd just arrived in Europe. The two grownups looking after the kids did not posses Euros. They had no idea where to go to exchange money. Lorenzo the hustler certainly did not help,. since he knew if they could find an ATM or an exchange-station, they could also find the small souvenir-shop in the village that sold swimming caps for 0,50 Euros. Further, the kids' non-European cell phones did not work, so they could not get in touch with us. Their only choice in the increasingly boiling hot sun, was to wait by the poolside, while watching other kids enjoy themselves and cool off in the pool.The receptionists claim there is no rule about swimming caps in the pool, and they claim to have no knowledge of Lorenzo. If he wants to charge money for swimming caps and act but not behave like a lifeguard, that's obviously his business. When he physically restrain kids from using the pool, though, with no rules or regulations to support him, I feel it might be a matter for the police.Frankly, there is no repairing this sort of damage for me. Not that anyone tried any sort of mending. Our kids were put in an uncomfortable and risky situation, to accommodate some sort of hustle. Yes, the beach at Tirrenia is nice. If you order the big bowl of seafood at the restaurant closest to the beach, you will have a reasonably good meal at an unreasonably expensive price. For the bill you pay, though, you might buy ten pizzas and five kegs of wine at &quot;The Big Gulliver&quot;, an absolutely decent place in the village, or 50 good meals at a local non-tourist place in Pisa, which is about two hours travel away.",-1,5,0.42372342

There is nice restaurant near by but a bit on the expensive side &amp; not an every night kind of place.The only thing that is most definitely open is the 'black line' bar across the road ...

Decent size though.  Mini bar is fully stocked with a decent selection - we resorted to the half bottle of red on the second night after failed attempts in the 'American bar' but it hasn't been replaced as yet.Bath water came out as a disgusting muddy brown - sadly not a quirk of the area as you find with some places, but just a vile surprise when I went to check it.

Being on the ground floor meant we could either have privacy and security by keeping the giant window shut and blocked, or we could have some fresh air.  The bathroom was dark and dingy with a tiled two-foot by two-foot shower.  While massively overpriced due to its proximity to downtown Vancouver, this motel is not convenient for getting downtown or anywhere else.

It swirled around and then the water leaked out leaving us with raw sewage for our &quot;four&quot; nights stay. The third day we were late leaving the room and room cleaning service passed us by. I made a special trip to the front desk to make sure we wer not overlooked for room service. I was assured room service was until 5:30pm and that our room would be cleaned. It was not. The front desk made no effort to check to see we were not passed over. The room was dirty and smoky. So, if you stay there take several bottles of febreze for the air.

The photos we were shown on the hotel's internet page didn't look too bad either.The location of the hotel is ok - in North Vancouver only a short drive away from Capilano Bridge and Grouse Mountain tourist attractions. Next to that there is not much to see on Marine Drive.You can take a bus downtown (it doesn't run frequently especially at weekend evenings, so check before!). I recommend taking the seabus on at least one way - you will have a great view of the skyline. To the hotel itself: We were in for a nice surprise after the photos on the web. The room looked very worn and had a persistent mildewy smell that wouldn't go away even after some venting. In one corner there were some dusty cobwebs. Bathroom: The toilet handle broke after first usage. It was replaced fairly quickly, however the way the new one was attached we could only use it with utmost care. The shower looked more like something I was used to during my days in the army than a hotel shower. I recommend wearing flip-flops! There were traces of mildew in the corners but we almost expected that by now. The shower head was fixed and couldn't be moved either way. The water supply was plentiful and not just drip drops... at least one good thing.Breakfast: They do not offer breakfast but there is a Denny's around the corner. If you like that kind of food you can just walk over. Apparently you get a discount there as Travelodge guest  - however nobody told us and I just found out by reading some of the other reviews here.Conclusion: the location is OK if cou do not require downtown accomodation and know when the busses are running.

The desk clerk told me she'd give me a king bed with a fold-out sofa at the same price, like it was a favor. The room was behind the lobby and seemed to be a converted storage area. The lighting was nauseating, like a storage facility. My wife opened a bar of soap and found a long hair inside - do they rewrap soap bars? The ceiling above the bed had industrial tape holding it together. The AC was badly damaged and lacking labels - I asked the desk clerk when she came by with a new bar of soap what the settings were, but not being very proficient in English, she couldn't really explain it to me. There was a sliding door, which opened to reveal some left over lumber and an industrial machine, further confirming that this room was once a storage unit. There were extension cords everywhere, as if it was someone's apartment. The bed was uncomfortable (I didn't want to fold out the sofa, since so much else was skeevy) And all this cost us only $136.

No kidding. The new room she got was much better but still had a faint aroma of urine. The place looks like they are trying to update. Some of the furniture/fixtures are newer and some are beat up and shabby. Even the non pet room my husband and I got had an unpleasant, musty odor.

One of the rooms had wet carpet from a leaking window or A/C unit.  They have tried to dress it up a bit with new carpet and furniture. The bath towels were thin and about 2 ft square.

The smell was really horrible, the heater didn't work, no bathtub, leaking shower, weird noises all night, ancient TV, just really bad value for $150/night.  I finally asked to be moved and spent my last night in a room that was a vast improvement, but still nothing special for that price.

552045054,"I have thought long and hard about writing this review, because a part of me was wanting to just let bygones be bygones. However, the disrespectful treatment that we received during our stay is not something I can simply forget about and move on from. Among many examples I could state, we can begin with a technical/safety one: during a power outage, safety protocols were not followed, and we were left without any source of light (i.e.: candles, led lights, etc - none were in the room) and were freezing, as there was no heat. There was no one at the reception desk, which by standard should be open 24 hours, especially during an outage. There are more items that could very well be elaborated on, but the one particular point I'd like to share is the sheer disrespect and awful attitude of the management. I have never felt so degraded in my life. Rationality and calmness were met with threats, and I felt extremely upset afterwards. We were in town to celebrate our engagement, and this turned it into a horrible memory that I wish I could erase.  To clarify, I was not looking for a Shangri-La experience, simply a cozy place to stay on a budget. However, this fell so far below my expectations, that it is hard to describe my feeling of disappointment. I deeply regret staying there. (To clarify, reception desk attendant was lovely and accommodating, my intent here is to point out the sheer unprofessionalism of management.) ",-1,2,0.578075397

I will tell you why this is positively one of the WORST hotels I have ever stayed in.Positive- nice small lobby.Negative- Where should I even start- I came with my family of 5. The room which cost me over 300 per night was the size of a shoebox, NYC size. Ok, that would be bad enough. But it was filthy. (management excuse- &quot;its an old hotel&quot;. Many things didnt work. But like a NYC hotel, you have to walk up and down stairs and corridors, after the elevators, to get to your room- with family luggage, its impossible. (management excuse- 300 a night is cheap for a downtown Vancouver hotel, and that I can call someone to help me with my luggage (ie a bellman).Lets talk about SAFETY. I came with young children. Vancouver has grown into a seedy town (I stayed here in the past, but the entire city has gone downhill). But this hotel is on the seedy side of downtown. Lets see. XXX rated peep shows 3 doors down from the hotel. Homeless people sleeping on the street right outside the hotel. Marijuana dispensary around the corner. My kids were asking me questions I didnt WANT to answer. And they tell you in no uncertain terms, to watch your belongings. Signs up in the parking lot, etc. Ok, do I NEED this for 330 a night??? it was UNSAFE. I was told by the desk I could walk to a restaurant.. one turn around the corner tells you, you dont WANT to walk there. So whats the use of being in this area of downtown?Then the pool is not only impossible to get to (elevator, then walk down stairs and accross, then walk down 3 flights), but its dangerous for kids to swim alone. Its tiny, yet goes from 1m (3ft) to 3 m(9ft) in a few feet of space. Ok, I watched my kids, then opened a door and found my self face to face with a dining guest- this shares a door with their main restaurant, I was standing their dripping wet face to face with a well dressed couple having a &quot;fancy dinner&quot;. It made no sense!!!I also want to stress I am a IHG GOLD HONORS member. So of course the hotel will accomodate my issues, right? OH, they cant do ANYTHING about the price.. (oh really? My credit card says otherwise). I said IHG has a satisfaction guarantee. THey said yes. I said Ok, so how are they going to accomodate me? They told me to call Holiday Inn but they were not going to accomodate the room rate (or the taxes or the 3 other types of fees they add on and dont explain to you- expect 15% minimum higher than you thought you were going to pay!!There are really nice places on the other side of downtown that are much nicer. I passed by many nice hotels near the harbor center, such as the marriot, which would have made a MUCH better choice.One of the worst possible experiences I could have had. I dont understand why ANYONE would want to stay here. Unless they were stupid, like I was, or read the other reviews who have different lower expectations.

179399238,"We were invited to a wedding on a harbor cruise out of Coal Harbour, Vancouver.  On the wedding invitations it indicated a block of rooms was set aside for the wedding party in downtown Vancouver at a rate of $150 a night. I called in several months prior to the day to make the reservation and confirmed the $150 rate.The morning of the wedding I called the hotel to try and get a room for 3pm as we had to be at the boat no later than 4:30 pm. This would allow us to get changed at the hotel. The person answering, said they would try, but no guarantees. We didn't risk it, and got changed before coming into downtown.   When we arrived around 3pm, we attempted to check in and were told our room wasn't available yet.  While in the lobby, our friends had asked the attendant to call a cab for 4pm and the attendant told him it wasn't necessary because cabs came up here all the time.  We parked our vehicle, grabbed a coffee, and came back 45 minutes later and then were able to check in to our room.The room rate was $160, rather than the agreed upon $150.  I discussed this with the front desk to no avail. The front desk attendant was useless and unhelpful.  I didn't want to raise an issue over $10 just before the wedding, so I let it go until the next day. The additional $10 is one thing, but the principle is important. Getting cabs for many of the people going to this same wedding on time was a stressful challenge. We made it in time, but some were not so fortunate.  This probably held the boat up.A positive about this place was that the night staff were easy going about us having a night cap in the lobby area of the hotel.I read here in another review, that the person that designed this hotel probably never stayed in hotels.  Now, I understand that comment. There are two towers in this hotel and logic is thrown out out the window in the hotel room # ordering, connecting towers and labyrinths to get around.The next next morning I tried to deal up the change in room rate issue after I had confirmed the rate at reservation and had no success.

Great.  They put us on the &quot;executive&quot; level.   What was so disheartening though is that the second I opened the door to the new room, the overpowering odor of cigarette smoke came upon me.  The room was much bigger and it was DEFINITELY cooler - but it absolutely reeked.   By this time, it was 8:00 p.m. - I was tired - I had to get up at 4:00 a.m. the next morning anyway and I just resolved myself to knowing that this was not going to be a great stay.  The AC was a little noisy, kinda old, but it worked.  I had a horrible sleep because I kept waking up feeling like I couldn't breath because the room just had a stale, old, cigarette smell to it. And, yes, it was a &quot;non smoking&quot; room.   I appreciated them moving me but I would not stay here again.  Our meal in the hotel was very reasonable however the staff was a bit flaky.  The hostess only gave us one menu and said she'd be back with another one (which took about 6 minutes - and it was NOT busy at all).  The waiter didn't tell us the special (we overheard another waitress telling her customers - but this was after we had ordered), and he did not bring out dinner rolls.   The other thing that irritated me is that I'm a Priority Club Member and am suppose to receive free room upgrades if they are available.  Well, considering they were able to move me into an &quot;executive room&quot; because I was hot, this proved to me that this room was available to begin with and I should've been put into it in the first place.   So much for being a club member.   Lastly, just for anyone who cares, the 2 elevators near the lobby that access the tower with the central system, are very, very, small.

Even with the air conditioning on the unit was still blowing hot air so I just turned it off. The only other option was to open the window to cool the room down, but the outside noise would keep you awake. Brought this to the attention of the front desk the first night, but they never did follow up. If you are staying here for business (or have kids), although they advertise high speed wireless internet this is not the case. Internet access was sporadic at best. This was also brought to the attention of the front desk with no follow up.

The staff i spoke to appeared shady and promised to get a room quickly and i felt like she made me wait on purpose. Very ridiculous. If the checking out time is 12pm, a room should be ready at least by 2pm. cos some guests bound to arrive early and they should be accommodated as what i had experience with other hotels before.

This company contacts with Getaroom.com, and Holiday Inn's on-line booking automatically defaults to this web-based server.

The hotel's policy is that they will allow you to cancel within 24 hours with no penalty.  My wife and I found a better deal and tried to cancel, but were told we'd be charged anyway.  That was over $500 for a room we were told by Holiday Inn would have only cost us $427.  Our advice, call the hotel first, don't use these on-line booking contractors.

But I will not be returning for my next trip. The past two times I have stayed have been awful. When I stayed in March out room was dirty (vomit in the bathroom) and we were on a floor where a sports team was staying and it was loud all night a s received many knocks at our door from our neighbors. Later in re evening when we arrived back at the hotel from our event we went to the vending Machine and were greeted rudely by the night staff and told to get back to our room immediately. We left out stay with a bad taste in our mouth from that but we had already booked our next stay with them and decided to give them one last chance. This stay was for a concert. We arrived at the hotel/ checked in and were getting ready when a housekeeping staff walks into our room. We were a bit surprised but we didn't complain. As we were about to leave for our concert A STRANGE MAN walks into our room. He didn't speak English well he shows us his keys and they had out room number on it(they ha checked him into our room one night early...we still don't believe how this happens). He was shouting that it was his room. As one girl calls the front desk the man is still in our room and wouldn't leave. The front desk simply said sorry mean while we were left to get the man out of our room. No one came to the room to help us. We were told to just pick up new keys when we returned. We had to demand to have our keys before leaving for our night out. If this all wasn't enough to never return, the next morning around around 9am another housekeeping staff walks into our room as my friend is getting out of the shower. (Do they not knock??) I will not return to this hotel. It is expensive approx.$260.00 for a very basic out dated room for a single night. Dirty as I experienced in March.

403795409,"This has to be by far one of the worst hotels I've ever stayed at.First of all, it is in the middle of downtown Vancouver surrounded by cannibas clinics, homeless people and and drug addicts. The hotel has ZERO security and these unsightly individuals can be seen running into the hotel and up the stairs at all hours of the day.  Upon entering the hotel, one of these homeless individuals threatened to kill the hotel staff trying to get him off the property.  The elevator security device is not functioning so anyone can enter the hotel and easily travel to all floors.We stayed here as part of a Gate One Tour to the Canadian Rockies. The hotel segregated the tour group during the breakfast time and we were not permitted to eat the regular buffet. We were served a horrible breakfast without yogurt and cereal. This was absolutely unacceptable as we are vegetarians and this is all we eat for breakfast. The staff had a rude and disrespectful attitude as well when we asked to remedy this situation.This hotel has a NON EXISTENT business center. When asked to use the computer we were directed to a malfunctioning computer in the hotel lobby. Every hotel guest had access to what you were typing on the computer. Privacy did not exist. This is absolutely a violation of privacy. The rooms were hideous with paintings that were vile.  The bathroom had gnats flying around it and they seemed to breed overnight. The toilet was so low to the floor and it was highly uncomfortable to use it. The beds were lumpy and we were not given extra blankets until the second night.   There was also bird poop on the window that was never cleaned during our stay. The gym and pool were located in a very unsafe and dangerous area of the hotel. You had to travel a few flights down a rickety old stairwell in order to access these areas. It is unsafe due to the lack of security at the hotel.Save your vacation and stay elsewhere.

Unfortunately, this resulted in guests who were partying on Granville and then returning to their rooms from 2-4am and continuing the party in their rooms and in the hallway.  Loud, drunk and what I assume to be hotel guests in their 20's were opening/slamming hotel doors, yelling in the hallway, going between rooms and opening the emergency exit doors and setting off the alarm.  We called the front desk and they did send someone promptly to address the guests.  And the guests did stay in their rooms for the most part after that, but unfortunately, we could still hear them through the walls.  We were placed in a room on the first floor.  And this is a good area to place guests who intend to be loud.  I just wish we weren't placed with them.

The hotel is located in a central area to the core downtown part of Vancouver.  But its definitely showing its age ... for example, the doors seem like they've been painted so many times, they can no longer close properly.  The bathrooms are teeny (like being in a European hotel!) where the bathroom and toilet practically hit each other.  The water pressure is quite weak. Getting around is a bit convoluted as there are a couple of sets of elevators and there is not a direct route from the parking garage to the reception area.  The cleaning was not up to par:  when I arrived there were multiple black hairs in the bathroom (definitely not mine as I'm blond) and even on my last day, they were STILL there, showing only superficial cleaning was being done.

576940213,"I rarely leave negative reviews. I always feel like there's pros and cons to each place I visit, but I try to focus on the positives. And let me preface this by saying I never actually stayed at this hotel.I booked this hotel for a 3 day weekend getaway to Quebec, Friday to Monday. Unfortunately, a snow storm cancelled my Friday night flight, so I was put on the first flight out Saturday morning. I immediately emailed the hotel to tell them I would not be coming and to feel free to give it away.Saturday, my flight took off and 10 minutes later, a door blew open and we had to return to the airport to get it fixed. We waited 7 hours until they finally said it could not be fixed. I went back and forth via email with the hotel a few times during this whole time to keep them updated and finally let them know we would not be coming at all. By this point, late Saturday afternoon, we decided to just cancel the trip, but not for lack of trying.The hotel told us we had to cancel on the site we booked it on, so I immediately called hotels.com and asked them to cancel the hotel room so we wouldn't get charged again. Hotels.com called the hotel and asked them to cancel it for us, and the hotel said they couldn't do that because we were technically mid-stay. So that was pointless. Not only that, they charged me for the whole trip that I didn't get to take.After 4 months of going back and forth with the hotel and credit card company, the hotel agreed to refund me for 2 nights and charge me for 1 night. So not only did I have to get a new hotel room at the original airport for Friday night to try to get to Quebec the next morning, I also paid for a hotel room in Quebec that I did not use. I lost a lot of money on a trip I never took.I feel like this is bad business practice and have explained over and over that I wasn't a no-show on purpose, and I kept in touch with them as soon as possible each time new information arose. They were free to re-rent the hotel room each night I told them I wouldn't be there. And due to winter in Canada and a large snow storm, I doubt the hotel was sold out and they weren't losing money.As a big business versus a single person, I definitely lost in this battle. The hotel probably lost nothing by not having anyone use water and electricity and not paying housekeeping, while I paid for double hotels, food, and transportation and spent my holiday at an airport. Both the hotel and American Express failed me on this trip. As someone who travels VERY often, I have never seen a hotel be so unreasonable.Because of their unwillingness to work with me, I wouldn't trust other aspects of this hotel. If anything in your plans change, you can count on Manoir Sur le Cap to fight you on everything. If you need anything while abroad in Canada, I would trust a bigger hotel with a better reputation. Unfortunately, I like to stay at boutique hotels and give the little guys business, but this time I got burned by that.Last thought: think twice about booking with a hotel that so strongly feels their rules are the last word and extenuating circumstances mean the customer is wrong!",-1,2,0.463321834

When I came back he had lunch all over his hands and wrote charged up the wrong amount on my card. He had no refrence that I had already paid part of the total amount. I could have stayed at a much better hotel say the Delta for the $180 per night they charged for the Roy room. The room was tired and grubby. The fridge did not work.

409368234,"I am so dissatisfied with the experience here that I'm writing this review while still staying last night at the hotel, so let me begin. The hotel is situated on a quaint street in the lower town, and the room 31 is quite spacious and nice - that's where the one star goes to. The rest of experience was very negative. The hotel claims to be a four start hotel - not true. It does not offer anything except room, breakfast and a front desk. Not even a bell man, you'd have to get you bags over the step to get inside and into the elevator. You are also given the parking permit to take the car two blocks down and park yourself for 16CAD/night - fine with me, just don't call it a four star hotel. I found it puzzling when the receptionist charged my credit card for the whole stay and incidentals - usually it's just the incidentals, then you pay at the end of your stay. After first room cleaning, I had to call the reception and ask them to replenish toiletries - you'd think cleaners would figure that out seeing empty shower gel container. First morning we came down to have breakfast, turned out it was a typical Marriott Courtyard breakfast - cereals, jams, yogurt, some fruits, bread, potatoes, scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon. Not a four star breakfast again but OK, manageable. Well, turned out all protein was pork. So if you are jewish or muslim, you feel a bit of left out. Asked the staff if there was any protein they could add to the buffet next day - anything but pork. The girls at the reception seemed to be nice about it and in the next hour informed us of visiting nearby market and buying some sliced turkey and chicken sausages specifically for us as &quot;the hotel welcomes guests requests and trying to accommodate them to make guests' stay pleasurable&quot;. I found it interesting that receptionists had to do the shopping but seemed that our small request was addressed. Next morning we had 8 sausages and a plate of duck pate brought to our table :). The following morning, however, when we asked to check with the kitchen, the waitress seemed confused and started avoiding us. To make a long story short, everything was cancelled and my wife had a very interesting conversation with the hotel manager, Mr. Franchet. He was very straight forward with her and let her know that he had to discipline the receptionists for their initiative, pork is Quebec experience, and he would not let the guests make their own rules. After a short speech he all of a sudden lost his English speaking abilities, so the conversation wounded down quickly. So absolute lack of respect and very poor customer service leaves me no choice but to suggest avoiding this hotel as there are many other beautiful hotels in the city where you can be treated with respect, especially considering that you pay for your stay from your own pocket. And Le Priory rates are not much different from the hotels of the same class in the vicinity to use this as an argument.Lastly, room 31 is a beautiful room, however facing the backyard and restaurant patio, so don't count on going to bed earlier than midnight after all restaurant guests are gone and dishes are cleaned from the table.",-1,1,0.489565217

3704596,"Going off reviews on Tripadvisor, we booked this hotel for a two-night stay.  We ended up staying no more than an hour, and most of that was spent trying to get across to the staff that there were a number of issues.The first was the smell.  Our room smelled dirty ... that unmistakable odor of unwashed bodies leaving their evidence behind.  Secondly, the room was dirty, with glass marks on what passed for a desk, filthy light-switches and dried urine dribbles on the floor of the bathroom.  As if that were not enough, the a/c sounded like a toilet whose water wouldn't stop running.  The desk clerk refused to accept that the room was dirty, couldn't identify the smell and told us that the noise was not from the a/c but from a neighboring room running the shower ... coincidentally several times, exactly when the a/c came on.   I am a travel agent and have travelled widely, staying in all sorts of hotels, from the priciest to small, privately-owned establishments, but this is only the second time in years of world travel that I've felt I really had to leave a hotel immediately.

425375597,"Had high hopes for this genteel hotel, instead was sucker-punched right off the bat.  The public rooms, lobby, shops, restaurants were lovely and in character for the type of hotel. Our room (and I had anticipated small, so no big deal) was so dim that I had to squint.  It was not tiny (a plus) but, oh my, the lighting was just awful.  Our window faced another building across the courtyard.  It was embarrassing that someone, on that side actually waved to me!!  The water view was on the other side and the hotel told us there were no rooms available at the time. The bathroom WAS tiny, tiny, tiny and so poorly lit that a woman would be unable to apply makeup..... despite the magnifying mirror supplied.  I had to stand inside an almost closed CLOSET in order to put on makeup as that light was almost sufficient.  Absurd.  The bathroom sink would not hold water and, as I later found out from people in our group, their sinks did not hold water either.  Some were using the ice bucket in the sink to shave!!  It was, as the room, bare bones. Just the requisite bottles of lotion, shampoo, etc.  For the cost, I would have thought a basket of potpourri, at least!   I've seen better appointed rooms and bathrooms in Best Westerns!!!  Granted, you only sleep in the room, but as it turned out, I spent a lot of time there.  I went to explore the City not realizing it was so hilly (BE AWARE), and due to a back condition, was unable to navigate.  If you have a back issue, there is nothing flat within walking distance.  I read many books in my incredibly dimly lit room.There was no refrigerator in the room and that was a disappointment.  There was NO drawers for your clothing, shirts, sweaters, pants........just a few 'cubby' type drawers large enough for ONE handbag or a pair of pajamas or underwear or charging cords.  And, of course, a closet.  Very disappointing.  Also, I had to call Housekeeping to bring an ironing board! I had an iron, but no board, and had to wait until one arrived.  Also not impressed with attitude.  I asked for iced tea, more than once, only to be told 'NO'.  I would then ask for hot tea and a glass of ice, and would receive it.  But, the first answer to my requests were usually met with 'NO'.  They were not the accommodating type of staff I am used to.  Will not put this Hotel on our 'go back again' list.",-1,9,0.428943452

436209823,"I stayed with the hotel the 5th and 6th of November, room 6127.The booking process was very smooth and friendly. I was very pleased to see that nearly every person who I spoke with at the hotel was very bilingual (I speak both English and French).That said, here is an outline of the issues we had.Upon arrival we had to wait in the front lobby for over half an hour to be seen by an agent at the desk. There must have been 40 people in the lobby, but only one counter open for check-ins. Finally after a few people complained to another staff member, they brought in another agent to open the second counter. Our room was not ready yet (which did not bother me, as I had planned to walk around the area that afternoon) so we were able to leave our bags with the concierge while we were waiting. However, the concierge was nowhere to be found. Another 15-20minutes of waiting at the concierge desk, along with another dozen visitors before the concierge arrived. There needs to be more staff available during what was obviously a peak check-in time.The hotel was supposed to call my telephone to let us know when the room was available. Nobody called us. We returned around 4PM and asked if the room was ready, and indeed it was. At this point we had no extra time for anything as we had a supper rendezvous for 5PM. Once we checked into the room, I was immediately disappointed in what I saw.NOTE: I will not complain when I receive a room in poor condition! I do not (and did not) have time to play games and waste time to move arrangements to a different room etc. The hotel has ONE chance to get this right, and if they don't, I am not impressed. I will not make a scene at the hotel, or demand a change (We did not have time for this anyway as we had a previous engagement). I did not have the time or patience to &quot;discuss the matter&quot; with senior staff. Again, as a hotel, they have one chance to get this right. The room we received was indeed advertised as newly renovated, and indeed it was worked on somewhat recently (Maybe a year ago from the looks). But it was very poorly maintained. Below are the issues:1) Dust - The room was very dusty. Everywhere. There was never any effort done to dust the furniture in what appears to be a couple weeks, as there were marks from past visitors where they had put items on the table/cabinet etc. 2) Paint scratched and scuffed along all of the moldings, walls, and especially near the window and heater. I am not sure what happened near the heater assembly, but the walls around it and the window were especially scratched and dented etc, which leads me to the next point...3) Entire molding MISSING under the heater, leaving a massive HOLE in the wall. I was able to completely fit my arm in this hole! I don't know what exactly happened here. But the molding was missing entirely, as well as the trim work around it was cracked and broken.4) Dents in the walls from door handles. You can see that there were doorstops installed AFTER they realized the door handles hit the walls. But they didn't fix the original markings. 5) Clock not working (battery dead).6) Telephone had voicemail notification for messages we could not retrieve. (My guess is that this was the past guest that they did not remove?)7) Television bracket did not hold the TV properly. Always angled up towards the ceiling no matter how much you adjust it. 8) Stupidly overpriced items left in the room. $9.00 for a bottle of water, unacceptable. Worse is every bottle in the fridge and on the counter has a sensor underneath it that automatically charges the room when you lift them up. Reading the label on the $9.00 bottle of water causes it to be charged to your room! There is a warning label for this on the fridge, but the lighting is so bad in the room, you can't really read it and it just appears to be a general safety warning label. Luckily a call to the front desk sorted this without any questions; otherwise our bill would have been much higher.I have included pictures of the various issues in the room.The next morning, we were scheduled to have breakfast in the dining room. Upon arrival at the entrance to the dining room, there must have been 2 dozen people standing around waiting aimlessly. So we decided to wait as well. Upon arriving at the door/counter, we were informed we needed to &quot;check in&quot; first, and wait to be called. So we wasted half an hour standing around for nothing. We left and had breakfast at a wonderful bistro down the street instead. After complaining about this to the front desk, they admitted that the current system is a little strange, and there is no indication of this so that you can make arrangements ahead of time. They refunded the breakfast component on my bill, but almost seemed confused why a huge wait can be a problem.---------------------------------------In conclusion, they missed the mark. I don't expect much in a hotel room... But I expect what they have in place is in pristine condition. If the clock is there, it needs to be working. If the room is advertised as newly renovated, there are no excuses for marks on the walls and holes in the walls. I expect the room to be maintained and cleaned properly. I have stayed in countless hotels and I have seen better room maintenance in a Holiday Inn. The past 5 &quot;budget&quot; hotels I have used in other cities all had their rooms up to the proper standards, so this was clearly a disappointment from a hotel that apparently prides itself on quality and luxury. The price was almost triple what I would be expected to pay for the same style of room in a different hotel, which I do not mind, provided the quality and workmanship is there. It was not in this case.",-1,6,0.446570467
461849389,"We spent the first two evenings of a honeymoon here. It was a disappointing start.We chose Quebec City specifically to stay at the Frontenac. I had seen a photo and was desperate to go. It is an incredible building, in a beautiful setting. Truly it is one of the most beautiful places I have ever visited. The boardwalk around is is stunning. The weather was sunny and warm and perfect in May. The nearby restaurants are fantastic.The public spaces are grand, but limited. The entrance foyer is an impressive space. There doesn't seem to be anywhere to pass the time though. It was a beautiful space to walk through, and we got the impression that was it. The room itself was small and comfortable, but no different from an average Marriott or Hilton hotel. The view to the inner courtyard was okay, and the windows were dirty. The thing that let it down was the incredible penny-pinching cheapness. Everything had an extortionate price tag, including a bottle of water set out on the counter - over a button rigged to charge you if you pick it up. It's not a cheap hotel to visit, and it doesn't seem to be struggling for guests. It's mystifying why they would be so miserly and inhospitable. It's at odds with the grandeur of the building, and ends up giving off a Disneyland vibe (without the magic).The service was poor and minimal. Check-in was impersonal, check-out was impersonal. We set off straight after our wedding finished, travelled over 12 hours and arrived here to a stone face of resigned disinterest. (As one half of a gay couple, I couldn't help but wonder that maybe we just wouldn't receive the same honeymoon experience, but our other hotels on the trip proved that wasn't the case). When you see how long the corridors are, it becomes obvious that you're just another number. It was the least friendly service we received in Quebec. We were relieved that our travel agent had muddled up the booking and had to move us to the Auberge St Antoine down the hill for the rest of the week. The upside to the hotel is the swimming pool.

My wife placed her earrings on the coffee table, and left them in the room on day 2 and when we packed up to leave the following morning we observed that they were missing.

For that reason, I usually like to splurge on boutique luxury hotels that promise wonderful service and a 5-star experience. Fairmont Frontenac unfortunately did not meet expectations. 1 - The shower water pressure is AWFUL! good luck washing shampoo out if you have long hair (we stayed in 2 rooms - more on that later - and the water pressure was equally bad in both). 2 - The walls in the room are paper-thin. We flew in at 11pm on weeknight, after a full day at work, and fell asleep immediately, only to be woken every hour by conversations in other rooms AND what sounded like a group of people partying (loud music until after 5am). Security never came by until we called at 5:30 am (music had been blasting for a few hours at that point).  The front desk kindly moved us to a new room for the remainder of our stay. 3 - Rooms are shabbily outfitted. On the last day we had a towel with a GIANT 6inch whole in it. What??! Also, only 1 robe in the room. 4 - $16/day for Wifi - coming from the States and having travelled all over Europe and Asia, i was accustomed to having free Wifi in luxury hotels.5 - slow service from bell hops (i think they are understaffed)Once you walk into the lobby, the hotel feels like a chaotic Disney World, packed with sightseers and disoriented travelers.

When we mentioned the tub at checkout, we were ignored. It was overpriced.  After checking out we waited 45 minutes for our car to be brought around.  The staff opted to help incoming clients first.I recommend finding a place near the Fairmont, down hill even because the area was great fun in the snow!",-1,1,0.506388889

I spoke with the front desk and they told me that the only thing they could do for us was to switch our room to the fairmont room with a slightly better view of the river. Now this was not very accommodating because the fairmont room was about $150 USD cheaper than the Deluxe Room. They said they could not refund the price difference because it was booked online through a travel website. She told me that was the best they could do, which is very hard to believe. She could have offered to credit our account towards a meal or parking or something but they obviously did not want to resolve the issue at the expense of the hotel but tried to resolve it at the expense of the visitor.

For beginners, this may have been due to the busy season, but there was literally no room to walk in the lobby. While we understand that tourists love to visit as well, there should be a  way for guests to have a peaceful check-in even in peak season. When we got to our suite we were in for more disappointment, primarily the bathroom. It was the size of a closet, and there was still hair in the tub. Not what I would expect at a Fairmont property. The breakfast was pathetically limited for vegetarians or even egg-atarians. In most other properties I've stayed at, the Chefs are almost always happy to make something to order so that a family doesn't have to eat only toast and croissants - this was not the case here.

We booked four nights, two rooms, my family of four plus two in-laws. We checked out after one night. When we arrived the hotel entrance was swamped with teenagers ( about 150), apparently having their prom. We got no bell service, which made it difficult to navigate with kids and luggage. My in-laws got bell service only to wait and wait for their bags. After three calls to the room we finally had to walk down to the lobby to identify their bags. Then they were given attitude by the bellman.

The room was tiny, with low water pressure, and one drawer plus two half drawers to put all your stuff. They have one liter Evian water bottles in the room for $8.50, $16 per day WiFi, just, basically, nicked and dimed the crap out of us.

267239911,"What an awful experience. A few tips for youâ¦if you are so unfortunate as to find yourself dining here.  Tip #1: Do not ask for a seat by the window. Tip #2 Do not ask for a full bodied dry wine under $100.  Tip #3 DO NOT go anywhere near the cheese display. I have never felt so un-welcomed in any establishment ever. The restaurant staff we encountered were clearly too good to be serving the likes of us! We certainly exceeded the dress code but none the lessâ¦received awful service. 1st mistake- donât bother asking for a table by the window. The Maitre Dâ did all she could not to scoff at our request. She indicated that such an enviable table would have to be reserved WELL in advance. Shut down- weâll just sit at the table you assigned us. No worries! Weâll still enjoy our evening that weâve been looking forward to for weeks. It was after all- meant to be the highlight of our trip! Not. 2nd mistake- expecting a decently thought out wine pairing. We asked for a dry red wine reccoâ¦something âreasonable.â Incredulously- the waiter says so âsomething around $100?â Awkward. No- something more reasonable? Waiter re-appears with 3 bottles of very chilled red wines. Weâve selected the dry option per the waiterâs recco. The waiter pours a paltry tasting portion (only for my husbandâ¦b/c after all itâs still the 1800âs at Le Chateau!). Wine was cold and barely enough to taste. Reluctantly we settled for the wine â hoping that once it warmed up a bit it would be better. Wrong. It was sweet &amp; a terrible choice for prime rib. The waiter somewhat redeemed himself by bringing us a better choice of wine. Too little, to late though. 3rd mistake- the beautiful cheese display on a marble table at the entrance to the resto (the one with the doors that automatically glide open when you stand anywhere near the sensor? Yup that display). Do not go in there. Do not attempt to sample one of the 50 tiny cubes of cheese displayed on tasting spoons.  While we ate, I saw a number of other patrons enter this room so i figured it was fine to check it out. Don't do it! You will be escorted out haughtily by the maÃ®tre dâ. But only after she screams âExcuse Me! That is NOT for tasting!!!â I havenât wandered in from the street- we just spent a few hundred dollars in your establishmentâ¦and the door opens automaticallyâ¦and there is an assortment of tiny cheeses laid out and no sign that says âemployeesâ or any such indication that patrons were not to enter.  I can think of a few thousand ways to approach such a situation and none of them involve shrieking at the door over a 1 cent piece of cheese. Get a grip maÃ®tre dâ!  Oh and a tip for you &amp; your precious cheese...take the motion sensor off the door &amp; put up a sign that says &quot;employees only&quot; or &quot;not for tasting&quot; so you don't have to lose your shi t escorting people out all day. Maybe get a new job too- seems you hate this job! Le Chateau - Snobbery at it's finest.

We spoke to Rodolfo on Reception the first day about our disappointment with the room who after much deliberation agreed to move us on the second day to a room on the third floor, which overlooked a courtyard.

I made the reservation directly with the hotel via phone and spent a considerable amount of time with the staff person figuring out the best room/suite for our family (two adults and two kids, ages 10 and 14).  I decided on the 007 Suite (James Bond), a one of a kind, suite with original historic details and private entrance, which I knew my kids would love.  I received a confirmation which I printed and brought with us. At check-in I was told that we were being upgraded to one of their renovated suites in the new part of the hotel.  I saw the expressions on my children's faces.  I thanked the front-desk person and said we would like to stay in the original 007 Suite which I had booked and showed my printed reservation confirmation.  At this point, I was told it wasn't available.   I was perplexed -- I had a confirmed reservation for this one-of-a kind suite, yet it was given away to another guest.  They brought us up to show us the room they were offering us which was fine -  renovated but nothing special - no views, etc.  I asked to see another room, something with a terrace or view or other original detail, and was shocked to be told &quot;this is the only room we have left&quot;.  So basically, I am being told take this room or there's nothing here for you.  Since we were exhausted after an 8 hour drive from NYC, we took it... but not happily.  I went downstairs to speak to the front desk manager, who, sensing my anger and frustration at how we were being treated, threw in free parking, free breakfast for one morning and gave us an 8% discount off the room rate.The day we were departing, I asked to meet with the GM, Mr. Sauman.  I told him about our situation and what had transpired upon check-in.  I was absolutely shocked when he said &quot;yes, I heard about what happened and wasn't happy about it&quot;.  We stayed at the hotel for four days, three nights and he knew what happened to our reservation, yet never bothered to reach out - to apologize, to offer something -- nothing. He also seemed confused by why his staff said the room they offered us was the only one available.  According to him, that wasn't the case.  As we were packing to go, I received a call from the front desk telling me Mr. Sauman would like to see my family before we left.  I had assumed he would offer to us a complimentary night, or invite us back for a free stay another time.  Boy was I wrong.  As we were leaving the hotel, he approached us and looked at my kids and said &quot;sorry about the situation&quot; and handed us four bottles of water and some cookies.As this is a Relais and Chateaux property, I am appalled at how we were treated, and even more furious knowing the GM knew of our situation during our stay but never bothered to contact us.  And then to hand us water and cookies.  An absolute insult.My 10 year old asked me what I thought happened to the suite I had booked.  I said it was probably given to another family.  He said âmaybe to a family the hotel thought was specialâ.  I explained that every person/family should be made to feel special when they are staying at a hotel like the Auberge Saint-Antoine.  Sadly, this didnât include my family.",-1,0,0.626986423

The staff wasn't well-trained and we weren't advised of small things which could've made the trip a lot better. It's not our job to track down information regarding breakfast. No one bothered to tell us that we didn't have to eat the mediocre food in the breakfast area; instead, we had the option of going to the on-site restaurant. There were several other mis-steps, but mostly, the staff didn't accommodate us to a king, as we had expected, and thought we signed up for. I'd save your money and try another hotel.

Told that it would be ready sometime in the afternoon which is not acceptable as we need to get ready for a wedding. Manager is not available to speak to. Next were told the room is on a priority list for cleaning however they cannot say when it will be ready. After pushing  we were told they could have in ready in 45 minutes.

605151115,"This really should be illegal. It's illegal in the USA but I guess that it's permitted to discriminate in Canada. I am outraged. After having stayed at this hotel twice before, and giving it good reviews, I have encountered an unbelievable situation. I made a reservation for two rooms, and when making the reservation, I made it clear that it was absolutely necessary for the two rooms to be on the same floor and near enough to each other that my elderly mother could easily walk between them. This was a condition of the reservation. The next day, I received an insulting email calling me &quot;madame&quot; and saying that they would not guarantee that the rooms would be on the same floor and within easy walking distance, and they warned me that the penalty for cancelling within 14 days would be the full charge of both rooms for all 3 nights. It is more than 2 weeks before our arrival date.  I responded accordingly, reminding them that the reservation was made with the requirement of the rooms being on the same floor and close by. The hotel's response to my email was to cancel our reservation. It seems that they do not permit senior citizens who need to be near their caretaker to stay in their hotel. I find this completely outrageous. It is discriminatory. It should be illegal. Shame on Hotel Auberge Saint-Antoine! Anyone who would like written documentation of this discrimination can contact me through tripadvisor",-1,1,0.541304348

The front desk said that our view would be beautiful; Not really. The location of the hotel was convenient for us to sightsee and tour around. Although reviews said it was wonderful I was quite disappointed with quality. The bathroom had a whirlpool but it looked old. The sink was like a lab sink from high school which splashed every where when we used it. The shower was small and the tiles were old; not old fashioned but old and cheap looking. The side tables were so small it barely held anything but the cheap telephone and the $1 alarm clock.

I booked a room with a Jacuzzi (thinking that it would be a real jacuzzi for more then one person), we arrived at 1 am and we were looking forward to relaxing in the jacuzzi before going to bed.  We walk into our room, and our jacuzzi is actually a bathtub with added jets.  I was so disappointed and angry. I went to see the front desk and the guy there barely spoke any English and told us there's nothing he could do for us, all we could do is wait and speak to the manager the next morning.  The next morning I went to see the manager, who kept telling me &quot;we never guaranteed a jacuzzi&quot;...I explained to him that their website says specifically uses the word &quot;JACUZZI&quot;, so then he tells me &quot;OH..I'm sorry, we used the wrong term&quot;.  I was so frustrated at this time.  He tried to make me feel better by offering me a $30 discount on the room.  I said to him &quot;I am paying $180/night for a regular room, when I could have gotten the same room at a much cheaper price somewhere else and that the only reason I booked with you is because of the Jacuzzi&quot;.  At the end of a long discussion, I asked him to give us another night free to compensate.  He agreed and gave us their &quot;economy&quot; room...it was so small and it didn't even have a bathtub.  Just a small shower that I (being 5ft) could barely move around in it.OH...and they billed me for parking when I was specifically told it was going to be free with the room.In conclusion, the hotel is not that great.

The owner seemed nice and spoke a little bit of English, and it was a rainy summer evening, so we decided to take our chances on the basement room offered. Big mistake. The ceilings are about 68 inches so we both fit, and the room was cramped with poor light, but we are from NYC so we can deal with a less than ideal living space for one night-- as long as it is clean. There is a garden outside the window, and within an hour of arriving, we noticed bugs all over the carpet. They were something between roaches and ants, and probably harmless and had come in because of the torrential rain, but we went upstairs and got the manager. He understood some of what we said and came down to look-- agreeing that there were bugs and killing some of them with his keys, then putting the keys in the door. We asked for a different room at the same price, and he said he'd be happy to refund our money if we decided to leave (we'd only been there an hour!) but he would not give us another room and asked we please make a decision quickly. We walked around in the rain for over an hour looking for another place that was still open and we could afford that would take us and have parking for our rental car. We luckily found a beautiful room a couple blocks away, though it was more expensive, but the whole experience was very uncomfortable and a waste of time, and we were very wet by the time of evening we finally found something.",-1,1,0.537375479
7237598,"Whatever you do, do not book a room in the basement! We booked the room based on a friend's recommendation, the cheap rate and tripadvisor reviews, but we really wished we hadn't bothered. What an awful experience! The basement stinks of mold or mildew, I bought air freshener, which didn't help. We kept the doors open as much as possible, which doesn't feel like the right thing to do in a hotel!  I had to move the fan to try to get some air circulating from the tiny windows, which are located right at the level of passerbyers feet. Every time someone stops to look at the hotel or take a photo, they stop in front of the window, which you have to leave open because of the smell, which is creepy enough when you just see their legs and feet, but even worse they bend down and try to peer into your room! Anyway, when the housekeeper cleaned the room, she just moved the fan back anyway. I couldn't bear to touch the nasty carpet with my bare feet, the room was decorated like a 1970s rec room, with exactly the kind of wooden bed I had as a kid, complete with the mattress with loud, squeky springs sticking into my back.  I barely slept the first night, partially because of the car headlights shining through the window every time a car drove by, but also because of the uncomfortable bed and the smell. The bathroom is ridiculously tiny: I am 4'10, and my boyfriend is 5'3, we could neither turn around confortably in the bathroom nor even sit on the toilet without the banging into the sink that hangs over you. The staff were very eccentric, I don't know if I would call them charming, like other reviewers. Moody yes, weird yes, but warm? Definitely not. The breakfast was fine, but served on a strange and tiny balcony at sidewalk level, which you had to climb through a window/door in the lobby to get to. The hotel was neither clean nor well-maintained, and the basement is like entering a foul-smelling time warp.

The first floor is pleasant, and peeking in at the lodgings across from the office, those accomodations looked much like the pictures on the website.

However, we stayed in 3 rooms on the 2nd and 3rd floors over a 6-day period, and each was awful in its own way. None of these rooms are pictured on the hotel's website. They were all shabby and dingy, with uncomfortable beds and dirty floors. In one, the bathroom smelled of mold and the floor was squishy, so we kept the baqthrrom door shut at all times. The room was equipped with a room air-conditioner which we turned on in an attempt to air the room out. When we returned a few hours later, the exhaust hose had been blown into the room by a stiff wind off the St. Lawrence. We were in a sauna! In another room, which had a kitchen, a sign  informed us that if we left any dirty dishes we would be charged $20. Fair enough, but there was no dish soap or other cleaning supplies, and wondering a little how previous guests had managed to clean their dishes, we opted not to use the kitchen.

584279328,"Rarely (see my 300+ other reviews) have I stayed in a hotel, where almost everything was wrong.Let's start with the design of the room. This has probably been done by someone who never slept in a hotel in his or her life. There is no central (or any) light-switch reachable from the bed. The built-in mini-safe is right above the mini-bar, in a cabinet that doesn't have air vents. Consequently the contents of the safe, p.ex. the iPad, get heated up to dangerous temperatures. The voucher euphemistically titled &quot;Raid the Bar&quot; and handed out to IHG Platinum Members covers just the price of a beer. And that's about all the recognition you get. Forget late-check out (meaning just 2 p.m.) as &quot;the hotel is full&quot; (over the IHG-App rooms could still be booked for the very day) And the filth! The carpet is filthy. By whiping over the hard-surfaced part of the room's floor with a wet-wipe, the latter comes out black (see attached pic) and the bathing towels seem to have had a previous life somewhere else.The public &quot;Roof-Top-Restaurant&quot; can only be accessed by using the hotel's evelevators serving the guest-floors, without any restrictions for anyone to wander about - a clear security risk to the guests.Speaking about the restaurant: The menu is described as &quot;delivering vibrant, classic American dishes&quot;. In plain English this means there is nothing buy a single measly steak, a few salads and a hamburger. Why they need an &quot;Executive Chef&quot; for that remains a mystery, because any fast-food joint does is better.In addition there are bread-crums all over the floor from the previous night, as the restaurant opens for breakfast, the &quot;hot&quot; items of the breakfast are served on cold plates, the &quot;easy-over&quot; egg is rather &quot;heavy-over&quot;, i.e. concrete-like and the wooden pepper and salt shakers are greasy and unhygienic.

400005913,"Upon checking in on July 23, 2016, we were met by Kim, our first brush with Kimpton hotels, the ambassador to their name brand. Immediately, she made us feel unimportant and &quot;cheap&quot; by crudely referencing the American Express Platinum Card offering which provides 1 free day after 3 paid days. My wife and I travel quite often, and as such encounter all manner of individuals, thus we simply ignored this behavior and set off to our room. Perhaps it was a mistake, but Kim failed to advise us that our original room, 602 was literally outside the elevator, and a necessary waystation en route to the Roof. Thus, until well past 1:00am, we enduring the incessant &quot;ding&quot; of the elevator, and the augmented, alcohol-enhanced voices of the guests. Of the two elevators, one of them was inoperable throughout the weekend of our stay. The next morning, we requested that our room be moved, and, in a step in the right direction, this was accommodated.Cesar performed the move, and commented upon a red neck airline flight pillow that had a small lobster affixed thereto by velcro as well as a zip tie. Strangely enough, this is important information which will be addressed below.The new room was quite nice, but I noticed that it, and nearly every single surface at the hotel was stained, scuffed, scratched or damaged in some fashion. The tables at the Roof were rickety and sticky, the cheap tile flooring was stained, the grout had turned black from filth long ago and easily 30% of the tiles were chipped in some large or small fashion. The bar is a disaster in all respects, down to the two cracked garnishment boxes. The fruit that was served was well past its prime and at no time did I observe a time when the fire pit area was not otherwise filthy, stained and littered. However, there was good entertainment by a certain guest soliciting the favor of two ladies, while he drunkenly splashed around in the puddle that they call a pool. Of course, if that drunk were not available, one could always relax to the jarring screams and colorful cursing being streamed from the kitchen, all for the customers to overhear.While present on the property, we had sought spa services: manicure, pedicure, massage. We were told by Kim that there were no manicure/pedicure services and the massage would take place in our bedroom. As to the former, Kim refused to make any recommendations for such a service complete with an arrogant sniff and eye roll to follow. As to the suggestion that the massage take place in the bedroom, it had a decidedly seedy feel to it which we declined. We had been using taxi's from the hotel, until last Wednesday, when Kim failed to call the taxi company, and we - quite stupidly - waited around for a car. As we were on a strict schedule, every minute was important to us. Ultimately, we called Uber for a ride, which appeared after 6 minutes, but that was only after Kim attempted to put me on the phone with the taxi company in an effort to cover up her ineptitude. Wednesday was a particularly exciting day, because that was when we learned that the velcroed, zip-tied lobster had been stolen from the room. Management made no effort whatsoever to address this burglary, as silly as it seems. Nonetheless, a personal item was unlawfully removed from our room.I should point out that while we had a car present, and paid $38.00 a day for it, not one single time when we called for the vehicle was it promptly brought up. In addition, the valet failed to answer the phone 50% of the time we called. Further, on the day that we left, the valet present (name unknown) intermittently glanced up from the game on his phone to blankly watch us load the luggage into the car. It would have been nice had the valet actually served as a valet (obviously for which he would have been compensated).In summary, it is my opinion that the Wilshire is a filthy, scarred, overpriced hostel with no amenities of any legitimate desire. The bar has not seen a cleaning product in an age, the pool is actually a reflection pool only with depth markers masquerading otherwise, and the fire pit area's seating is curiously stained and has enough aged, strewn about cigarette butts to wallpaper a small room. The front desk services, captained by Kim were marked by rudeness, snideness, arrogance and derision. Our room was burglarized - granted the item was small, but given that the scofflaw had to cut the ziptie and remove the lobster from the velcro, it can only have been an intentional act to convert my property. And the valet utterly failed to discharge his duties.I was thoroughly disgusted with the hotel, and have given this review particular attention in the hopes that I am properly expressing the same.  Hopefully, Kimpton will take to heart what I have written and hopefully travelers will be wary of doctored pictures. Giving the place one star is too much. inadequate. Far more important is that I, who sit firmly in your demographic as a desired guest, intend to convey to my wide circle of friends and colleagues, who will likely inquire of my time, of the experiences that I encountered. It is my firm intention to regale my colleagues in painstaking detail each of the aforementioned experiences, as well as other criticisms that are far too numerous to list here but were a part of our trip.",-1,2,0.506627673
353027320,"We stayed for a single night as a family. Previously have lived in LA for 9 years.We had booked a room for 5 people, 2 adults and 3 children. We knew it was going to be bit squashy but that was an understatement. For the price the room was small. It also backed onto the parking lot and there was a super bright light on all night that the blinds didn't really block out.The pullout bed was not out and there was no linen to even make it. We didn't have enough towels for all of us either. When we asked about the pullout, the linen was dropped off (bed not made). The rooftop bar and breakfast was good however with good views. The front desk staff were disinterested and at one stage I watched a lady struggling at the front door and the staff just watched her. I actually opened the door for her instead. They were not that far away but did not make a move.",-1,0,0.495634921
384355458,"I make nearly monthly trips to LA for business and thought I discovered a gem at Hotel Wilshire. My first experience at Hotel Wilshire was warm, inviting and enjoyable. It only lasted 18 hours as I stayed overnight and headed out the following morning. There wasn't enough time to experience how flawed the gem actually is. During my first trip I was awarded some type of &quot;Guest of the Day&quot; at check in which meant I received a slightly nicer room, bottle of wine and a fruit platter. Great way to start. I dropped my bags, went to my meetings, came back exhausted, slept and headed to the airport. Great experience. My second trip and most recent has been a comedy of errors, poor service and clear flaws in all aspects of Hotel Wilshire. The hotel is NOISY. For approximately $400/night I expect a reasonable amount of insulation between rooms, hallways and street noise. None exists or at least none that dampens any noise. Neighbors are clearly heard, similar to what I'd expect from a cheap motel. The check in experience this time was hectic, cold and misleading. I received an email the day of my arrival offering to upgrade my room for a nominal fee. When I clicked through it said I couldn't upgrade the day of arrival (why send it to me the DAY OF ARRIVAL then?) so I asked at the check in. The less than interested front desk rep Caesar wasn't sure how to handle it, went to the back office to ask a manager and then said he could upgrade me in accordance with the offer in the email but that I had to act fast because they were getting occupied quickly. I wasn't interested in pressure tactics to upsell me and I asked to see the difference between the upgraded room (for the additional charge of course) and the booked room. Caesar brought me to see two rooms that seemed similar but one that was slightly larger. I decided to go with the smaller and what was represented as the standard room. As we got back downstairs I'm told that we saw two upgraded rooms and that I could have other of those for a substantial upgrade fee. Confusion ensued, I choose a true standard room and then the excitement begins. As I wrote earlier, the hotel is NOISY and my room was no exception. Making matters worse was absolutely zero reception in the hotel room on my AT&amp;T cell phone. I told Kim at the front desk this and she graciously said they would work to find me another room. As I left for the evening Kim told me that another room was available and to let them know when I'd be back. I ended up back later that evening after dinner and after waiting on line at the front desk to change rooms for what felt like an eternity wound up going back upstairs to try to get some sleep. 2am rolls around and the room phone rings and rings. I try to ignore it once but the phone continues so I answer and am greeted with a command barked at me &quot;This is the front desk, what is your last name?&quot; It's literally 2am, I've been asleep for hours and I am being barked at. This is a surreal hotel experience. I asked the callers name, &quot;Drew&quot; and then why he needs to know my last name, after all he should have access to the computer system if he's actually at the front desk. He tells me that he has this room in his system as vacant and that if I don't tell him my last name he will come upstairs to the room. Shocked and wishing I had a way to keep a record of this call I tell him my last name, say goodnight and go back to sleep.  I bring up this issue to Annie, the manager at the front desk the next day who apologizes, offers me a small F&amp;B credit, upgrades my room and we move on. Onward with the comedy of errors. I am getting ready one morning and I hear a noise from the bathroom. Inside the large bathroom mirror has fallen off from the wall and is being held up and stopped from shattering by the faucet for the sink. The original installation and the method of attachment of the mirror to the wall are clearly flawed. The large bathroom mirror that could have easily killed someone is hanging by a thread.  I go for an entire day without a bathroom mirror as they decide how to repair it. Just another one of the reasons Iâm not going back to this place. A picture of this mirror incident is also attached. As I was looking for photos to place along with this review I remembered another problem. The throw pillow that came on the bed had blood (maybe chocolate) stains all over it. Really gross and shows how little attention they pay to hygiene and detail at this property. A picture of this is attached to the review. I began this review nearly 2 months ago and thought I would let the review sit as I cooled off about this bad experience. Iâve been back to LA 6 times since on business, not once staying in this hotel. I have no plans to stay here again and would absolutely NOT recommend this place other than to go to the rooftop pool for a drink at most.",-1,2,0.380397843
384338578,"I stayed in a suite with sofa area, large bathroom and a bedroom with 2 queen beds, called The Mulholland.  When I first walked in I could tell that the rooms had not been vacuumed properly.  There were 4 very long black hairs on the sofa and throughout the suite.  There were also small pieces of paper and fabric in the carpet.  I called the front desk and the Housekeeping manager came to my room within 10 minutes and vacuumed the whole area.  He also used a fabric roller on the sofa.  I took a shower before going out to my event that evening.  The shower was very nice with great shampoo, conditioner and body wash.  There was an engraved sign (see photo) warning guests not to turn the shower handle past the OFF designation and that it could be expected that the shower would drip for a few minutes.  When I returned back from my event at 11pm, the shower still had a steady stream of dripping.  I called the front desk and was told that , &quot;The engineers are gone for the day.&quot;  I countered by saying that since there was the engraved sign, this dripping was a known problem and that the hotel should be able to handle it 24/7.  Again I was told that the engineers were gone for the day. The only way I would go back to the hotel for anything would be to visit the open air restaurant, The Roof on the top of the hotel.  The view is super fantastic and the food very good. A very nice place to go with friends!",-1,1,0.503778468
133263273,"For the really high price, great photos, and wonderful sounding descriptions, we thought we were in for a treat by staying at this hotel.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.  The front desk is understaffed so be prepared to wait for a while when you check-in or call for any reason.  The descriptions on the website tell you you can relax by the hotel pool, but really you can't as it is a full on restaurant with hostess stand.  You can't go sit by the pool past 3pm and relax.  And you can't get a table even if you are a hotel guest unless you have a reservation.  I find the description very deceiving.  Even during the day there are only 6 lounge chairs by the pool.  The pool is more of a wading area as it is very small and shallow. Also, the &quot;comfortable&quot; beds were terrible.  We felt like we were sleeping on an air mattress as it made a horrible noise every time you moved which woke us up repeatedly.  Other than the bed, the room was fine though the shower never stops running despite telling you not to turn the handle past a certain place. This was so incredibly overpriced and disappointing.  It is the one regret of our otherwise fantastic vacation.",-1,0,0.633639456

We were given a room upgrade which was nice but the sofa was stained and the bed linen smelled of mildew.  If I were to use one word to describe the attitude of the customer service staff, it would be &quot;condescending&quot;.  The service at the hotel restaurant was simply awful. Our room wasn't properly cleaned, we were charged for an item we didn't take from the mini bar (and treated haughtily when pointing it out) had an issue with the valet, etc.  If you get a deal on a discount site, perhaps this place is a value but at the price we paid it wasn't.

135934396,We stayed at this hotel the last week of July. It seems like  it could be a decent boutique hotel- but they do not want families at this hotel. The pool is really nothing more than a wading pool. It is located in the middle of the lounge/restaurant.  We were told twice by the front desk that the pool was open until 7. When we went up at 6- the lounge manager promptly ran over to say he had &quot;bad news&quot;- the pool was closing in 15 minutes. When I told him the front desk said it was open until 7- he said he would &quot;make an exception&quot;- but that it was a safety issue. Then- when my children (age 7 and 10) went in the pool- they promptly surrounded them with &quot;caution wet floor&quot; signs.We actually ate lunch at the pool earlier in the day- very poor service (though I can't blame that on the kids- because no one seemed to be getting very good service).Overall- I would give this place a skip.,-1,0,0.416111111

This hotel's system charged my card an unauthorized and additional amount of $967 on top of my room charges on &quot;accident&quot; and no one is sure why. Yes, they reversed the charge BUT how quickly the money shows back up in your account is up to fate and your bank, not them.

Until then, my account stays down that amount. The front desk staff (specifically Nick) did everything they could to make up for this but as you can imagine on vacation thousands of miles from home &amp; having your funds not accessible to the extent of over a thousand dollars is dangerous, scary and frankly illegal. The day before check in at this hotel I was also charged a $319 amount &quot;on accident&quot; at a separate Kimpton Hotel (Kimpton Everly) which can further help paint the picture as to why this company as a whole is not something I'd ever recommend to travelers. To those already booked or who have stayed here before, I suggest you double check your bank activity for any suspicious charges from this hotel or any charges from IHG which is their company.

299393559,"Selected from my email to leadership.  Carpet bomb profanity through out this thing and you get my first draft.  This is going everywhere.On June 26, 2015, my fiancÃ©, her mother, and I were traveling together to celebrate Sharonâs birthday.  We had made a reservation for a suite at the Hotel Wilshire in Los Angeles that could accommodate the three of us.  We have stayed there before and rather enjoyed the experience.  When we went to check in that evening, the woman at the front desk at first could not locate our reservation.  She asked if someone from our party had already checked in, to which we said no.  We were already worried at this point.  After several minutes the front desk staff person told us that someone else had checked into the room, and called a member of the security team to check out a room and see if it was occupied.  She then sent us up to the room before hearing back from the security staff she sent ahead.  We passed this man on the way to the room and he said nothing to us, which as I will explain, was a serious problem.  When we entered the room we quickly realized that it was already occupied.  The television was on, and there were personal items like electronics, luggage, cigarettes laying around, as were the Raid the Minibar tickets with my fiancÃ©âs name on them.  The room smelled of smoke.  As you can imagine this was quite uncomfortable for her physically as well.  More seriously, this was a major safety/security breach for both us, and the other guest.It managed to get worse.  Of course we went back down to the front desk at this point.  We were all furious obviously, and we demanded resolution, but were informed that there were not any rooms left in the hotel that could accommodate the three of us.  Nor were there any at the sister property, The Palomar, which were not interested in anyway.  The security person tried to intervene by taking a command tone, and telling Amy that he âneeded her to calm down.â  This is precisely the wrong thing to say to someone your hotel had just failed so badly.  It was an incredibly rude, tone deaf, and clumsy attempt at intimidating us into not making a scene (which we were not doing anyway).  I could wear out a thesaurus listing words that could describe our anger, but Iâll go with livid.  Amy was not having it, and told this man that he needed to stop talking immediately.  Personally I was so angry that it made me high.  That isnât an exaggeration.  I was lightheaded and had a tingling numbness in my face and hands from the adrenaline dumping into my bloodstream.  At this same time the person we eventually realize had taken our room came behind us because he was now locked out and needed to have his key card recoded.  We later realized that this man simply asked for an upgrade at some point that day and was given our room. Letâs recap: our reservation was given away, which is unacceptable.  No notice was provide to us in advance of our arrival, which is unacceptable.  When confronted with this, your staff tried to shuffle us into an already occupied room, which is unacceptable.  Security saw us headed to the room where another personâs belongings were located (and someone with less integrity than our party had could have easily stolen), and failed to stop or warn us against going into the room we had just watched him exit, which is unacceptable. That security person was then rude to us when we went to express our dismay (as anyone would), which is as oblivious to common sense as it is unacceptable.  If this happened at a Motel 6, I would be torching it in reviews all over the internet.  And believe â¦ that WILL happen here. An offer was made to put us up in a nearby hotel that was not comparable.  We finally negotiated to be put in the Shore Hotel in Santa Monica at the Wilshireâs expense.  It managed to get worse. While The Shore was able to get us into their hotel eventually, this was an adventure too.  There was no single room that could accommodate us, and unlike what we were told at The Hotel Wilshire, there were not two rooms adjacent or close by.  This leads me to conclude that your staff failed to adequately coordinate with The Shore.  They simply panicked and told us whatever they could think of to get us to leave.  After a series of attempts by The Shore staff, we accepted two rooms on the opposite sides of their hotel.  I handled the booking to give Amy and her mother a break, since they were completely exhausted at this point.  We didnât make it into our rooms until well after 10 PM.  The true extant of how badly this would all go would become apparent several days later when I realized I had been charged for the rooms, and additional fees rather than the rooms being covered by The Wilshire.  This took over a week to fix because charges were removed, recharged, removed again, ad nauseum.Bear with me through this tangent, but in the movie Jackie Brown, right before Samuel Jackson shoots Robert DeNiro he says something to the effect of âwhat the hell happened to you, man?  You used to be beautiful.â  That right there is how we feel about Kimpton now.  Honestly, what went wrong?  You were doing so well.  So much so we have kept going back to Kimpton hotels in spite of prior problems we have had.  We did this because we always had confidence that Kimpton was capable of great things, and that even if things were to go wrong, the company would make things right.  We held back a few times from voicing our concerns because we donât want to be perceived as malcontents that complain to get free stuff.  Whether it is giving our reservation away, or forcing Amy and her mother to go through an acrophobic obstacle course in La Jolla, the cinderblock hard beds at the Argonaut in San Francisco, each time it seems like a test of our mental endurance.  Itâs too big of a fumble this time.  After this most recent incident we are just exhausted.  My fiancÃ© was near tears and asked me âare they just trying to get rid of us?â  I am familiar with the concept of firing customers if they are troublesome, and costing a company time and money.  There are far simpler, less expensive ways of doing that than handing off those customers room to some random person, and then having to put them up in another hotel.In the past you, or another representative of Kimpton would offer us a free stay, and/or some other benefit in a recovery attempt.  When that has come up, we were always very appreciative of the gesture.  It showed that Kimpton was trying to be good.  This time I honestly canât think of what it would take.  We are tired of saying âyouâre better than this.â  Now my fiancÃ© and I are saying to each other &quot;maybe they just arenât.&quot;  This is not about money.  What we want this time is actually going to be far more expensive; far more difficult for you to achieve.  What we most want is for you to get it together.  Stop making these egregious errors.  Stop employing these rude, incompetent staff members.  I highly recommend terminating some of these people outright.  At the very least they need some extensive retraining.  It should be embarrassing.  It should match the embarrassment that they should have felt at the time, and didnât.  It should exceed the embarrassment we felt, which was considerable.",-1,4,0.483340965

204516343,"It is important to stay somewhere safe in LA in terms of accommodation and that was the reason I have chosen this hotel - and indeed it was situated in the nicer part of the city, and despite no private parking available, it's quite easy to find a parking space next to the hotel anyway even if we arrived late on a Saturday night. I was happy about my choice of hotel at that moment, especially the moment I stepped in I saw the certificate of excellence by TA for consecutive 3 years (which to me is equivalent of a guarantee of quality).Only until I found bugs in my bed. I was staying in a ground floor room which is just opposite the kitchen (and I'm not sure if this increases the possibility of finding bugs in my bed). At first I didn't even notice, but when I finally saw bugs crawling on my pillows I was freaked out. Poor dad woke up from his sleep, found that he was bitten by bugs in his bed as well, looked like a rash on his back.So we complained to the receptionist, he gave us another room to stay - but when I finally moved our stuff and settled, it was like 2.00 in the morning and we had a long drive to LV the next day.Wasn't a very happy ending story in LA.The next morning I was trying to argue with someone, but unfortunately the owner wasn't present and the new receptionist said she had no say in my complaint apart from logging it on their book to the owner. Both she and the receptionist the night before claimed that there had been nothing like this before and they were shocked by it (and they even questioned if it were me bringing in these bugs into the hotel - interesting - if so why would those bugs be in pillows/on beds yet not anywhere nearer my suitcases...).Very disappointed - definitively worst stay in my Pacific costal trip this Easter.",-1,0,0.565539322

When I threatened to cancel because my pregnant wife can't be near smoking and a nasty dumpster a man came from behind the office and gave us a new room which miraculously became available. The new room was better, but had really old and rickety furnishings, a horrible musty odor, and uncomfortable bed, and a door that looked like forced entry was attempted on several occasions.

132921204,"We booked to stay at the Wilshire Crest in April 2012 for 6 nights.We needed somewhere that was a moderate price and in a decent location with good parking facilities for our hire car.We chose the Wilshire Crest Hotel because we thought it was all those things (apart from the parking), we didn't exactly think we'd be staying at the Ritz but we expected a bit of a higher standard of hotel for the money we paid than we ultimate got at the Wilshere Crest Hotel.On first appearances the hotel looks decent enough, tucked away into a residential suburb near the Wilshire Boulevard and The Grove Shopping Centre. But as soon as we got there I knew even my modest hopes of getting a semi-decent hotel for our stay in LA was dashed.The hotel itself looks very nice from the outside but once you get in the whole hotel feels a bit rundown. The stairs upto the First Floor are a bit rickety and old with a very badly sun-damaged carpet.The corridoor where the rooms are isn't that bad but is depressingly bland.Then the rooms themselves, where do I start?The walls are pretty thin, so you could hear things that maybe you didn't want to hear going on in the adjacent rooms. They're poorly lit and look like a depressing Motel room out of a movie, the sheets were adorned with numerous stains and cigarette burns which complimented the numerous stains on the walls and curtains.When we first went into the room there was hair in the Sink, and the toilet roll holder/soap holder in the bath/shower unit was rusty. This once again complimented the creaky taps and the small toilet in the tiny bathroom that the hotel supplied.Then we get to the breakfast. It was a travesty, It is a buffet where you're left to yourself to take as many Bagels/pastries as you want. It basically consisted of Bagels, cereal, tea/coffee, milk, some danish pastries and cake. Then there was this salad stuff that I saw no-one eat on my stay to compliment to 'delicious' bagels and pastries.I'm not 100% but pretty sure that they didn't put out fresh pastries/cakes every day and that the salad stuff was left out overnight. On more than 1 occasion I bit into a pastry and it was rock solid. and that's pretty much it, if you don't like Bagels or get fed up with having them everyday then it is terrible.As for drinks you get orange juice, milk, tea or coffee and that's about it, all served in polystyrene cups.The two plus points of the hotel were the parking permit you get which enables you to park anywhere in the adjacent roads aslong as you display the permit on your rear-view mirror. We had no problem parking the car and found the fact we didn't have to pay for parking, and the area to park the car is a very safe residential neighbourhood where you didn't have to worry about leaving your car overnight.And the other was the Television, you get a very extensive Time Warner Cable TV box that includes all the LA sports teams, films, news channels etc. you could ever want.So to summarise. We made a huge mistake by staying here, and I can confidently say that if we go to LA again we definitely won't be staying at the Wilshire Crest Hotel.Spend the Extra $$$ and stay at a much better hotel.",-1,1,0.528792735

We were scheduled to stay for 3 nights, but obviously didn't-  The next morning, I tried to check out, and was told that the rate for my 1 night stay had - suddenly- increased, it was now $375.00, which would be alright for a luxury hotel, but for a noisy, tiny concrete-floor room where the toilet was practically on top of the bathtub, it was, to use old-fashioned &quot;country&quot; expression, &quot;highway robbery&quot;   Save your money and stay in a nice hotel, where you will be treated with respect and be provided with a clean and comfortable room (we moved to the JW Marriott Hotel, where the room was 4 times the size, the fitness area was huge and apples/lavender-infused towels were served and free headphones, and a large brunch was included, all for less than what I paid at this awful place.  Oh, also, the JW Marriott is central to almost everywhere, so use an Uber and pay $30 to visit the Grove (and have a better stay than you would, staying at this motel).",-1,3,0.574115646

But recently in January, we experienced incompetent and unhelpful people, plus uncleanliness during our last stay.  On the phone, Saif promised us 3 times room 314 would be reserved for us. Saif even took our credit card and told us this would be a guarantee room 314 is ours and no one else will have it. After driving 7 hours and being in traffic, we finally arrived at the front desk, was told room 314 was given to someone else, Saif did not leave any notes about reserving room 314 for us, and Saif was not going to be there for a couple of days. It was late and we had no choice, but to take the only room they had available. Upon our arrival, we were exhausted and it was dark so we could not see what was outside our window. The few days we stayed there, we were awaken with construction noise &amp; workers yelling (ex: jack hammers, chainsaws, etcâ¦). DO NOT TRUST SAIF. Now I understand why all the prior Farmerâs Daughter front desk staff are no longer there, Wondering if Saif had something to do with this. Also, we had to call the front desk 3 times (15mins resulted in 2hours wait for the maid to show up) to get extra toiletries and a cracked glass replaced. Moreover, we found out the supply room was just 2 doors from our room hence we (and the front desk staff) did not understand why it took the maid so long. Additionally, in the sink, around the toilet seat, and floating in the toilet bowl were blonde hair as if someone was trimming their hair. (we both have curly brunette hair).",-1,1,0.351851852

With that said, location is great, but that's the only thing that it has going for it.  First, we arrive a half an hour before check in, and were told there werent any rooms available until later that day. The person at the front desk was COMPLETELY rude. We had to change our clothes in a bathroom next to the pool, which was awful, and leave our bags with the front desk. We arrived back to the hotel at 10pm only to have to wait for the guy at the front to figure out how to work the system. We were given our key, and it didnt work, I went back down and had to wait even longer for him to get it right.  There was no apology(by now it was almost 11pm).  There was some sort of construction going on, and it was VERY loud until midnight.  In the morning when I checked out, I asked the front desk(after waiting in line for a very long time, if there was a comment card I could fill out.

49128155,"As observed by other reviewers, this facility appears to be a motel converted to a hotel by closing public access to what used to be a parking lot and is now used for valet parking.  My friends and I occupied two rooms on the first floor, both of which face the parking lot.  One of our party was flying in from another state, and I picked her up at LAX and returned to the hotel at approximately midnight.  When we arrived there were a group of what I presume were hotel guests in the parking lot, apparently enjoying one another's company.  Their enjoyment (along with yelling and loud laughter) escalated until I finally called the front desk at 1:15 AM to ask them to call a halt to the party.  Though I believe their response was prompt since the noise stopped within a minute of my call, it frankly should not have been necessary for me to call in the first place.  The desk clerk could undoubtedly hear the noise, both because of the volume and the proximity of the party to the registration desk.  I can only conclude that no action was taken before because it never occurred to management that guests might want to sleep during pre-dawn hours.  I chose this facility only because of the location.  I expected little and was still disappointed.  Almost any motel or hotel should be able to deliver a place to get a decent night's rest.  That didn't occur the night I stayed.",-1,1,0.597058824

I called from LAX at 10am and asked if they could have my room ready within a few hours.  They stated that they would attempt to have it ready by the time I arrived.  I arrived at the hotel at noon yet nothing had been done to get the room ready.  I asked again and told them I would wait for a few more hours.  At this time there were 3 people asking for their rooms to be ready a little early.  It took 4 more hours before the rooms were ready.  There were ONLY 3 people asking to check into their rooms early.  Housekeeping could have cleaned these rooms first.  Yet somehow it took 4 to 5 hours AFTER the check out time to have the rooms cleaned.To add insult to injury with the hotel staff - particularly the housekeeping - I had left my MAC charger plugged into the MOTEL room outlet.  I realized this within an hour of leaving the Farmer's Daughter Motel.  I called and asked the front desk to retrieve the charger and give it to my mother who was staying at the MOTEL a few more days.  After multiple attempts to retrieve the charger AND my Mother asking them repeatedly at the front desk I STILL did not get my charger back.  They claimed they didn't find it.  Although I specifically told them exactly which plug it was in and have NO DOUBT that it was there.The TART restaurant at first blush seemed good - the breakfast was tasty.  However, again, the staff was not up to par.  We had a large group of ladies that went to breakfast (about 15) - we were the only ones in the restaurant.  Yet the staff still could not seem to get drinks or food out for our group.

The first was that the air conditioning was so noisy (and basic) that it woke us up every time it turned itself on (which was frequently).  The second was that there was something in the room, which may have been mildew or some residue from cleaning products or the air conditioning system which caused a strong allergic reaction in my wife.  The third was that when we complained the following morning, the hotel was totally unhelpful and devious and our attempts to speak to the management were frustrated at every turn.  All we got was a message saying that there was no problem with our checking out and that we would get a refund for the nights we had not used followed by a later message saying that we would not get a refund but that we should arrange a charge back through the credit card company.  When we tried to arrange this, the hotel responded by lying, saying among other things that we had not made the problem known to the front desk and that, had we done so they would have sorted everything out to our satisfaction, and then relying on the fact that we had made the reservation over the internet on a non-refundable basis and making it clear that they were going to keep our money.BEWARE THIS HOTEL!

I looked at the company's website and was excited about trying a new local hotel and restaurant.  I made a point to look at the details so I would know what the limitations were for the deal.  I was very interested in the No Tell Room and I decided that I would take the plunge and purchase the deal.I reserved the room only to hear back from the reservations clerk on my voicemail stating that the deal does not apply to suites.  I clearly read the restrictions prior to my purchase and reservations.  I was careful in reading the property's website that was advertised to make sure that I was booking within the guidelines of the offered deal.The deal is clear about what it offered.  It clearly stated that I am required to pay a green fee, the blackout dates, and the fact that the voucher cannot be used for SUITES.  The property's website in NO WAY indicates that the No Tell Room is anything but a ROOM.  The hotel offers single rooms, double rooms, no tell room, and farmers suites.  Anyone that reads the hotel website could righteously say that the farmer's suite is not part of the deal, but the other ROOMS are within the parameters of the deal offered.  The description of the No Tell Room on the hotel website in no way indicates that it is a suite, but only references it as a ROOM.  It does not indicated that it has more than one room, possibly indicating a suite.  There is no reference anywhere on the hotel website that this ROOM is a suite.  The deal does not restrict any of the rooms, it only says that the customer cannot use it for a suite.I contacted the Farmer's Daughter Hotel and received the worst service.  The operator answered and I requested the reservation department.  She stated that she could help me.  I informed her of my voicemail and she abruptly stated that the deal was no good for suites.  I tried to tell her about the verbiage on the deal website and their own website and she cut me off stating that it is not good on a suite.  Frustrated, I asked for the General Manager of the property.  I was transferred to Dan (unknown last name), who stated that he was the GM of the Farmer's Daughter.  He was abrupt and constantly interrupted as I told him my plight.  He repeatedly stated that it didn't matter what the website stated, that their in-house computer systems indicate the the No Tell Room is a suite.  When I tried to tell him that his website does not indicate this, he stated that he was still not going to honor the deal for that room.  When I shared my frustrations with Farmer's Daughter not standing by their advertised work, Dan told me that he was still not going to honor what was advertised.

After another noisy night we decided that we would stay put as it was either a choice between the machines or the music blaring day and night from the restaurant. During that day there was a staff member outside our room sanding down tables possibly from the restaurant. That was fine but at 10.30pm that night he was a still noisy, sanding with lights blazing in to our room. What with the noise of the machines, music from the restaurant and now the constant scraping of the sandpaper right outside our room, this was the final straw. We asked the girl at the front desk if she could stop the man from sanding the tables at such a late hour and she was blissfully unaware that he was still working out there and showed no consideration for  the guests. He did eventually pack up and leave. We decided to not let this horrendous MOTEL ruin our holiday so phoned around to find something else. The next morning we told the man at the desk that we were leaving. He could not have cared less and did not even inquire as to why. He then told my husband that he would be charging us for the whole seven nights as it had been booked by Expedia. This was absolute rubbish and when I challenged him about it he said that he had made a mistake with the room number. Rubbish, he was incompetent and seemed to enjoy informing us that we had to pay for the 7 nights out of spite, he then was not in any way genuinely apologetic for his error. They did charge our credit card for the whole seven nights but did refund the difference after a few days. We left and went to a different hotel who couldn't have been more welcoming and helpful in a similar location with a much cheaper price.

We arrived mid morning after a tedious flight from China. Our rooms were not ready and under no circustances would the staff help us out. I have been the world over and never were staff as rude and unhelpful as this. The woman at the desk was robotic in repeating when check in time was. There were empty rooms but no go. The manager was mean and uncooperative. P.S. Heating vents were open and television was broken. The pits!",-1,1,0.465705128
168985960,"Don't be fooled by their photos.  I booked a trip here after seeing good Trip Advisor ratings but was very disappointed.  This is an old MOTEL that they fixed up with a very minimal budget.  The bed and pillows  and chairs look like they came from a flea market there is no central air.  So there is a large, very loud air conditioner in the room.I was traveling for business and this is definitely not a good hotel for that.  Internet service was pretty spotty and extremely slow.  And service was horrible but most likely because the staff seem all be in their 20s and are not trained.  No one helps with bags, asks if you need anything at check in.  They are extremely rude and no one seems to go out of their way or even apologize for inconvenience. This seems to be true at the hotel and restaurant.Rooms do not have blackout shades, just cheap curtains. Very thin walls so you hear everything.  I had to turn on a white noise app on my phone at full blast to sleepOne star for location, you can walk to the Grove across the street.  But this is a motel so it should be priced that way.  If it was $120, I would complain but I have stayed at a W hotel for this price!!!!",-1,4,0.621678571

5889654,"Apparently, an outside service takes reservations for this hotel and due to some sort of miscommunication the service mistakenly took our reservation with a pet. The hotel refused to honor the it or to arrange for us to go to a different hotel. What was more irritating is that they made sure we didnât have any written proof they reservation included a pet (we made it via phone) and later with a very straight face commented it had happened several times before because the outside serviceâs mistake. Our observation that the reservation service and the hotel are the same thing for customers like us (we called the number in their web site) didnât seem to register with the manager. Bottom line, we were stuck in L.A. late afternoon with a large dog and nowhere to go.

502246193,"The Farmer's Daughter is clean and in great location but that is where it ends.  The hotel seems like it was designed by a 1st year design student who got 4th place due to its impracticability in the real world.  The rooms are small, to balance that there is a glass wall between the bedroom and bathroom, if you like going to the bathroom in an aquarium this room is for you.  You could close the curtain which then defeats the purpose of the glass wall.  They also added a huge mirror, which not only takes up valuable space, anyone sitting on the beds can see you in the bathroom.  The beds are small have extremely sharp edges.  I defy anyone to spend anytime without getting serious shin bruises.  The seating area with table and a stool all of which again takes up valuable space ends up being used for all your belongings.  Nowhere to put suitcases  The bedside table is a miniature shelf, with the lamp clock and phone nowhere to put your stuff forcing you to leave it on the cement floor.  If you are a lone traveler or someone who travels with little stuff, or have lived and worked on a submarine you'll do ok in this room, but a family will not survive such cramped quarters.  If you feel claustrophobic there is a seating area outside but in the evening you'd get better light from the moon.  And on one side of the building is a construction site that works 7am - 3pm Mon ~Sat  They don't mention that until you discover it for yourself.  They do have a happy hour ~ Whiskey, who drinks whiskey plus the cups are small and the decanter is 1/3 full.

As I checked in, I was told that I would not be welcomed back with him and that the person that made my reservation would be fired. (Apparently they have a 30 pound limit and the reservationist forgot to tell me this.) The owner/manager made me immediately feel uncomfortable (told me &quot;someone would be fired for this&quot;) and sorry for any poor soul who had the misfortune to work for him. The lobby was nice and the new restaurant is wonderful. But the rooms screamed: crusty MOTEL! The mattresses were squeaky and thin. There was chewed gum and hair in my flower pot. Then to top it off my bathtub backed up with the waste water from the room above me every morning when someone took a shower up there. (Check out my photo above.)

When we arrived, we were told they did not have a room with 2 beds and could only offer us a king and a roll away. The gentleman at the desk was friendly and felt bad, but didn't have any other option for us. He said they would have the proper room the next day. There are 4 people in my family and 3 of us had to share the king bed. The next day when we inquired about the room change, we were told that we would have to check out of the room we were in at 11am, bring our luggage downstairs and wait until another room was available between 11:30 and 1. There was no offer by the staff to move our luggage for us and the fact that we would actually be without access to a room or our luggage for hours was not acceptable. I left 2 messages with the GM for a call. Though our folio indicated that he left a msg on my cell phone he did not. They offered us a $25 discount for our troubles, but it has yet to appear on our credit card.I received a request from the hotel for feedback and shared all this in an email, which I also copied the GM on.

We were supposed to have a mountain view, but we had a parking lot view next to the lobby. The restaurants were expensive and the food was awful. The breakfast buffet was the worst that I have ever had. It was worse than a 2 star in Mexico!

It was like the food had been cooked a day before &amp; it was very expensive. The tables were so dirty that if we put anything on them, they would get stuck to the surface. I counted 10 tables that had not been bussed the entire time we were at the restaurant. Save your money and drive to Canmore, it is so much better there!

303897731,"Front desk clerk was very helpful, we did make the decision to upgrade to a king at the Signature Club; as we found out we did not have A/C nor was breakfast included with the room we had originally booked.  The upgrade also included appetizers in the afternoon in the Club Lounge.  Breakfast wasn't anything close to offering what we expected, everything was cold - nothing hot was offered, best you could get was a bagel.  The two best restaurants (we have been told) were both closed during the time of our stay, we ended up going to their Fireweed Grill - no great reviews from us, it's one step away from a cafeteria if you ask us.  We did the appetizers the first evening we arrived - not much offered - did not know bar service was available until we found waiters hiding in a cubby, they said yes we sell it but oddly enough never asked, could never find the concierge; tried a couple of times.  There was underground parking - that was a surprise.

Yeah, got some for my husband then the carafe ran out but gee again how lucky the server said he happened to have another carafe in the back, poured from that, yep full of grounds - guess they didn't dump the pot out from earlier.  Dumped it and went to Starbucks.

337407855,"Well, we checked in and we're looking forward to a relaxing time. When booking we had asked for a quiet room away from elevators and ice machines. We were in Signature Club and our rooms were directly by the ice machine. All night we were kept up and to top it all off a dog barked all night. We complained in the morning to Jenna who informed us that no dogs were allowed on that floor. We complained enough that they moved us to the end of the hotel far away from ice machines and elevators what we had asked for in the first place. I think they should have dog rooms on one level of the hotel only. Big dogs run through the hotel and are present during the Signature Clubs continental breakfast and the afternoon appetizers. Not a good thing!! We had booked a reservation at the Seasons Steakhouse and were not informed on booking that a set menu was only available. Most of the 5 course meal was seafood which we don't like and for $120.00 it was outrageously priced for food we don't like. We left to try and find a place to eat. Tried the bar which the menu was lamb, bison, boar, elk etc. Whatever happened to good old fashioned chicken wings or nachos in a bar??? Left there and eventually got into the Grappa Italian Restaurant which was just average food. Coming back to the room dogs were barking and we called front desk as we were told no dogs on that floor allowed. We were informed that they were busy and allowed dogs on every floor. Front desk told me that the dog was not their dog and they couldn't do anything but they would try to contact the dog owner. What a gong show!!! Signature Club breakfasts and appetizers were horrible. Dried old veggies, seaweed slaw Gross!!! All deep fried seafood. What are they thinking? Nothing fresh. Coffee even cold.

544799226,"We are on our last day of our annual Dec family weekend here in kananaskis. We have been coming here for years and found this trip to be very expensive and hugely disappointing. Construction noise right outside our window began at 8 am on Sat and 7:30 am on Sun. Don't come expecting to sleep in or have a nap during the day. We fully understand that during construction noise is to be expected but DON'T CHARGE FULL PRICE for rooms if that is the case. We also arrived to find out the hot tub was closed even though our confirmation email said it should be open by the beginning of Dec. Upon check in there was no mention that the only restaurant that would be open on Saturday night for us and our kids was the lounge.When we asked why forte was closed we were told it was because most people were attending a banquet. We weren't...so just the one restaurant option for us. We would have really appreciated knowing this was going to be the case when we booked as we planned to go to forte for a celebration dinner for our son on Sat night. Or if they had at least told us upon check in we would have gone on Fiday night. Ordering room service was an interesting experience. When we asked how big the pizzas were we were told &quot;normal&quot; size. When asked what that meant, she was unable to tell us how many inches it was. So we tried again by saying was it an individual pizza or could two people share? She said it was individual sized so we told her we would order two for two people. ( at $20 a pizza) The pizza came and it was huge so one pizza was completely wasted as was the cost of it. When asked what came with the $30+ steak we were told, &quot;um probably a salad and maybe some potatoes&quot;.  We tried to clarify but she kept saying maybe this and maybe that.  It was bizarre. When the steak arrived it did not have what she said but the steak itself was delicious. We did have to wait well over an hour every time we ordered anything from room service with a mandatory $15 % gratuity already added to the bill. Just a note about the lounge as well, we were very disappointed with the serving size of the app is we ordered. Three of the smallest crab cakes we have ever seen (We order crab cakes whenever a restaurant offers them) cost us $19...yikes! The only reason we are giving two stars instead of one is we did encounter a few attempts to provide good service. Our son was bitterly disappointed when he learned the Marriott no longer provides free hot chocolate in the lobby. When we asked Liam in the lobby about this he said he was sorry to disappoint and surprised us with free hot chocolate and cookies in our room. This was awesome and greatly appreciated. When I complained about the construction noise literally 10 feet outside my window so early in the morning, I was given a discount on the room with many apologies. This was appreciated, but my view is I should not have been paying full price ($350 a night) and then placed in this room in the first place. It pains me to write this review as this has been a favorite destination for us to so long but all these issues, the fact that everything is so expensive now and the new contempory feel of a once homey hotel has been a disappointment.",-1,3,0.516831918
502529891,"We stayed three nights on a Newmarket Holidays tour from Vancouver to Calgary. This complex of 3 hotels is operated by Marriott and is undergoing refurbishment.  It would seem that this program very significantly affects the standard of accommodation on offer (compare our room photos with the official pictures) and the Delta Lodge was undoubtedly the worst hotel of our 2 week tour.  I have stayed in many Marriott hotels around the world over the years and this one was by far the worst.  I don't like giving a poor review but I always stick to the facts without embellishment.Prior to arrival, we knew that rooms would not be available before 16:00 so our tour director ensured that we would not arrive early.  En route, he called forward to check that all was ok.  We arrived around 16:20 to be advised that a number of rooms were still not ready for occupation.  Our room was one of those but, as the tour director's was ready, he gave us his room.  It was some long time before all people had access to their rooms.The room was large with a double bed, lounge area and door to a patio.  There was no aircon and the fan which was supposed to be 'in the closet' had to be requested. The bathroom was tired, had a shower and curtain over the bath and needed renovating.  The patio area was dirty and had many cigarette butts stamped out on it (see picture).We eat at the pub Woody's on two nights and had excellent service, food and advice on the beers. The Dead Man beer is excellent!  Woody's and their servers were the best part of our stay.On our first morning, we chose to have breakfast in the main Forte dining room and select from the a la carte options as $50 for 2 for a buffet breakfast was over the top.  After sitting for 15 mins, we requested a server to take our order.  Toast for one and a bagel for one seemed an easy selection.  A server delivered 2 slices of bread and one buttered bagel on the same plate.  We requested toast which the sever believed he had delivered and bagel on a second plate. Eventually the toast was delivered but with no butter or preserves.  The bagel was so cold the butter never melted.With more days at the hotel, I spoke with a customer relations manager concerning the very bad service in the restaurant and the dirty patio.  He made all the right noises but I felt that with so many 'suits' wandering around the site just chatting, not much would change.  I was correct.  We were given a voucher for breakfast to compensate for the failings with a promise to try the restaurant again to see the improvement.  We chose the last day to experience the restaurant breakfast to allow time for change to be implemented.  There was no change.  We checked out 40 hours after meeting the customer relations manager and the patio area had still not been cleaned.As an expensive taxi is required to access any other restaurants and bars, customers at Kananaskis are captive and this may be one of the causes of the poor service and high prices.I would not return before the renovation is completed and before the management improve the services.",-1,3,0.53899093

Nope. They just want to sell you their own firewater, and appear to employ a strapping young man to enforce this moronic policy to boot. The restaurants are overpriced and open irregularly. Need underground parking to keep the bird poop off your car? Extra charge. Parking isn't convenient to the front door.

The receptionist at the front told me there were SPACE HEATERS in the closet to warm up the room which really did nothing! Shocking giving the price point we paid to stay here. Also I've never stayed at a 4 star hotel that doesn't provide complementary water bottles in the room?? Don't come here during the week because all the restaurants are closed except the middle pub area that provide generic food. The shopping area was under construction too so it was not open. besides the Nordic Spa and the kids pool this hotel needs a lot of work.

310305670,"This had to be the WORST experience and service I have EVER received from a hotel. Honestly, at the type of hotel they display themselves to be and the prices they charge, you would expect the service and experience to be wonderful. That was definitely NOT the case. I have never been more upset with a hotel for their lack of courtesy and lack of concern. I had booked a special stay for my parentsâ anniversary and I wanted to not only pay for their stay but for all other charges as well (as there are many hidden fees that a guest may not be aware of). The first time I called, the person at the front desk was not helpful at all in explaining how I was go about paying for everything. So, since I really wanted to make this stay special for my parents, I looked online and noted that there was a form that had to be filled out and sent in. So I called a second time, and they told me that that was the form I would have to use (secure billing form) to indicate and make notes as to what I wanted to be charged for and cover for my parents. I explained that I wanted to include breakfast in the stay, parking and any dining charges and they indicated that I was to write that down in the note column of the secure billing form. So I went to the website and filled out the form and then CLEARLY wrote EXACTLY what I wanted them to do to let my parents know what would be included. I indicated that I wanted the front desk (at time of check-in) to let my parents know that breakfast would be included in their stay and that they would not be charged (as I would be paying for that-just said for them to write their room number down). I also indicated the same for parking, and for any dining charges. I even looked at all the restaurants at the hotel and at all the menus to see which restaurants I know my parents would prefer. I then indicated in the note to just inform my parents that dining at that specific restaurant would be a good choice. And finally, I just asked that the person at the front desk would be able to greet them and wish them a happy anniversary. Even after I received my confirmation email that the secure billing form was sent and received, I called the hotel again to ensure that it was received and that all the notes were there. I was told very carelessly that 'yes, we got your letter' and the call was ended. I guess I should have suspected that at the quality of the service I was receiving over the phone, the quality wouldnât be any better for my parents. Anyways, it would be an understatement to say that this was the worst experience. Nobody told my parents ANYTHING out of any of the notes that I had indicated so they ended up not only paying for their own breakfast, but also for all their dining. I cannot express how upset I am. I called several times to make sure that this would be an unforgettable experience for my parents who work so hard and donât take vacations. It was definitely unforgettable, but in the wrong way.To top it off, I called to ask for a copy of my bill that I never received and I explained what had happened and I was told that they were so sorry and that a manager would soon call and talk to me about it. However, nobody called me for 3 DAYS, so I had to be the one to call back, and then call back again. Honestly I have received better service at a motel than at the Delta Lodge. It is just an overpriced hotel with poor service and even poor follow-up. Never going to stay again, and will also let my family and friends know!",-1,1,0.596963071
309649588,We were quite disappointed with this Delta. This is a very dated hotel in need of a major face lift. The room was unbearably hot due to the lack of air conditioning or even a minimum of air circulation. We had to sleep with the room door open just to get a bit of the ice cold air that was blowing in the hallway into our room so we could breathe. We would not stay there again.,-1,0,0.610714286

We made reservations for a premium king room for 2 nights and a spa treatment as well.Maybe I was expecting too much that since it was valentines day house keeping would place a wrapped piece of chocolate on the bed. Nothing there. Not even a flower person to buy some roses from... it was a very business (cold) feel to the whole hotel.Room: Well... the room was horrible....squeaky floors, noisy bathroom fan (connected with the light, so no option to not have the fan), dated furnishings, and noisy neighbors.... (but they weren't actually being noisy. It felt and sounded like the whole building was going to fall apart).Restaurants: Way over priced for what you get. I understand the food has to be transported to this hotel, but a $44 buffet dinner and $22 breakfast to me is just gouging... (oh, and those prices are per person before tax and gratuity).Spa: great. At least that was worth it...",-1,3,0.486363636
225987201,"We were there for a wedding. Aug 28 Thurs- arrived after 1 pm. Unwelcoming, snotty female clerk told us rooms won't be ready until 4pm. Told her we were tired. Given rooms 45 mins later  in the main building. Rm 2069 - very hot. Called front desk and asked for someone to fix thermostat. Supercilious male answered and said building has no AC (as if I should have known that)  and to use fan in closet.  Rm 2071 - fan only pointed to the floor. TV - hardly any channels worth watching.  Aug 29 - Rm 2053 - ordered a tray of sandwiches for family. Ate half. Took a walk for 1/2 hr. Came back -housekeeping took away half tray of sandwiches.  Called down to front desk. Told sandwiches left out in room a HEALTH HAZARD and that's why removed. WHAT?? . Funny that - they didn't empty waste bins. Wedding reception held in tent. Some servers slow and rude. One told guests this is his last job before school so couldn't be bothered. Washrooms in other building. Night, raining. Pathway gravelly and muddy. No lights to guide way. Here's tip: String some lights on the trees, make the pathway a little friendlier to walk in high heels. This type of accommodations - I've had better in  3rd world countries. Housekeeping and service - worst ever. Told check out clerk we had a bad experience. She said the rooms will be upgraded in 2017 by new owners. Another tip: Upgrade housekeeping and service well before that. Saving grace? Nice scenery",-1,5,0.422225589

We had to sleep with  the  window open  which  we were  awoken  at 5 am by snow plows. The hot  tub was by far the  most disgusting. The water was lukewarm  at best 2 days in a row. And was questionable  as to when  it was cleaned last. Food and service at Bighorn and Grappas was fantastic however Firewood  was terrible. We had dinner, lunch and brunch  all different servers  all terrible. We continuously  asked for the  same things over and over  before they were brought  to our table. Us as a couple alone  spent  well over 1000 dollars  in the  weekend  at the Delta in rooms and food and we overpaid. The village is a beautiful  setting however  the  rooms  in the Delta need some  major renovation. As we checked out  this morning  the  desk  was overcrowded and an attendant spoke  over  the  heads  of  other guests  and said &quot;we have your card on file and email address you  don't  need to  wait in line&quot;.

Secondly, there was not air conditioning in the room. The manager left a letter on the table suggesting to us to keep the lights off and the windows closed due to unseasonably warm temperatures.  Across the mountains there was a forest fire...the smoke blew in the direction of the hotel and into the room.  I had the windows open because in was HOT inside the room. I was offered a secondary fan for my room. A fan to circulate the warm air- that makes sense!! NOT!  In addition, there was a wall internet/phone jack exposed from wall. An accident waiting to happen. It took over an hour for someone from the staff to bring us up a second fan requested. This was NOT a Marriott quality hotel.

506921666,"The company for which I work hosted a meeting at the Delta Lodge at Kananaski in Calgary. With it being a Marriott property, I certain had high expectations.There were some high points: beautiful location; friendly staff; a banquet captain that made sure that I had some soup to take to my room to eat when I was unable to participate in a group dinner I had organized because I was so sick with some sort of respiratory condition.It was not until I checked in that I realized that the rooms in the actual lodge had NO air conditioning.I do understand that there was air conditioning in some of the rooms outside of the lodge. As a result, the room's windows had to be left open for ventilation even though the outside air was filled with smoke due to forest  fires in the area. Due to the heat and smoke, it was difficult to sleep at night. In addition to the smoke and heat, the hotel played music throughout the night and apparently pumped the music into the parking area in front of the hotel and it could be heard in my hotel room.The defining moment with my stay came when I had a nosebleed in my bed on Sunday night (July 16th). I thought housekeeping would change the bloodied sheets on Monday when they cleaned my room. This did not happen and the bloodied bed was made as if it were perfectly clean. So, on Monday evening, I filled out the housekeeping tag that was hung on my room door asking that the room be cleaned on Tuesday at a certain time and wrote a request to change the sheets. The bloodied bed was remade on Tuesday. I ended up moving to the other bed in the room rather than sleep in the soiled bed. There were two reasons that I wanted the sheets changed -- (1) I had bled on the sheets and (2) it was so hot that I had sweated a lot on the sheets during the hot nights and coughing. I could not help but think that the housekeeping staff might not even be changing sheets between guests if the sheets looked clean. My bloodied sheets weren't changed even though I had requested the change.It gives me no pleasure in reporting this unpleasant experience but feel other travelers need to be aware.",-1,1,0.55781746

We too were upgraded to a loft room which, though lovely to look at, as others have mentioned had a broken thermostat and only a space heater to compensate. Brrr. At -24Â° the heat was not sufficient and we both froze all night long. At least the beds were comfortable. The hotel pool was closed (good thing we weren't counting on using it) and the shower was less than optimal. The food at the restaurant was the only really great thing about our stay and Adam, who was our waiter for both dinner and breakfast, was very friendly. When the bill came by email, several days later, there were several levies and also a 'Destination Marketing Fee' that was not explained. BTW, this is total BS and people should refuse to pay it. Why are the customers, who are already paying an absolute FORTUNE to stay at a hotel expected to pay for destination marketing??!! Although it is not required to pay this fee in Alberta we were given a lame excuse and told we would have to go to another site to complain. We are talking $9 on a $530 bill here, for a room without heat. Please....Disappointed and will not be returning to stay.

Our room had no toilet paper and had someone else's long black hair all over the floor. To top it all off the morning after checking out we went to the fireweed grill for breakfast where the meals for half of our table were forgotten and the meals that did come out were cold.

We were told we could move to another building with A/C but that would be a $50 upgrade. The bathroom and furniture were also very old. Understand the hotel is going to be renovating but in the meantime it shouldn't be considered an 'upgrade' to be in what travelers expect to be a standard room today. Some services are also dated: it isn't easy to charge something to your room at the shops or to buy products at the Spa.

Its our anniversary and we don't get a lot of time without kids. After finding a sitter and booking online we couldnt wait.When arriving to the lodge, check in was smooth. We booked a loft room which was ready early. All was looking positive. We got into our room and noticed a chill, but a space heater was going. We assumed they were trying to make it extra comfortable for us. Wrong! The thermostat on the wall didnt work. We called down to frot desk when were informed that none of them work. We asked for more blankets and a few more logs for our fire. we got more blankets but mentioned we were taking the last of the extra blankets??? How many other people needed extra blankets. We though we would let the room warm up, so we went for a very expensive drink down at the bar. My husbands old fashion was $20.00! 90% of it was a huge cube of ice! We get back to the room and its still freezing. We had the fire going, space heater, two blankets and my heating pad on me and I was still freezing. I called down to front desk and she asked what more she could do to make it better. I asked for another space heater and she said there is no more available and even if there was, it would trip the breaker so that wouldn't work. After she could offer me nothing but her condolences we decided to leave the resort. We got charged $250,00 for 4 hours of freezing our buts off.

Despite the weather outside, the rooms were hot and we couldn't sleep.  You couldn't open the window because of the bars keeping them shut.  Hotel adds a whole bunch of extra fees onto your bill- be prepared to pay more than you expected and don't bother trying to have a meaningful conversation about it with the front desk who can't do anything, or the manager who won't even try to do anything about it.

Checking into the Hotel is a nightmare...there really aren't any signs directing a customer where the hell to go. The Hotel was under construction during our stay, but, we were not bothered by any noise. After checking in and receiving instructions as to park, we searched for the underground parking structure. We were certain we must have misunderstood what the clerk had told us. The direction took us thru a construction site...just as we were turning around we noticed another vehicle approach a plain white closed garage door...AGAIN NO SIGNAGE. The garage opened and the vehicle entered. We followed and the door opened and there was construction debris litter scattered on the ground. AGAIN NO SIGNAGE as where to enter. We unloaded our car and pet and had to carry our luggage trying to figure out which elevator to take...and there were zero employees to ask for directions. Once we found our room and opened the door...the temperature inside was at least 85 degrees Fahrenheit. I looked for the thermostat and didn't find one. I immediately called the front desk and was told that only the main part of the Hotel had air-conditioning. After complaining, the manager on duty moved us to the air-conditioned section. This room was also oppressingly hot, but had two wall air units. For three nights we had to leave the windows wide open because the units only made noise and produced zero cool air. This Hotel has one main circulating heat system throughout the entire Hotel. You have no choice as to what temperature is comfortable for you. Even with the windows open 24 hrs a day...it NEVER COOLS OFF.

In fact I ended up with two extra reservations that did not even show up in my email.  If I hadn't had to change a date I would have ended up having to pay for 2 rooms I didn't need.  Our room was quite nice but next to a guest with a barking dog.  When they left their room it barked continuously and even when they were in the room it would bark when it heard someone in the hall.  The only thing more annoying was the front desk then calling their room.  And then failing that, sending security up, who then knocked loudly on the door, calling &quot;Security!&quot; to finally take the dog away. That was a real commotion. When we complained, we were told we could possibly be moved.  But they had no answer as to &quot;why should we have to be inconvenienced?&quot;Then the next night, when the rest of my party arrived, there was no parking anywhere near where we were staying.  And underground was not even suggested as an option.  Instead we had to drive around trying to find someplace to park, until we finally gave up and went back to reception to arrange parking.  We were told that the parking did not belong to the hotel so they had no control over it.  Do you think as a guest I really care what arrangement the hotel has?  I just want to be able to park my car.  It's not like I'm going to take a cab or walk to Kananaskis.The one evening we tried to enjoy the hot tub, but like several other guests we were chased away from the outdoor pool when some other idiot guest decided he should light up a cigar.  The pool area is so understaffed that it was easier to just leave then find someone to complain to.Before checking out I did complain to the desk manager about the dog and I was told, &quot;everyone knows the hotel is dog friendly and understands that there may be some barking&quot;.  Really????  So if everyone knows, why didn't I?  I must have missed that on the great booking website they have.I'm a dog lover so the barking really wasn't that major an issue.

On arrival it was $43.  That's fine,  I expect good hotels to be very pricey but in return would expect something back.  We arrived at about 12:30 and were seated in a large conference room with about as much ambience as a basement.  I felt like I was waiting to hear a key note speaker after my meal.  The only windows in the room were on one side and they were quite small and didn't provide any reflection of the beauty that surrounded the facility.We were provided 1 cup of coffee upon sitting and were never offered another until well after eating.  Same with the juice, but I had to ask for that.  There was also no juice station or coffee station to help yourself so you are at the mercy of your server who we never saw untill it was almost time for the bill.  The Prime Rib that was offered was so red and bloodied that I truly wondered if it was still breathing.  After returning to my table there was this puddle of blood on top of my prime rib.  So disgusting I couldn't eat it.  The food overall was, I believe below average.  The offerings were fairly standard but I would not say the quality was anything better than at your average $19 buffet.  The fresh sliced Ham off the bone was excellent in all fairness but that was about all.The desert table should be an embarrassment to this hotel.  It was all picked over and all that was left were leftover scraps that who knows what had happened to them since they came to the table.  Presentation was so unappealing. Of the 4 staff we encountered, they were ok but nothing above and beyond.  Not sure what their fear is about serving coffee.  Usually the staff will remove your plate after you have eaten but despite them piling up around our table with each visit to the buffet they never removed any of our plates until after we had eaten and they were about to fall of the ends of the table due to overcrowding.  I have very humble expectations when it comes to restaurants but sadly this one couldn't even meet that, and at $43 a head, that is shameful.  It was definitely not worth the drive out from the city and based on this experience I would not return nor recommend it.

I pointed out that the website did not indicate there was no A/C, and she retorted, &quot;It didn't say that we do, either.&quot;  Playing cute at this point wasn't cute.Once she realized I had Gold Marriott status, she upgraded me to an airconditioned suite.

We were upgraded to a Loft Suite in the Mount Kidd Manor building and honestly, these rooms are nothing special.  Besides having a balcony, and a loft, I didn't really see what the big deal was.  The wallpaper was peeling in quite a few places, the table had numerous scratches on it and the bathroom had a stain on the floor.  The bathroom is extremely small; there is barely enough room for one person to get ready in, let alone two.  The first day it took over 5 minutes to get hot water in the shower.  After checking in, we were quite hungry and the only restaurant open was the Bighorn Lounge.  The food was great, but we felt extremely bad for the server when we first got there as he was the only one working (bartending as well), and it was quite busy.  The second morning we ordered room service for breakfast which was also nothing spectacular.  By the time the food got there it was mostly cold.  We walked around the grounds after breakfast which are extremely nice (the walking trails are plentiful, and the viewpoints have a lot to offer).  Now... the wedding began at 2:30 and was scheduled to be outside at viewpoint #5, but due to weather we were unsure if it would still be outside.  I had called the Front Desk and they had informed me it was still outside.  We had walked out to the viewpoint around 2:15, and nobody was there; it looked like the ceremony had already finished.  We walked back to the Mount Kidd Manor to re-check the sign and ran into an employee.  We asked him where the wedding was located and he had no idea, so he went to get a co-worker.  When the second employee came out, he as well had no idea what location the ceremony was taking place at.  The second location was the Gold Room and we asked where that was; he replied that he &quot;thought&quot; it was in the Main Lodge but wasn't sure.  We made our way to the lodge and just barely made it in time for the ceremony.  I was extremely disappointed with the service we received.  I would expect a lot more from a Delta; customer service was greatly overlooked.  We returned to our room after 3 pm, to find that our room service trays were still there.  The garbage hadn't been taken out; nothing had been cleaned besides the bed.  When we called down to the Front Desk, they did send a housekeeper up to clean the room; still very unacceptable in my eyes.  All in all, for the price paid per night, I was extremely disappointed with our stay.  This definately does not live up to the expectations you get when booking at a Delta property.  I would not recommend this property to anyone; go and stay in Banff, Calgary, Canmore, Jasper... you will not be disappointed there.  I will not be returning.",-1,2,0.477694721

I was actually quite excited when I first found out we were going to Kananaskis as I have never been in the area despite living in Calgary for over 30 years.The area is quite lovely with walking paths all around the hotel complex.  The rooms however, leave a lot to be desired.  The hotel is undergoing refurbishment but the rooms we were put in were so dated and there was no air conditioning.  I absolutely would not want to stay here during the summer heat as I think the rooms would be unbearable.  There was a large oscillating fan in the front closet of the room that I pulled out and plugged in but the oscillating function was broken on that too.  The strangest thing was that the hallway was absolutely freezing, probably to try to compensate for the uncontrollable heat in the room.

139958634,"I dislike Trip Advisor reviews that seem so one sided negative - and typically come with a single &quot;star&quot;. I dislike &quot;one star&quot; ratings when the reviewer seems to go on a irrational one sided rant: so let me get to the positives: some of the staff were polite and very professional and very pleasant. The location - especially on a sunny afternoon driving up through the magnificent mountains was remarkable. As we pulled up to be checked in - we had a very pleasant experience as a Manager greeted us and walked us to the front desk and arranged our valet parking and engaged us in friendly chit chat.From that point it was downhill - the reception asked if our children and dogs would be joining us soon (which we found curious as we have neither). After a brief discussion we were told that we had the same name as another reservation (which was just about as curious as we have a very uncommon last name). We had reserved at the club level - so off we went to the building (of 3) that is designated for this type of room / amenity level. As it was just after 6 PM we went straight to the lounge to have a snack. Despite the lounge being open for appys from 5 to 7 - all the food was gone. When we inquired of the attendant we were told it had been a very busy hour and that because &quot;there were lots of kids - food all gone&quot;.So we thought might as well go to drop off our bags in the room and head to one of the restaurants. The Steak place was right in our building; so we peaked in before heading up in the elevator - and while dated (check out other reviews on this subject), looked ok - had space on their reservations. Up to the room - 2 double beds - we had reserved a King. Picked up phone to call the front desk, dialed zero - and you must believe me when I say this - I experienced something that I have never experienced in staying in hotels for over 25 years (since I could afford to upgrade from a motel) - the phone rang and rang and rang. I didn't think to count - but it went on so long I started to believe something was wrong with the system. So I hung up - spent more time looking at phone - realized there was dedicated front desk key - thought to myself - &quot;oh that's why&quot; - hit that key and it started to ring - and not a word of a lie as I counted I finally gave up at 35 rings. My wife forced me to try one more time. So I tried &quot;O' again and on the 7 or 8th ring it was answered - and when I asked for front desk - was told this was the front desk. Described the situation and was told to go back down to the main floor and the Club Level attendant would help us - they would call him and explain. Down we went - found the attendant - who hadn't been called, told him we must of gotten the room of the other person with the same last name (but with dogs and kids), to which he told me - &quot;No - we only have one reservation with your name&quot;. &quot;Ok but how about our king?&quot; &quot;Sorry you reserved two doubles&quot;. &quot;No we didn't&quot;, &quot;Yes you did&quot;. &quot;Ok perhaps we made a mistake and we did - but now how can we fix it?&quot; &quot;Sorry no Kings left&quot; &quot;None?&quot; Well we have a King in the Mount Kidd building - it is a suite, with a loft and outdoor jacuzzi for two&quot;. &quot;OK, all we need is the King&quot; And then came what would be the best part: &quot;Don't worry I will upgrade you on a complimentary basis&quot; - &quot;Ok problem solved&quot;.Now to suggest this was an upgrade: is to live in an alternative universe where everything is in reverse. This building (Mount Kidd) was so dated as to be insulting to the term &quot;dated&quot;. The elevator was first clue. Blue formica in the most hideous design covered the walls - but fortunately I was distracted by the couple who joined us on the elevator - they were carrying their weight in beer. As we exited the elevator - sitting in the hallway was a microwave oven. Not sure why - but it would be there until we left the next day. The room: well the best description I can conjure is a University Dormitory without any of the &quot;Dorm charm&quot;. Hideously garish lighting (the really cheap new style bulbs), the smallest bathroom, and pitch to the stairs to the loft that I have to believe no longer would meet current building codes. The loft bed was alone - so if one needs to go to bathroom at night - well, unless you are willing to wake your partner by turning on the garish lights - best to check one's life insurance policies before attempting in the dark.We both thought &quot;this will seem better if we can get something to eat&quot; (as if our blood sugar levels would improve this horrid room). So off to the &quot;fine dining&quot; room - the Seasons Steak Room. Remember my comment about alternative universe? Dated? But just to ensure this review has some credibility - lets point out the good: excellent attentive staff, a lounge style piano player who could really sing and play, a neat setting looking out into the forest and the most fantastic Duck Fries! The steaks unfortunately were not us to snuff - but not terrible - but certainly not fining dining (and a bit weird given this is in Alberta).Back to the room, warm night, turn on the fan - which was filthy - which began to make a clicking noises. Unfortunately it was not strong enough to dissipate the smoke from the smokers who gathered right below our room (which was just above the entrance to the building - which contained a pub). Nor was the clicking noise enough to drown out the sound of the drunks who seemed to stumble around outside with the most foul language until about 2:30 AM. When I called at about 10 to ask if anything could be done (after another 15 to 20 rings) I was told there was nothing that could be done until 11 PM.At this point I realize I &quot;wanted off&quot; - so as soon I hung up - called the Sheraton Eau Claire suites (please see my next review) in Calgary and booked a reservation for the next night (that we had originally planned to stay at the Delta).Given that we had about 4 - perhaps 5 hours of sleep - the rest was a bit of blur. Fortunately we weren't so tired that we managed to avoid trip over the microwave that we still sitting in the middle of the hallway. Not sure about the Club Lounge continental breakfast - we were so exhausted we could barely raise the energy to compete with the bus load of tourist for the few remaining croissants. The check out was very nice - he didn't seem very perturbed that we forfeiting a nights rate (any price to get out was worth it to me at that point). The car valet was punctual and seemed concerned about us (perhaps was worried we were in no shape to drive). If the room had been the right one - would we have had an experience that equated to the previous reviews (that mystify me - &quot;same hotel&quot;?) - perhaps. All I know for sure as we pulled out the sun was glinting on the mountains and we were reinvigorated and exhilarated to be on the road.",-1,14,0.519397193
175176814,"It was a beautiful day for a drive to the mountains but because it is a long weekend here in Alberta we thought we would just drive to Kananaskis Country. We stopped at the Lodge with the idea of having a slice of pie or cake and a coffee. We were directed by one of the bell hops to the restaurant. We approached the hostess stand and asked if we could just have pie and coffee instead of the $35.00 buffet they were offering. The hostess told us we could go to the little shop next door is that was all we wanted. We walked next door and they little shop did not have pie and only had Starbucks coffee (we would rather drink mud). We went back to the restaurant and again they refused us service. The restaurant wasn`t even half full but we could not get our treat there We .then left and drove down the highway to the Boundary Ranch and had a lovely slice of pie and coffee and a beautiful mountain setting. Will be go back to the Lodge, not likely, will we go back to the Boundary Ranch, you bet we will.",-1,0,0.420915033
590586372,"Family of 5 with little kids, so we book adjoining rooms.  Confirmed the day before arrival. When we got to the hotel were told &quot;oh, we oversold, you can two rooms on separate floors.&quot;  We said that wouldn't work, so the solution was to cram us into a standard room.  We were part of a group and were to be provided with meal vouchers, but they forgot about those.The bathub had dirt and grass in it when we got in, and one of the shelves has nails sticking up out of the bottom which is great for both kids to play with and destroying your clothes.  Our room was over the lobby and had a view of a roof (see photo) and provided great listening to the drumming performed in the lobby that evening while trying to put kids to bed.  The room was very hot, and the thermostat was set to low temperature, when we called the front desk they advised that although air conditioning was working in the hallways, it was broken for the rooms so we should just prop the room door open.Because we were crammed into a small room, they provided a cot - the mattress of which had springs that jutted out uncomfortably.On the second day I asked the concierge for directions to one of the restaurants while holding a 3 year old, the directions were fine, but when we got to the other side of the property were then told &quot;no minors allowed&quot; - information that I could have used when asking for directions.Every morning the alarm went off at 5:59 a.m. - the first time I blamed housekeeping for not resetting and myuself for not checking, but despite both setting it to 9:00 am and turning it off, it still went off at 5:59 so perhaps not a housekeeping error after all, just one more element to the torture this hotel provided.It went on and on like that.  From the sales manager, to the front desk manager, to the front desk and concierge staff everyone who worked there seemed to be either disinterested to an amazing degree, or stupid beyond belief.",-1,3,0.494907407
178093279,"I booked the Romance getaway for my son and his new wife - they actually got married in their loft suite  and will spend their wedding night there.. My understanding when I booked was that they would be in the signature club building.  They ended up in the Mount Kidd Building and their accommodation can be best described as shabby!  The couch and chair were getting thread bare and reminded me of furniture one would find in a poor quality thrift store.  The coffee table was in even worse shape with a warped and peeling veneer top. The room was old and in desperate need of redecorating. The glass screen in the fireplace needs a good cleaning and the vacuum needs to be used under some of the furniture.  The promo that I read about this room indicated that there was a walk in shower and unless it was hiding up in the loft, all I saw was a very small, cramped and dated bathroom on the main level. The sparkling wine was to be replaced by sparking grape juice and a fruit basket - what they were given was a bottle of Perrier with ordinary wine glasses from the restaurant and a sad looking orange, an apple, some grapes and an aging banana. Not very romantic!  Not what we had expected for $300.00 + and like another reviewer wrote, Super 6 motels offer similar accommodation for a lot less. Vouchers for breakfast were to have been delivered to the room but when we left at 9 pm they had not as yet arrived.  I spoke to someone at the desk in the Signature Club about this room and he tried to contact someone from management to share my concerns with. Unfortunately, the person I needed to speak to was busy with a group that had just arrived and I needed to return to Calgary, leaving my son and his new wife to enjoy their romantic evening in their shabby accommodation.  I hope they at least get a good night's sleep.  I am not as the more I think about their accommodation, the more upset I get.  I was told that my concerns will be passed on to Mona and that she wall contact me.  I look forward to speaking with her.",-1,2,0.442915257

Room was in very poor condition, needs a major renovation.  House cleaning did not show up until 4pm to clean the room.  The food on site was overpriced and poor.

189627634,"We came to the delta last Easter weekend and had an amazing experience! We chose to make this trip a family one. We had 4 rooms together which was nice, however 2 late check ins. Our rooms were very outdated but I don't care about that as long as it is clean. The rooms were awful. One room had someone's socks left under the bed, another room had a previous guests bobby pins left on the floor. We went to use a wine glass one night and there was a wine film on it from the night before and was just put back. I left the maid 5 dollar tip and there was garbage left on the floor, nothing vacuumed or wiped. Seasons restaurant was excellent, however the others did not have good service. The fireweed must have lost our order. We waited over an hour for our food which is frustrating with kids. They did give it to us for free. The front desk somehow messed up all our bookings for an extra night but I won't say much more as my sister in law dealt with it. We did enjoy the pool and all the outdoor activities. We were planning to come back for Easter again this year but I don't think we will now. Seems very short staffed and/ or inexperienced. Everyone was apologetic and gave discounts but personally I would rather just pay, have great clean service and be able to enjoy my stay instead of frustration. ",-1,1,0.480057471

76905343,"We normally go to Banff and stay at the Fairmont Banff Springs but we wanted to change it up a bit so went to K Country last weekend. I talked to the hotel prior to booking and was advised to stay in the Executive Suite over the Deluxe Loft. Reason was that it would be nicer and was in the main lodge. As well, there were to be French doors separating the bedroom. (This is also the description on the website) When we arrived, they said the room was in Mount Kidd Manor rather than the Lodge. We went to the room and there were no doors separating the bedroom. The jacuzzi tub had lots of chipped caulking all over the floor, the screen window was completely destroyed, it had an old tv and was not at all what I would expect when paying $360 per night for the room. When I called down to ask for a room switch, I was told the hotel was sold out and he would call me back if he had an alternative. I waited 45 minutes and he didn't call so I called back and the manager was helpful- moved us to a loft suite which was suitable and a considerable improvement over the other room.My issues with this room- the balcony was completely dirty, torn screens on both the windows and patio door, the pull out sofa was covered with hair and dirt, and  the extra blanket had a huge rip in it. While the destination is beautiful, I have a hard time spending the same amount of money to stay here as I do at the Banff Springs which is exceptionally well appointed and pay attention to detail.",-1,0,0.422883598

The first impression was the lobby was dirty as was the elevator.   The seams in the carpets are worn through as we approached our room for which we paid handsomely.  That room was spartan with two pictures on the wall.  One wall had nothing on it.  The room was dark and had no character.  During the night, the room got hot and we could not cool it off and then in the morning the bathroom light did not work. Also, the restaurant food was average and bland.  I complained in the morning without nothing more than an &quot;I am sorry&quot;.  I then emailed the hotel to complain and got a response from the manager that he was out for a few days but that I could call him to discuss upon his return. Seems like he should have called me.

The rooms are very stale and out-of-date for decor. the pool/hot tub is in need of a re-build! It is not what it used to be in '88. Understandable that the closing of the gorgeous golf course there has effected the operation completely but wow, i hope re-opening of golf next summer improves the entire business.

622216108,"The Lodge benefits from a great location but fails to follow through with service, food quality and hotel amenities.  My wife &amp; I booked a two night stay in a Deluxe Guest Room with a king bed in the main building during the first week of October.  Our room was large with a recently remodeled bathroom, however the rest of the space looked to be awaiting renovation and a new bed.  Tucked in a corner was a very small table (not large enough for anything more that 2 glasses of wine) and two very uncomfortable chairs.  The television was also awaiting an update, but did a very effective job of hiding the holes in the wall where a much older TV must have been.On the first evening we chose to eat at Forte, the Italian restaurant in the hotel. We like to eat early, so made reservations for 6:30, before the restaurant got too busy. Even though the restaurant was not busy, our appetizer took 40 minutes to arrive. The remainder of our meal was not inspirational.  In addition, the wine selection is spartan and prices are excessive for what is offered.My wife wanted to visit the Nordic Spa for a massage during our stay, so shortly after checking in, we made our way to the spa only to find the first available massage date  was in mid December, 2 1/2 months away!  So if you want a massage - book early!The staff are very friendly, personable, and eager to help but some definitely lack proper training.At check out our breakfast bill did not appear on our statement even though we had eaten 45 minutes earlier, so the fellow behind the counter said since they had my credit card on file, once the charge came through he would add it to our bill and email me the statement.  That was 2 days ago and I'm still waiting.  We shouldn't mistake activity for action.  We had visited this hotel previously several years ago when it was part of the Delta chain and thoroughly enjoyed our stay and were prepared to pay the premium price to return.

Beautiful setting as always but the new owner's have a desperate amount to learn about running a luxury resort.Of our two rooms (one loft unit and one luxury king) one had no heat and one had a leaking roof. We were told that the cold room had misconnected plumbing that had been known about for a long time but not fixed. Would not have been fun at -27C even with a provided space heater.Hotel is hopelessly understaffed we both only had our rooms cleaned after 05:30 PM after we yelled. Don't know how the staff kept smiling  which is a great credit to them.Food was generally poor and expensive. The pop-up Starbucks (called the Market) was an absolute disaster.The we come to the Nordic Spa which supposedly has rave reviews. Looked very cheesy with raw wood fencing which won't last very  long. We did get some rave reviews from guests but needs a lot of work.

Although, we always paid the high price (some years booking 3 units at a time) we feel that the restaurants and stores are fabulous indoors as the mountains outdoors therefore, it sort of made up for the high price.  But not this time!  I was not happy this year!   We were sent to John Palliser building where rooms are smaller with air conditioning; the main building has good sized rooms but no air conditioning; you open window for air but you have a view of the future spa construction site with machinery and men at work. The main pool was not functioning well, the water was very cold; the floor had huge puddles of water and maintenance was at the site draining water; obviously something was very wrong.  On the other side, renovations had forced closed the usual restaurants; the only one restaurant was open only until 9:30pm.  Woody's pub opened until 2am but we could not go there because we had a 6yr old child with us.  We were forced to order in-room dining which was very expensive: one little pasta plate without any meat was $26.34 with its taxes/gratuities.  So, for one night stay and dinner that did not include wine :( we paid almost $485.00!!  That is very expensive considering we are middle class families.",-1,7,0.542222222
137623594,"Check in was not very personal, desk clerk &quot;Felipe&quot; asked me 3 times if I had stayed at the property before. Not very attentive for being front end service personnel.  The hallways were littered with old room service trays, left there a while.  There were dogs in the room next to us that were viciously barking constantly.  The pool area was nice but needed cleaning.  There were used bandaids on the deck and hair strands everywhere including the kids flutter boards.  We took a side entrance back to our room and noticed a broken wine glass and cigarette butts all over the stairs.  Little did I know, the worst of the stay was to come by eating at the Fireweed Grill!  Server was &quot;xena&quot; who did not have professional server qualities. Our drinks took 20 minutes to come after ordering, and came at the same time as our appetizer.  The kids had the &quot;kid's buffet&quot; which they liked, but be very careful letting your kids get there food! Someone left the pizza tongs under the hot light and my wife burned her hand. I ordered the &quot;newyork steak&quot; ($35), and my wife ordered the Pacific halibut.  No side plates were brought out to share the appetiizer, no dinner buns were brought out (had to ask after we got our food), had to ask for drink refills, which took another 15 minutes to arrive. My steak was full of silver skin gristle, took an hour to arrive, and was served without a steak knife or offering of pepper. I had to ask another server for a steak knife while my food got cold. The wife's halibut was just ok she said.  The wife's water refill never did come, had to give her my water. We were in no mood for dessert or coffee at this point! The kids were so bored after sitting for an hour and a half after they ate, that they were starting to play under the table; in which I noticed old cigarette bits and old food on the ground.

405229562,"We stayed in the Lodge a few times in the early 2000s and were sad to see nothing has changed or been maintained.  The location and view is so exceptional that it should trump some of the building's detractors, but sadly, it didn't.  We were on the 3rd floor of the building and there is no air conditioning in the rooms.  While we opened the window (as instructed) and kept a fan in front of it (as suggested) and even put a couple buckets of ice in front of the fan to try and cool the room down, nothing worked.  Neither of us slept the entire evenings.  Pretty basic, if people can't be comfortable in the rooms, it makes the whole experience a challenge.Now, let me talk about the state of the resort.  The carpets are tattered and worn.  The wallpaper in many sections is also lifting and showing its age.  The dark and muted sconce lighting creates an effect of dim and dingy.  Lastly, the windows don't seem to be regularly washed, as our room window had a layer of dust/water droplets and many of the windows at the resort (both in and out) need a good washing. The view is spectacular - make it easy for people to see it.  The pool and indoor/outdoor hot tub was always a favourite and is still very cool.  But... The tile is dated and grimy throughout.  The outdoor sauna reminds me of my grandparents basement sauna - is was too small and the door did not fit snugly. I understand the resort is going through a $68M renovation and this seems too small an amount to make a substantive difference to the resort and the rooms.  Not sure if we'll return to see if the renovations created any impact.  Small suggestions that could yield great returns for the resort: put coffee/infused water in your entry.  It's a small token of appreciation and welcoming to your guests.  When the only coffee jaunt doesn't open until 7 a.m., and the hot rooms keep people up all night, put out some complimentary coffee.  Many Delta Hotels put apples/fruit at the reception.  Kids love it and it's a nice decorative affect.  Again, something small but good effect.  The robes in the rooms look like they were commissioned from the Value Village - worn and tattered.  Invest in some nice plush robes that could make people feel like they were in a mountainside luxurious resort (even if it isn't).  Offer some activities for families or, at minimum, some suggestions of things to do.  Give a little map of some hiking trails, offer a morning walk/yoga session for guests, or even do some interpretive evening talks about the area.  These are all low cost - higher impact activities that could compensate for the deficiencies.  It was a disappointing stay with a high price tag.  Thankfully the view, the outdoor mountain air, and the location helped prop the hotel up, but for goodness sake, invest in making people feel they are special when they get to the resort.",-1,1,0.575768711
417560512,"So first the positives:  incredible scenery both at the hotel and the area.  Excellent souvenir/gift shops on site at the hotel.  Staff was also very friendly and helpful throughout the stay.In general, this was one of the worst, if not the worst hotels I have ever stayed at and that includes hotels in third world countries and remote northern hunting/fishing lodges.  The decor was out of the 1970's.  There was no air conditioning (they leave a broken down fan in the closet for you to use, but it is falling apart and is so loud you can probably hear it from 3-4 rooms away.  The bathtub had hair (short and curly and not a small amount of it either), even in the soap dish.  Carpet was very chewed up and coming loose in many places.  Holes (more like gouges) all over the walls and ceiling, both in the rooms and hallways.  Wallpaper was peeling off the walls in both the rooms and hallways and other common areas.  Countertop in bathroom was extremely low, making the sink very difficult to use for anybody over about 5'6&quot; (I am well over 6').  patio doors in the room would barely open and close, had to really fight with them to make them move.  Beds are awful - mattress is just laying on a homemade wooden frame, no boxspring, and the frame is much larger than the mattress which was a major hazard for shins.  Noise is horrible - you can hear almost any movement in the entire building, not just your own floor.  No elevators so you have to haul your luggage up the stairs in the heat and then get into a room that is even 10 degrees hotter and finding out about the lack of a/c.Food was edible at best.  The buffets were confusing as the food was setup in random places and not even consistently in the same places ( one night it was salads in one room, carbs in another room and meat was outside another day it was the same buffet in each place).  Hard to navigate and terribly confusing, especially with the tiny plates that you had to carry from room to room to get back to your table, so there was lots of food falling to the floor making a tripping hazard.  For the pre-ordered banquet meal at our event, the food was very good, but the portion sizes looked like we had ordered off a children's menu and many of us had to go find additional food after supper.  There was also a rumour going around that someone in our group actually found a thumbtack in their salad (I did not hear this directly, so I can't confirm it).  Drinks at any of the events were insanely over-priced, but not sure if that was set by the hotel or by our group.The conference rooms were unbelievably hot, at least 25 degrees, if not warmer, and not only was there no a/c, but there were not even fans in these rooms.  And, rather than opening the big door to have it open to walk in and out, they herded everyone (well over 100 people) through a regular size door at breaks like we were cattle during our breaks.  By the time we got out the break was almost over.After hearing about some other peoples' rooms who were staying in the main building, they had very large, nice, air conditioned rooms, so make sure that you request an upgrade if you plan to enjoy your stay.",-1,1,0.51284093
417202033,Kananaskis country is probably one of the most beautiful places on this planet. The Delta hotel &quot;could&quot; be but most definitely is not worth the $400 a night we paid for a double queen. The hotel is in a beautiful setting but is most definitely past it's prime and needs a great deal of work. Charging that kind of money for what was one our worst hotel experiences ever should be a crime. What we didn't pay for was the following:- Wedding party outside our window - ROARING even after the loud music was shut down- drunken loud mouths till 3:00 am when the rain/snow started. If it hadn't been for the snow I am sure it would have gone all night long.- Air conditioning that was so loud and ineffective that we had to keep the windows open - and the unit itself looked like it had seen better days by far- which made the wedding noise even worse- towels that felt like sandpaper- two glasses - two paper cups in a quad room- we had 3 people- Hotel maintenance is definitely lacking- when it started to rain it came pouring off the roof- since the eavestroughs were in disrepair- causing even more of a racket-Parking was lacking - cars and vehicles were parked on the grass and on roadways since their wasn't enough parking available- Food was just ok but the prices were ridiculous for what was essentially mediocoreOn the positive the staff seemed pleasant and helpful. So to sum up - HIGH PRICE for a sleepless night in what is essentially a 2 star hotel,-1,2,0.567055853
416332927,This was supposed to be a resort lodge. The only thing I found favorable about the room was the beds. They were super comfortable. The first thing we noticed when entering the room was the smell. Too much cover up spray or something so we had to open the window for at least an hour. There was no tissues in the tissue box. The carpet had stain spots on it. There were not many outlets for our electronic gadgets and they were in inconvenient locations. The refrigerator was as noisy as the guests in the room next door. I was in room 2313. There was no air conditioning but fortunately we didn't need it. The worst thing though was the shower. There was standing water that wouldn't drain. I reached under the drain stopper and found there was hair blocking the water from draining. I started pulling it out after my shower and it just kept coming and coming. There was more than a whole head of long hair in that drain. It hadn't been cleaned in years. The shower tiles also had mold. Our breakfast had watery eggs and no meat. I would not recommend this hotel based on its lack of cleanliness.,-1,0,0.56
335478750,We stayed Dec 24-26. We enjoyed Christmas Eve with the Bow Valley Carolers singing and our meals at Grappa. However there were a number of things that were a major deterrent: many families had one to three dogs. It is not a vacation for us when the dogs are barking late at night and 6:00 in the morning. Not to mention dogs with their behinds all over the carpets that other people share (think sock feet). One guest had a rabbit- on a leash  - but being walked in public areas. This same person also took the rabbit into the Fireweed restaurant just as we were going in for Christmas dinner. We left the restaurant as that was over the top for us (think  rabbit droppings being stepped on and drug all over). We haven't been there for two years and noted the hotel is old looking and in need of a Reno in public areas. This used to be one of our favorite vacation spots but at $474 per night it simply isn't worth it any more. We will not return to this hotel.On a general note it took years for hotels to become non smoking and I believe they saved a lot of money in cleaning. BUT now we have animals in public areas and rooms sharing dander etc with everyone. In my opinion this is a new public health issue. Before anyone get's upset note that I have had dogs and 27 rabbits and currently have a cat but I leave them at home when I go on vacation.Sylvia,-1,2,0.353748006
276570770,"We planned for a family weekend in the mountains when my spouseâs mother was visiting so we booked at Delta Lodge Kananaskis. We booked through Expedia as the room rate was significantly cheaper. When we arrived, we asked Guest Services for a close and easy 2-3 hour hike for our group with older individuals in it. We went to the hike recommended by Guest Services. Upon returning to our vehicle after the hike, the car window had been smashed and all of our belongings from the car were stolen (including wallets, phones and our house keys). The police urged us to drive home and have our locks changed immediately. We returned to the Delta Lodge and asked for a bag and tape to cover the window before driving home. We asked if we could either get a refund for our stay or rebook for another weekend. This seemed like a reasonable request considering the situation. However, the Delta Lodge Guest Services representative told us that they felt really bad for us so they would offer us a free continental breakfast if we decided to stay. Seriously? He said that because we booked through Expedia, this is the best his Supervisor could offer. We said we would absolutely NOT be staying because the police had urged us to go home and have our locks changed. Not to mention, we did not even have wallets to be able to get ourselves dinner or phones to call and cancel credit cards, etc. When we came down with our luggage and checked out, we were told we had to wait for the Supervisor. With absolutely no regard for our situation, they had us wait for 15 minutes for the Supervisor to come out and tell us that we could not rebook our reservation for another time as there is no exchange of money between the Delta and Expedia. This is ridiculous and how it has anything to do with us being able to come back to the Delta Lodge at another time and stay in a room that we already paid for is beyond me. The Supervisor gave us his business card and told us that if we end up wanting to rebook for another weekend, he could offer us a discounted rate depending on when we would be willing to stay. This is pathetic customer service. Especially for an expensive resort.  This would have been our 4th time staying at the Delta Lodge and we will NEVER stay at the Delta Lodge nor recommend it to anyone again. There are plenty of great places to stay in the Rockies. In the summer of 2014, there were close to 60 vehicle break-ins in Kananaskis, so this situation is not highly unlikely. If you find yourself in the same unfortunate situation that we were in, you will be happy that you did not choose to stay at the Delta Lodge.",-1,1,0.67662037
149131785,"If you are looking for a nice relaxing weekend do not book here.  We recently stayed and the amount of children in this resort is unreal.  Sadly, the parents do not think they are the ones responsible for their own children.  You cannot even go to the lounge to get away from the kids because the lounge allows minors.  If you want to take your kids and join in on the chaos you may love this place.  If you are looking to party all weekend long and room hop, stay here as well.  The mix of unruly children by day and even more unruly adult children by night is outstanding if that is your thing.  You cannot turn down the heat in most of the rooms so you cannot even hide in your room comfortably if you tried.  Value for dollar is poor, this hotel is in major need of an upgrade.  If you are a smoker go to the public above ground parking lot side of the lodge, the mountain of cigarette buts is astonishing, I guess the Management are not really concerned about fire hazards or appearances.  I am so disappointed by what this lodge is sold as on the internet and what it really has to offer.  Save your money and stay in Canmore!",-1,1,0.546693122

We have come here faithfully each year for the past 20 years and have noted a decline that is expected with ageing facilities. The 'lodge' experience has always been something we as a family eagerly anticipated. The dining options, the small games room, a clean sauna, relatively clean carpets, gift shops, music and the general sociability that goes along with people occupying a communal space - laughter, kids running around, old couples holding hands and so forth. We just arrived and it feels as if the entire property is under construction. The options are severely limited, the complementary service at the Signature Club absent, construction dust and dirt everywhere. Do I need to wear construction boots from my room to go to the sauna? Oh wait, the telltale suds floating on the water are not inviting. The place is absent of laughter and the good cheer. Why on earth did reservations did not say anything about the renovations when I booked the room? The staff are obviously well intentioned but clearly overwhelmed.

He asked me to call long distance but unfortunately I don't have a plan to call long distance so asked hi to contact me during a certain time.

390582291,"Was really looking forward to our stay here but was disappointed at almost every turn with a few exceptions. We are experienced and regular travellers. At $300 per night, the value was extremely poor and this makes the experience disappointing. The good: The staff and customer service were excellent minus a few exceptions like the person who checked us out and the breakfast was good except the over pricing of coffee and juice. The bad: Our room was incredibly hot even though we left the curtains closed and the window open and used a fan. We commented at the front desk after the first night and were told that for $50 more per night, we could be upgraded to a renovated room in another building that had air conditioning. It would have been a lot of work to move our belongings and we didn't feel it fair to be charged another $50 per night for something that should have already been included. We suffered for our next 2 nights and our sleep quality was affected. If I was the manager, I would have solved this problem and apologized to our customer for the inconvenience. We went to Grappa for our first supper there. They were out of basil and meatballs. Our server was great but the chef was rude to him when he asked a question which was uncomfortable to witness. Our first breakfast took 30 minutes after we ordered which out us behind schedule for the days events. Our room was outdated and the light in the bathroom was falling apart. There were not enough plug ins for our devices. A problem that is easily resolved with the lights that have plug ins in them at most other hotels. There was no fan in the bathroom which made the room hotter after a shower. The water in the shower took a long time to warm up. This hotel describes itself as &quot;upscale&quot; but it really wasn't. I feel misled and don't feel this property is up to the standard of other Marriot hotels we have stayed at. I really wish I would have booked in Banff. I would have spent the same amount of money for a better quality experience.

The maintenance man who finally did show up would just push the issue off to staff the next day.  After two nights of frustration, I had to go outside to the other building to find a manager who moved me to a new room.  It was also beautifully renovated, everything worked except the heat.  I ended up freezing in 60 degree temps for 2 days.  Staff in the restaurants are all pleasant, and the food was yummy, however service was very very slow.  The room rate should have been reduced to reflect the fact that I was staying in what were obviously hastily finished rooms and the staff were not prepared to provide service to the number of guests.

It was while we were packing to leave that we noticed a letter from the hotel manager that they were experiencing unseasonably warm weather and offering suggestions on how to keep the room cool.  I wish they had followed those suggestions before we got there and cooled our room off!In the end, I wish someone had warned us that there was no AC and I wish someone at the hotel had at least apologized for the omission and for all the problems we experienced, which could have been very serious medically for my brother.  They didn't and when I called to check out the following morning all I got was a rather brusque &quot;okay&quot; and not apology or commiseration of any kind.So, the facility seems to be first class with plenty of amenities and the room is nice as well.  With the one exception of having no AC.  It would probably be a great place to stay, if very expensive, except in the summer months.One final caveat, buy gas before you get there since the nearest gas station is about 20 kilometers away and the gas is much, much more expensive than you could by elsewhere.</span><span class=""taLnk ulBlueLinks moreBtn"" onclick=""widgetEvCall('handlers.clickExpand', event, this);"">More</span>",-1,1,0.529830918

Well, they don't have any food available on the premises past 11 PM. The closest pizza place is 45 minutes away, and quite frankly in the weather we were experiencing I wasn't prepared to have someone drive on those roads just to bring me a pizza. So I decide to call it a night. Then rolls around 2:45 AM, when a fire alarm goes off? We look into the hallway to other confused customers and wonder what to do? There's no instructions, just a loud alarm. Finally 10 minutes later it shuts off with nothing that follows. Then again at 3:10 AM the alarm goes off for 2-3 minutes. At this point we're just laughing wondering what else can go wrong? Waking up the next morning we decide to head down to the hot tub to relax a little before driving home. Oh that's still closed for renovations, and the wait to get into the Nordic spa pools is 2-5 hours. So we decide to just pack our things and head out.

The bathroom had so soap as such, just plunge soap from the canister and only two small thin towels for two of us. The shower front had dropped off and could do with a good clean. Now..this is uber bad bit. If you like sleeping in a hotel where the sound of cheesey disco and house music is relentless you'll love this place. At night the music just gets louder and louder and louder to the point where you are almost driven out of the room in despair. It was like sleeping in a nightclub to which the room is directly above. There is NO soundproofing. Also if you open the window for air all you get is the locals screaming and squealing at a taxi rank outside the window. Also at Â£70 per room it was not cheap. No breakfast either. I have to admit this is the worst hotel I ever stayed in and I ended up at the Holiday Inn for breakfast. Never again. Two days of no sleep, doors banging, shouting and snoring from other rooms plus the room we were was next to communal toilet so that was going all night with some bad plumbing.",-1,0,0.511755952
255418729,"I feel we were extortionately over charged for this very small room &amp; extremely creaky cheap bed, not to mention the deafening music from the nightclub below (it felt like one of the speakers was actually in our room), every 20 minutes the bottle bins were emptied just beneath our window which sounded like a car was coming crashing through the window.  There was a dog wondering around the pub and the upstairs area and the next morning we woke from voices in the neighbouring room, the upstairs area stank of smoke, obviously other guests were smoking in their rooms.  On the evening when we returned, the bar was closed and we had to enter the hotel via the side door which was right next to where people were hanging around smoking from the nightclub and 2 girls nearly started fighting. We were charged Â£95 for 1 nights stay in this tiny room, which I think is disgraceful especially not having prior warning that we wouldn't actually be able to sleep in this hotel until turned 5 in the morning!!   When bringing this to the attention of the Hotel Manager I was told this was my own fault for not doing my research!!  Should I really have to research to find out that you cannot actually SLEEP in a hotel?  The Hotel Manager was very rude in her response and not once did she apologise for the terrible stay we had.I see on other reviews that people have paid Â£30 for a night's stay in this so called Hotel, if we had paid Â£30 I would have put it down to experience and thought I got what I paid for.I would not recommend this hotel.",-1,5,0.457123961

The bathroom is so small it only just fit one in at a time. There are no toiletries - just hand soup for both sink and shower. Toilet paper is placed in a holder like those in a public loo. The one in my room smells very musty and mildewy. There are no wardrobes or desks. TV is mounted up in the ceiling. Door is paper thin - only held shut with a lock. The noise from the bar and nightclub runs all night.  The floor was 'sticky' when I had to push a bed away to make room for my suitcase. There's wifi but the signal doesn't work if you don't stand close to the door! Stay only if you must. Hotel entrance is through a bar through a not very obvious door - through the door and up a flight of stairs to reception. The hall is very narrow so don't bring a big suitcase. Reception is located where it used to be a sitting room. All rooms run along this narrow corridor.,-1,1,0.488960114

This is listed as a specifically gay friendly hotel which would make sense due to being in the heart of Canal Street, Manchester. We started out night at the pub and had our first few drinks in the pub section to the left. There is a night club to the right with a DJ and dance floor etc. Once we moved into there, we noticed they had poles. My 2 friends had a quick go, just for a bit of fun. The drag queen who was working as a DJ turned the must off and told them they werenât all that and they should stop. They thought it was just banter as you would expect and continued. My partner was actually told a second time to get off the pole and it wasnât a suggestion. This was also followed by rude comments about âputting her trottersâ away. The drag queen continued to joke to other guests and make rude, offensive and derogatory comments towards us.I did email a complaint to the bar/hotel twice but no response. Overall, the place was awful. Rude and abusive staff.

The next day I called into the pub and asked for my earphones, it was the same lady from the day before and the same lady I had spoken to on the phone. &quot;Yes, yes&quot; she said &quot;I put them on the shelf up here behind the bar&quot; And as she started searching I could tell by her expression that they weren't where she left them.

The whole trip was a birthday present and this seemed like the ideal location.I paid a deposit before I got there and when we did arrive, we got shown to our room which was dark and dingy. It only had a small window which didn't open very wide. I had to go to the pound shop to stock up on antibacterial wipes and bleach because the bathroom was disgusting. The shower door was literally about to fall off and there was barely any room to swing a cat.Anyway, we went shopping and I noticed I had 3 missed calls on my phone from the hotel. When i called them there was no answer. We got back to the hotel a few hours later and the manager knocked on our door and told us we hadn't paid enough money to secure our booking. I went up with him to the office to pay what needed to be paid when he asked me for the full amount. Surely the deposit would be enough to secure your booking. We hadn't even been there for one full day yet and he wanted me to pay for the whole 4 day trip. Biggest regret now is that I did, because after 4 full days they wouldn't have got half of what they were charging.In four days, our bedsheets were changed once. And that was only because we asked for them to be changed. The tea tray was never changed so we sat with dirty cups in our room for 4 days. The bin wasnt changed so we were filling up tesco bags with rubbish which we had to set beside the wall. It was too cold to leave the window half open all day so the room started to smell because it wasn't being cleaned.Vile, disgusting place. I complained to the hotel and didn't hear anything back. Will NEVER stay in this dirty disgusting hotel ever again. Oh and the breakfast that we paid Â£4 each for on the first morning.....2 cold rounds of toast and butter and a cup of tea. Do one....they saw us coming with that one!",-1,1,0.529301587

When i rang to book a room, the person who answered said &quot; Ive got to go downstairs, give me your number and il ring you back &quot;, a week later he hadnt rung back. Now im sure that getting Â£40 custom was more important than whatever he was doing. We finally got the room booked. We finally got there, we got checked in, he showed us to our room ( room 3 so please avoid! ) and said &quot; the shower is broken but if you fiddle with it, it will work &quot;, baring in mind that there were about 20+ empty rooms with showers that worked which we could have gone in. As soon as i walked into the room, the first thing i said to my partner was &quot; they could have hoovered &quot;, the floors were covered in dust and well, heaven knows what. I went to sort the shower out and the highest temperature it would go to was 20 degrees, which is rather cold! I ended up rinsing my hair with a kettle, which was rather dangerous but i had no other choice. I was doing my hair whilst sat on one of the chairs, baring in mind i had a pair of 190 degree hair straighteners in my hand, and the chair leg just came loose and i ended up on the floor with a cut up my arm. I checked the chair and it seems that the hotel knew the chair was broken but had just propped the chair leg into position and hoped nothing would happen to anyone. I sat on bed, or should i say rectangle of springs, its possibly the worst bed i have every laid on. The curtains only went down about three quaters of the windows which defies the object of curtains if you ask me. They provide tea and coffee facilities in the rooms but i couldnt use my cups as they were disgustingly filthy, i wouldnt have used them even if i had washed them! At night, the music went on all night and into the early morning which i could cope with. Do NOT stay here if : You have children with you : If you want a decent shower : If you want to leave un-injured : If you want a good nights sleep.

When we arrived we were taken into a grotty reception room by the lady working there called Adele. She couldn't even manage to crack a smile, it just looked like she couldn't be bothered to deal with us. My friend had paid a deposit of Â£20 for the 4 of us to stay in a room which had been booked months before hand. Adele couldn't find in her diary that this deposit had been paid (although we wouldn't have been able to reserve the room if a deposit hadn't been paid). She went on to say there were two diaries which are used and the place was a bit of a mess. She went out to look for this other diary but couldn't find it, so instead came back and said ''i can't find that you have left a deposit so i will have to charge you the full amount and if you find that you have paid let me know.'' Completely unacceptable! It was her job to find that a deposit has been made or even make a note of it in the first place. How is it acceptable that the customer would have to may more than the confirmed amount because she can't find where she noted the deposit?! After that myself and 2 other friends had to pay the remainder for our stay. We were each paying on card and hadn't been to a cashpoint as we had finished work and headed straight down to manchester, not that that should have been an issue. When we explained that we needed to pay separately Adele said 'oh i don't want to take 3 separate payments' whilst pulling a face. Well we'd have been happy to not pay at all if she preferred. What kind of host says this to a customer when that customer is staying in your hotel and keeping your business running by staying there. She was completely rude and not customer friendly at all. In the end we made two separate payments on card which she was happy to do so what was wrong with doing 3 payments i'll never know.We had one room for 4 people yet there were only 2 towels? Were we expected to share two towels between 4? 3 men and 1 woman? There was tea and coffee for 4 people but no milk so we didn't use any of this in our two day stay. The pillows were hard and the hotel is far too noisy from the bar underneath. The windows were dirty but the main part that ruined it was Adeles attitude.We will not be staying here again that's for sure.

But for the Â£100 extra I wouldn't bother just because it has a living room area. The problems that we encountered were the following:1) There is no sign outside the hotel with their name and even though the address is 101 Portland str, the reception entrance is from Princess str. We told the hotel receptionist that we were walking up and down Portland str in the rain and no one knew that hotel (everyone was mentioning the MacDonald hotel by the train station). She said that the hotel has recently changed ownership and they need planning permission to put a sign up.2) We arrived at 12pm and they wouldn't let us check in (which is according to their policy) but we were soaking wet by walking 30minutes in the rain and the best they could offer was the hand dryers in the toilets.3) When we checked in our room (5pm) I've realised that the bedroom didn't have a window! There is a curtain and a background light. First time in my life I've slept in what I would only describe as a &quot;box&quot;.4) It wasn't as described on the MacDonald website. The website mentioned about a Nespresso Coffee maker &amp; iPod docking station but the hotel said they don't have such items. I told them that they should remove them from their website and a week later it's still on there. 5) There was no mini bar which is the first I've seen in a suite!6) I was also surprised that in the bathroom they only gave you complimentary shampoo and shower gel. Even in standard rooms you normally get body cream, cotton pads or buds. 7) The most important thing was the cleaningness of the bed. We removed the duvet and there were thoughts of hair and 2 out of the 6 pillows had stains on them.So for Â£179 per night I would definitely NOT recommend this hotel to anyone.",-1,3,0.471681097

225289633,"We stayed at the Macdonald Townhouse Hotel for 4 nights over the August Bank Holiday, Pride weekend in Manchester.The hotel is perfectly situated, right in the middle of all the action, although it is surrounded by 24 hour bars and clubs and busy roads - so be prepared for the room to be very noisy from dusk until dawn as there is no sound insulation from the outside street noise.It really looks the part, feels luxurious and the staff are mostly always smiling and friendly.The room was great, nicely furnished and with a large, very comfortable bed. We were on the top floor (room 513) which was good as it was slightly quieter than lower rooms.First impressions were excellent. The room looked luxurious and we though we had struck it lucky staying in such a fantastic looking place... But then it all went very, very wrong...Our toilet did not flush. Well, it did, when you worked out you had to pump the flush button 20 times, leave for 30 seconds and then push again. This process then had to be repeated depending on what was in the bowl.The bathroom was of a very bad design with the toilet sitting right next to the bath, blocking the only entry point to the bath / shower. The options are to squeeze between the tiny gap between the bath and toilet - if youâre small enough, or stand on the toilet to enter the bath, or jump over the toilet - an accident waiting to happen. Very strange - had the toilet and shower / shower screen been at the same end of the bath access would have been perfect, but somehow it was the wrong way round.The thermostatic shower fluctuated from freezing cold to scalding hot, no matter what temperature it was set on.We mentioned these issues to reception - who advised: âYou just have to get used to it.âWe managed for 3 days, but by our 3rd night, the taps had run dry, the toilet would not flush at all and there was no water in the shower. There was no running water at all. We couldn't even clean our teeth or wash our hands, let alone take a shower!Unable to contact reception by phone, I went down to speak with them.Their response was to look at me as if I was a complete idiot, that no one else had reported any issues and therefore it must be my fault. âAre you sure you know how to work the taps and the toilet flush?&quot;, I was askedâ¦After a lot of perseverance, I insisted that we needed water in the room. The response - &quot;Go to the bar and get it yourselfâ.After a 10 minute wait at the bar, whilst the slowest barman in the World served the only 2 people there, he walked off and told me to wait if I wanted anything. He eventually returned. I explained the lack of water story and he looked at me as if I was a complete imbecileâ¦ I asked for a jug of tap water. He turned on the tap and nothing came out - Bingo ! Someone finally believed me ! The receptionist and barman were clueless - they tried calling the duty manager, but there didnât seem to be one - just voicemail.I went to bed incredibly annoyed, frustrated and dirty.By morning, our toilet resembled a stinking Glastonbury style Portaloo, but we now had water ! Only it was a dark orange / brown colour. Too disgusting to actually use for anything. We managed to clear the toilet by repeating the pump x 20, flush process many times, but the water in the bowl still remained brown.At 08:30, before breakfast, we asked to speak with the manager - very friendly and smiley - she admitted the water stop cock had been turned off some time ago and the hotels water tanks had run dry, so the whole hotel had been without running water for who knows how long, but it wasn't an issue because we were the only ones who had reported it. Anyway - it wasn't the hotels fault, it was the water board. Also there was no problem with our toilet flush, it was just us, we weren't using it correctly, but she would get someone to look at it.Frustrated, we left the hotel after breakfast to find uniformed police everywhere. A police van and squad car were parked outside reception and it felt like a serious crime scene. We were later told by management that this is normal as police get free tea and coffee at the hotel. A very nice greeting if you were just arriving !  After a fabulous day out in Manchester, we arrived back to find our toilet still not flushing properly. Again, I complained to reception, but was told to: âStop causing trouble and just get on with itâ.Upon returning from our evening out, the operations manager met us and gave us the same old story, that none of these issues were their problem, the toilet flush was fine (it still wasn't)  but he did offer us another tiny room for bathroom facilities - with a real working toilet - that we could use for our last night. Unfortunately the room was on the opposite side of the hotel to our room and the bed was tiny, so we couldn't sleep in it.  The toilet did work, but you couldnât use it during the night without getting up, dressed and going for a long walk through public areas. Useless.The following day we were glad to be leaving, and as we checked out, the receptionist cheerily said - âI hope you enjoyed your stay!ââ¦Breakfast at the hotel is unbelievably expensive at Â£19.95 each, plus an additional Â£2.75 if you wanted anything other than the standard breakfast, plus a Â£5 tray charge if you wanted it in your room, plus a Â£3 credit card charge upon checkout. Luckily we had breakfast included in our rate, but if we hadnât, this is definitely the most expensive breakfast we have encountered anywhere in the World.We thought we had booked into a &quot;luxury boutique hotel&quot;, what we got was a Glastonbury style bathroom experience crossed with improved Youth Hostel style facilities on our last night. Had we realised this in advance we definitely would not have stayed at the Macdonald Townhouse.The final word from the hotel manager came in an email I received the day after we returned home, where he did apologise for our experience, but again denied all blame, insisting all our problems were outside of his control or of our own making, but he would offer us compensation of a preferential rate next time we stayed (he didn't say what the rate would be!). What a useless gesture !I have since tried to contact Macdonald Hotels central Customer Services department and their general manager via email, but just get an âOut of Officeâ message. I've heard nothing more - out of sight, out of mind... Clearly, the central customer service department and general manager have the same levels of customer service as the hotels!Please think twice about booking this hotel - it may look luxurious and the rooms seem nice at first glance, but as soon as a problem occurs, no one is interested. Check out the other negative reviews on TripAdvisor as their lack of customer service, inability to deal with a problem, problems with water pressure and temperature and extreme street noise levels seem a common theme. This is only an edited version of our lowlights, the actual experience was much worse. We have come away feeling extremely frustrated and angry that the hotel still will not agree we endured major issues. In fact they are implying that we made it all up.Running water and a working toilet are the absolute minimum I expect from a hotel - especially one that badges itself as a luxury boutique hotel! Having stayed in hundreds of hotels all over the World, never have we encountered such a bad experience and never has it been dealt with in such a terrible way - ie. totally ignored!A lot of people obviously do enjoy this hotel, but trust me, if something goes wrong, the staff - from management downwards are not interested. And in our case, things went very, very wrong.No more MacDonald hotels for us Iâm afraidâ¦On a plus note, we loved Manchester, it's a fantastic city and we did stay at the Piccadilly Travelodge Hotel the night before we checked into the MacDonald Townhouse. It was a superb experience, fantastic position right in the centre of everything, spotlessly clean, amazing views across Piccadilly Gardens and the BIG wheel, excellent staff and service, silent large rooms, fully working bathrooms with powerful showers and great breakfasts - all at a fraction of the price.

Hours later we arrived back at the hotel to an unprofessional manager muttering to a colleague behind the reception displeasantries about customers! Still no apology. We checked into our rooms, that were now finally correct. One of them was above a nightclub, and frankly it was like being on the dance floor all night. It's was definitely all about the bass that night!Breakfast was an absolute joke. After waiting a significant length of time to be seated and to be given coffee... which was cold! Any service was non-existent. The food wasn't much better either. All in all the worst hotel I've ever stayed in.

The window itself offered no view as the glass was opaque from top to bottom - very unusual. There was a lot of noise from the street below which seemed to dissipate around one o'clock in the morning. I could not identify exactly where the noise was coming from due to the opaque glass.In the en suite bathroom, there were no toiletries - except some shampoo and soap which a previous guest had used &amp; left at the end of the bath.  I was pushed for time that evening and therefore did not mention these 'issues' with the Front Desk staff on duty.

367549103,"As my firm is based in Manchester, I have to come to the city quite often and I get to try all the hotels in the area.This one is, at best, very poor. Unfortunately, I booked there for 8 nights, gladly cut by a weekend in London.The first room I had during my first week was a double bed room. As I arrived, I saw the room had not been cleaned at all. There was dust everywhere (I am allergic), spots on the different tables, spots on the walls and chairs, the beds had been ripped... The worst was the bathroom: shower leaking, having mold, the toilets had been cleaned partially (where you can see it at a glance...). So I complained. I received an apology from the Relationship manager, with some chocolate strawberries and a little bottle of wine. I appreciated the gesture, but the room was still not clean enough for a 4 star hotel.The breakfast, which I had paid in advance, was poor: you have to add Â£2.75 to get Eggs Benedict, and the chef does not know the time to get good boiled eggs...As for my second stay after my weekend in London, the lady at the reception forgot to ask me about the breakfast. When realising it at night, I called the reception and they answered even though it was their fault, I had to get down to the reception to pay for it, otherwise I would pay the full Price. Well, Philipott's around the corner was better and much cheaper! Finally, I had to ask for a wake-up call that same time for the morning after... Which I never received.Conclusions : - staff is nice but unprofessional and not helpful : don't ask for anything.- The place was supposed to have been renovated not long ago; it already looks crappy.- Check multiple times the cleanliness of the room, or you'll get mushrooms...- Forget the breakfast, too expensive for what you will get",-1,5,0.483122605

It is billed as a &quot;boutique hotel in a historic building&quot; but is in reality a poorly converted, characterless warehouse sandwiched between the busiest road and noisiest clubs in the city. Noisy: My room was few metres from a club that featured drunken brawls, a police visit and non-stop music until four in the morning.This was a Thursday night. Sleep was impossible as the rubbish collection is made at five. What is genuinely shocking is that the owners have made no attempt to sound-proof the rooms; the single-glazed sash windows do not close properly and are accompanied by a poorly-fitting glass panel without a seal. The result? Wind whistling through the gaps to accompany the noise of people swearing and fighting.Dirty: Mould all around a bath that had been crudely painted with cream paint to disguise areas of damage (already flaking, so that pieces floated in the bath water!).Dreadful: Lack of a proper lobby, restaurant that has the atmosphere of a morgue and front desk staff who blithely deny that there is any noise problem at the hotel (see other postings).

160431803,"I was going to be in Manchester, alone, on business so I wanted a hotel that was central and comfortable.  The positive reviews I read about the MacDonald Townhouse made this seem a good choice.  It is well located on the junction of two main roads.  Unfortunately, the room I had on the first night [a Classic] did not have double glazing man enough to block out the traffic noise from the busy arterial highways or the drunks wandering up and down the street.  I spoke to reception at 4:50am to say that I could not possibly stay there the following night and they would either have to move me to another room or I would find somewhere else.  I was 'upgraded' to an Executive Room.  This meant that there was a bit more space around the bed and the bathroom, instead of having a shower over the bath, had a separate [very small] shower cubicle. The black bathroom was challenging when it came to applying make up but then decor was not really to my taste.  Dark and trend looks great in well lit professional photos but is rather depressing if you have to stay in it for any length of time with nothing else to look at.  And, horror of horrors, on the second evening I lay on my bed, too tired to do anything but watch TV to find......the Tv didn't work.  A hour or so later, having had replacements televisions and new remotes, I was told that only a few channels worked because there was a 'city-wide problem' with broadcasting. Still, I was so exhausted, I guess it didn't really mater.  The beds are very comfortable but the bedlinen looked to me as though it had reached the end of its serviceable life. Clean but well used.  Room service was patchy.  One night my steak sandwich was delicious.  On the second night, I bit into it and gagged on such a large amount of fat that I lost my appetite.  I phoned to complain and asked how the chef who put the sandwich together could possibly have thought the person eating it would not notice that the ratio of fat to meat was going in the wrong direction.  There was no satisfactory reply to that but I wasn't charged for it.  When it came to paying the bill, I said that I was not prepared to pay in full for the first night because I had had no sleep and the opening day of my course was ruined by tiredness.  I did say that I would pay for everything else.  The chap on the desk at the time said he could not authorise a 'discount'; that, if I couldn't sleep, I should have asked to be moved in the middle of the night and that payment of my bill would have to wait for the manager to ring me the following day.  I was assured that my card would not be charged.  I got a phone call three days later while I was in the middle of Sunday lunch.  It was not convenient to speak then and I asked for a ring back during business hours the following day to discuss the final payment.  I am still waiting.  However, I discovered when my credit card statement arrived - to my disgust - that I had, in fact, been charged IN FULL on the very day that I checked out, despite assurances to the contrary.  In my world, this is appalling business practice.

The bedrooms are OK but if you get a room at the front of the hotel there is insufficient glass to keep the noise from the street out.  It was like being in New York, traffic all night, Friday night revelers shouting, and when I finally got some peace - around 5am - the bin men started.Dinner was awful.  I ordered steak with a pepper sauce and frankly it looked more like gravy than pepper sauce.  I sent the first one back and another arrived - similarly awful.  I sent that back as well and the waiter was almost surprised that I didn't like it - I even offered to go and show the chef how to cook a proper sauce!!A member of our group arrived at 9.35pm and joined us at the table.  We asked if she could chose from the menu but were told that the kitchen closed at 9.30pm.  They were not in the least bit helpful.  I was amazed at their lack of customer service.  My guest had travelled up from London and was offered a pudding!!  The funny thing is that there appears to be an extensive room service menu that you can have in your room until 10pm but you can't get anything in the restaurant.  I offered to go and call room service for my guest but she declined.Since I was leaving at 8am I had asked the receptionist if I could order some breakfast from the room service menu.  She advised that they do not start until 8am on a Saturday but she said the chef was in from 7am and she would make sure I got some food before I left.  I put the card on the door and 7.45am came and went and even when I was checking out at just gone 8am there was still no sign of any breakfast.Its expensive for what it is, the reception staff were helpful but ineffective!

I trekked lots of luggage from the nearest open air NCP.... up the stairs to reception (no help offered even though reception staff quite clearly observed this). Checked in to room 216. The room was very small and strangely had an opaque, 'greyed' out sash window. Therefore no view and zero natural light. I decided on dinner in the hotel bar- the seared tuna nicoise was excellent. Back to the room for an early night as I'd got a busy day planned. It soon went down hill- with a bang! Literally. The noise from the club opposite/ behind the hotel from 11pm onwards was awful- particularly bad from 2.30 - 4am !! Shouting, vile language and general disturbance. I had just dropped off when at 6am the bottle bins were emptied. On checkout I was asked how my stay was. I explained my disappointment and asked for an explanation. The receptionist explained that they were aware of this problem with this room. Really?! Why charge almost Â£200 for a room only/ no gym/ no breakfast/ no parking for a room with ridiculous noise issues! And admit it! I was insulted that basically I'd been ripped off.

Forget what you read from the Manager about a lively central location as mitigation for ambient noise; there is nothing ambient about it, it's full on pretty much 24/7.  I was on the top floor in the mansard roof.  First impressions were good, clean, tidy, good bed, equipped bathroom.  However, when it came to sleep it was obvious that despite the double glazing, no one had bothered to insulate the walls and roof by using mass (concrete or other) as a sound shield.  Oxford Rd is a major road, Princess Street also, plus there are bus stops outside which are in use at least 20 hours a day.  I can honestly say this was the worst nights' sleep I have ever had in a hotel.  Students fighting outside until the small hours, buses stopping and pulling away all night.  Horrific.  I was booked in for 2 nights but checked out after 1 and canned the stay as a bad experience.  The central reservation of the M60 is quieter.  There is no excuse for this in a hotel.  Stay in a Premier Inn near the station, similar location but they didn't skimp on the construction when the built the place.Staff were welcoming at the front desk and initially very helpful.  However, when I checked out and asked whether housekeeping could re-make my room as my colleague had said it was likely to be better then hers (she was on the first floor above the bar, same issues), no deal as they were &quot;flat out&quot; apparently with only 4 staff on duty.

The turkey was great but there was no gravy available. The worst bit was the dessert which was Christmas pudding, the chefs had managed to cremate the sauce so you could smell burnt food as it was brought in and it tasted disgusting. When we complained to the staff, they shrugged and did not apologise, they didn't even bother clearing the dishes.

240901443,"So after being in Europe for a few weeks, I decided to go to Manchester, UK for a bit of &quot;holiday&quot; as the brits call it.    I have never been to the Manchester/NW England area and just wanted to go someplace people spoke English and I could have a bit of adventure......So I booked this hotel based on rating on Trip Advisor.  I do have to say that for the most part, the rating and evaluations are true, but as i was there for 10 days, I started seeing things that were just too inconsistent to give them a 4.  But if I had been there for 3 - 4 days they probably would have maintained the 4.  So check in was great.  The clerk was friendly and helpful. She definitely has a strong accent and half the time I didn't even think she was speaking English.   I had booked a larger room and got a corner room on the 4th floor.  The room was EXTREMELY large, but wasn't furnished well.  There was a table with two chairs, but no desk and do dresser for my clothes.   There was a &quot;lounge&quot; chair that I has to use to store clothes on.   In the TV stand area, there were shelves that you possibly could have used to store clothes, but it was filled with the safe, coffee maker and other items.      The bathroom appeared nice.   It had one of the partial glass doors and a rainfall shower that you ended up stepping on the drain to shower and forcing the water to fill the tub and the water splashing off your body gets all over the floor.    The worse thing about the bathroom was the lighting.  The absolute worse i've ever experienced.  I don't like looking like a zombie when i look in the mirror and I'm a guy.    I can't image what women must think....   The bed was a king bed, but it was two twins pushed together.  This wouldn't have bothered me except that they were not at the same height.     Also, there was only one usable plug by the bed.  Without a desk, i had to use the table to work and it was too small to have both my PC and dinner at the same time.   Finally, the way the heating and air conditioning worked was strange.  So if you have ready any of my reviews, you know that I'm always warm.  The windows are double windows so I could open the first set, but not the second.  So I had to get the air conditioning turned on.  The problem is that for me to have air conditioning, EVERYONE on the floor had to have air conditioning.  So i'm sure i caused some people to freeze.  By my last day there, the heat was on and I couldn't get air conditioning (because I'm sure people that wanted heat complained).   So while the location is GREAT and it's central and walking distance to most everything, the biggest issue i has was the inconsistency of housekeeping.   They didn't come at the same time ever, some days I'd have soap and new towels, while other days I'd have nothing.  Some days you could tell the vacuumed (or Hoovered) the carpet and other days, you could tell it was skipped all together.  The mildew in the shower door also bothered me.     So one they they took my wash cloth.so i used the spare in the closet.  They took that one as well and left me with none.  I called housekeeping to get a new one hoping it would come quickly so I could go downstairs for happy hour.   After letting the phone ring 28 times without an answer, I called the front desk.  It took over 48 minutes to get wash clothes and I missed happy hour.  I was very UNHAPPY!!!!As these inconsistency happened every day, by day 4 they had moved from a 4 to a 3, and then by the time i left, they were a 3 to a 2.  So, if you're looking to stay someplace just a couple of days, this is a great place to stay, but any longer, I'd recommend you go someplace else.  What was good: 1.  Location2.  Big Room3.  Overall Friendly staffWhat needs work:1. HOUSEKEEPING!!!!!!!2.  Room furnishings (needs dresser, Refrigerator, better bed)3. Room infrastructure (Lighting, especially bathroom, Heat/Air situation, more plug).4.  MILDEW in bathroom    YUCK!!!!",-1,17,0.478590669

We asked if there was anywhere else to have a drink and were shown to a small bland room just off reception and told we could have drinks brought in there.  Never mind there was a whole town outside the door.  The room we were allocated was quite small on the 5th floor but it was clean and tidy and the bed comfortable. There was no internet connection however as the hotel advertise, although we asked at least 4 times, nothing was done.  The towles were smelly and I had to ask the housekeeper for clean ones.   We decided to pay for breakfast, what a disappointment!  The staff were lax and really slow, and could not have cared less about the customer service.  There seemed to be no order to anything.

This leaves you gasping for fresh air and with a sense of foreboding as the room shrinks around you.From there move on to the fact that there was no hot shower in the morning - only cold water shot from the inviting showerhead.  Cold shower?  Really guys?Move on to breakfast, where the only options are cereal or MASSIVE FRIED BREAKFAST.  No poached eggs on toast?   Having opted for the MASSIVE FRIED BREAKFAST, I was asked if I wanted fried bread and I said no; yet there it was on my plate, right next to a ramekin of baked beans that were so sweet I wondered if they'd added powdered sugar.  The bacon was grey as if it has just seen a ghost, and was clearly aged.  Two slices of toast was a bit miserly, and the poor serving girl (clearly new) was watched like a hawk by her supervisor, a mere 3 feet away, as she poured my coffee.  An un-nerving experience.  I must say, however, that the black pudding was divine and the poached eggs beautifully done.Don't stay here.  It looks like a hotel, but it's nothing like one.",-1,4,0.60808658

441273552,"I usually like this hotel and was looking forward to staying here again buy unfortunately Room 116 is terrible (26/11/16).  The window has been obscured with some opaque plastic so you have no natural light.  This is because it faces into an alleyway.  No light means the room is so dark it is almost impossible to get ready in it.  The mirror is in the corner where the only light is from a lamp.  You canât use appliance near it because if you unplug the lamp you are plunged into darkness.  Itâs a good job my straighteners had a long lead because I had to do my hair in the bathroom.  The bathroom is equally dark, which is fine if there is light in the main room but there isn't.  I ended up doing my make-up in the corridor.  The ceiling above the shower looks like it is rotting and could fall in on you at any time.  The shower sprays all over the bathroom and the tap squirts water out the side.  When you get over all of this, you come back at night to realise the alleyway is the entrance to a rock club that plays really loud music into the early hours.  Luckily we got in at 2.30am or it would have been a nightmare.  In addition, Iâm not sure how well it had been cleaned because there was a broken hair clip on the floor.  Iâm also a bit confused about the hotelâs insistence that you pay a Â£50 deposit for incidentals.  There isnât even a mini bar in the room to raid.

I had booked through a third-party (booking.com) and the extra fee wasn't noted anywhere on any paperwork from them, nor noted anywhere obvious in the hotel itself. When I queried the extra fee, the member of staff on the reception desk was thoroughly unhelpful and stubborn. If the hotel had told me as I was checking in with the card or paying the final bill that there was an extra cost, I would have used a debit card. Instead, the member of staff refused to acknowledge that the hotel were at fault in any way.

187070704,"This hotel was a let-down, after the reviews we'd read on TripAdvisor. Our first impression on being greeted by the soft-focus photos of Chinese women on the apartment doors was of a seedy hotel or even a bordello. The furnishings and fittings were tacky and cheap. We had a Maxima apartment, with a spiral stairway to the upper floor. This creaked and cranked every time we set foot on it. The apartment felt claustrophobic because the only windows were skylights. On the upper floor we could also hear conversations from people in other apartments. The sofabed was not comfortable, providing no support in places.If that were the only problem, I wouldn't have bothered to rate this already poor experience, but three days after we checked out we we received a letter with a fuzzy black and white mobile phone photo showing a lampshade which had come away from the metal ribs. The hotel claimed we'd broken the lamp and had charged our credit card Â£60 (for a broken cheap lampshade?).We didn't break the lampshade, and there was no proof that we had done so. The photo could have come from any apartment or indeed anywhere, and the lampshade could have been broken by a cleaner for all we knew. Given the quality of the fittings, I wouldn't be surprised if it had just fallen apart, and they'd conveniently blamed it on us and used it as a pretext to charge our credit card an extortionate Â£60 for it. When I called to discuss this, they were most unhelpful. I managed to reverse the charge through my credit card company, but it made a not good experience in the first place a much worse one.We do not trust this company, and would never stay with them again.

Didn't get a refund for the unused room but got a good night's sleep instead :) A few other reviewers mention the stuffy, claustrophobic rooms - so if you generally sleep with the window open you should not stay here. Non-functional windows are a big defect and Roomzzz should be honest and upfront about the situation by including this information in the room descriptions. They're upfront about basement rooms - but fail to mention that you might as well be staying 3 floors underground no matter what. The host was very polite but could not offer a refund. They are very strict about cancellations so I was not surprised. Was a shame because the room was lovely and we were really looking forward to staying here. I am not normally picky!In anticipation of their response to my review, here's a summary of why they claimed the windows don't open and why their reasons don't hold water: 1. Health and Safety Concerns: Most hotel windows are fitted with spacers that prevent people from opening them fully - this is not a real issue and their 'windows' may even be considered a fire hazard. 2. It's a listed building: The windows needed to be replaced like for like. They look like sash windows and there is no reason for them not to function as sash windows. 3. Noise reduction: The walls were thin and the air conditioner was loud, so I'm not convinced by this one at all.",-1,6,0.519791667

67004184,"This so called apartment is a bit of a joke, previously described as a 4* hotel, I don't think so.When viewing the place on the internet it looks very classy, modern and spacious. We were expecting a place where we could chill out/relax/play music before going out-NO CHANCE. The actual place is located in a rough area of Manchester, having a dodgy pub opposite and very near to China town &amp; dirty cheap takeaways.Our room was ground floor and so every window looked out to the main street which was a busy road with pedestrians and traffic 24/7 all looking in. No privacy, the room vibrated when buses/trams go past and is noisy so little sleep.The room itself was decorated in a modern style, cheap looking, and basic. There was no cd player, the radio on the t.v. was useless for sound. The t.v. was not facing the bed either so you caould not watch any t.v. in bed if you wanted to.The strangest thing about it though was the fact that there was a large glass shower cubicle in the middle of the room, no separate bathroom. So we had to shower in the lounge /sleep area in front of the window? Very odd.The rug under the bed was filthy.The service we got was ok on arrival, but when calling the reception later for advice on the t.v. the girl was uninterested in helping us and did not seem to know anything.This is the Worst place to stay in Manchester.",-1,1,0.388482143

179670926,"My partner and i stayed her for one night after returning from holiday. On arrival the reception area looked quite nice was a little small and is located in the basement, there is a small lift to go down one floor. I had booked a suite room and requested a room with nice views, and a bath as well as shower. Our room was on the 5 floor, when we opened the door and entered the apartment we was extremally dissapointed, the air con is set to 18c so was very cold, the room had no personality was very plain was uninviting and uncosy was extremaly small as well, when you look at photos on the internet it looks much larger and there is a nice purple rug in the front room area which makes it appear cosy, this was not the case the room was plain. The white leather chairs where dirty, worn and ripped at the seams. Dont be fooled in staying on the top floor as there are NO views only sky lights its like staying in an attic room.we rang reception as we had just paid Â£135 with a late check out and a further Â£13.70 for parking, we wanted a refund and book else where, but this wasnt possible so we asked to see some other rooms, the receptionist showed us two diffrent rooms, these where no better very small plain and uninviting. We eventually settled on a liberty room which was priced as Â£115. still not worth the money, in the bathroom the mirror was dirty mascara marks, the shower wall had a hole in it where obviously a fixture has been removed, the skirting boards where all scuffed and marked, this can be fixed by painting it very simple. Now the bed! very small and low down, it creaked very loudly every time you got in and out or moved waking you up, the floors creak as well so we got no sleep. The apartment was so cold! aircon set at 18 and we turned it up to 30c and it NEVER heated up, the windows dont open so you can not get fresh air. the room has no pictures or mirrors its depressing. All in all this was a total waste of money and a let down. We hated staying here and wished we could of got our money back and stayed some where else, a premier inn is much cosy and you get a brilliant nights sleep.",-1,2,0.547148268

I have also had to endure an avalanche of unsoilicited marketing emails, despite my repeated attempts to unsubscribe from their mailing list.

We booked a Loft Suite for our wedding anniversary as it had photos of this lovely big suite with an upstairs bedroom, large bathroom with a bath and with a tv in the bath. SOLD, it wasn't cheap but it was worth it.So we turn up expecting a great weekend to be assigned to room 501, &quot;A Loft Suite&quot;. We get into the room and we first off notice that the bedroom is downstairs with a kitchen chucked up the top of one of the noisiest spiral staircases i have ever seen which didn't feel particularly secure. We then check the bathroom for this lovely bath with tv combination only to be greeted by a shower that was smaller and worse than the one we had previously had in their most basic studio suites previously.Of course we immediately head down to reception as we have paid a fair amount of money for something that wasn't in that room. The reception staff were a tad hit and miss depending on who you spoke to you got a different answer. We were told that apparently we had to specify that we wanted a bath? When the website has only photos of a bath and a review explicitly pointing out this luxurious bath. Nice deception work website... Good job.Eventually we are told we are stuck with this &quot;inferior&quot; room and that we could switch room the next night as there was a room free. Okay great we will at least get one night in &quot;Luxury&quot;. We then were told we had to leave our current room at 11am (standard check out time) but our new room would not be ready til 2pm as apparently all of a sudden the room we were getting had decided on late check out.So we spent the day out and about in the city and returned to be told of items were now in our new room 507. We got the key-card and went upstairs and the difference between the 2 rooms was unbelievable. Substantially bigger and came with both a shower and bath with tv in the bathroom, giant living room and bedroom upstairs via quieter and more secure spiral staircase. One main problem with this room however was that the roof blinds would not close as the controllers seemed to be unable to control them meaning be could not blackout of the apartment particularly for the morning. We returned after a night out also to find that appliances were continually cutting out (We later found out this was due to the new occupant of our previous room setting off the fire alarm!!). All of this twinned with the fact we could not use the Air Conditioning unit due to the unreal noise that is created made for an annoying warm night.Overall it is a nice apartment which is close to the city center however they really need to update their website descriptions as i felt completely misled and cheated out of one night of my stay(the most expensive of the 2 nights).",-1,3,0.507750219

When turning on the lights in the room, I realised that there was a male sock on the bed - not exactly what you expect from a hotel room! There was no apology and I was just reallocated another room.  The new room was dirty and looked like the furniture had been picked out of a skip in a bit of a miss match fashion.

The bathroom was just as bad with a stained sink basin, loose toilet seat, and a toilet that was nearly falling off of the wall. No iron or ironing board in the room, but they do offer a room down the hall where you can iron on a travel-sized board which is not very convenient for those of us who need proper business attire. Left the room at 11am only to find when I returned later that evening that it had not been cleaned all day. The staff did hang a new bath towel on my door, but for some reason didn't bother to clean the room. Is this a youth hostel?The price is reasonable for the UK, but you get less than what you pay for. Did not partake in the breakfast, but it did look adequate with a decent selection. Location good for exploring Manchester by foot, access to public transport/taxis, and a 15 minute walk to Piccadilly train station. Plenty of restaurants close by including Chinatown.

194973523,"First the good points, this hotel is located in a really central location in Manchester and the rooms can be relatively cheap. Thats about it.As you walk into the reception the hotel looks almost brand new or recently refurbished, which is really misleading. As you go upstairs to the rooms, the hallways are smelly and depressing - almost like a run down hostel.The rooms are really bad. Horrible stained carpet which is turning up around the edges, dark lighting, wooden veneer coming off from furnishings leaving chipboard underneath, stained desk, plug sockets falling off the walls. The smell of the room was absolutely horrible, sort of musky - there is no air ventilation if you have the windows shut.Furnishings are really horrible and the aesthetics of the room are just a bit annoying - no plug sockets in useful places, nowhere to sit infront of a mirror. The bathroom is like one of those prefabricated plastic cabins - no lock on the door and in this case, the door didnt even close properly. Toilet seat was stained. We stayed here for two nights but had two separate bookings, which we noted clearly to the receptionist when we first arrived. However after the first night the next morning the staff came up knocking on the door asking us if we were checking out, obviously the original member of staff hadn't listened or bothered to link our bookings. We also had the do not disturb sign on the door during the entire morning and housekeeping kept knocking dispite the sign - whats the point of that?And the last nail in the coffin - the first night we also came back to the hotel in the early hours about 2/3am, the doors are locked at this time so you need to use your keycard to get in. When we walked into the reception area the receptionist on duty appeared to have invited a whole bunch of his friends into the area for a sort of 'lock in', he was completely rude to us acting as if we were lying about staying there, then his friends proceeded to harass us as we walked through to the lifts.

Early check-in not honoured, no room upgrade, checkin staff frankly incredibly disinterested in their jobs.And then I discovered why, when on the last night of our stay I met the General Manager Rahul Parikh as he was stalking my black partner around the hotel making sure his room key - which had already worked the elevator - was valid for our room.I've never seen such appalling racism in the UK before. It took me thousands of pounds to accrue my status with Accor, and this hotel has single handedly shattered my confidence in the brand. This experience should never be subjected to anyone, and given it came from the highest ranked staff member in the hotel then it's obviously sanctioned from the top.We were so appalled that we requested to be moved to another hotel. The replacement duty manager JoÃ£o, whilst not fully briefed by Mr Parikh, was very helpful and sympathetic to our situation, reassuring us this isn't normal behaviour of the manager or the hotel, and offered us an upgrade to the Novotel next door. Given it was our last night  and the fact Mr Parikh had gone home, we decided to remain at the Ibis.I've since contacted the General Manager Mr Parikh, sending him a draft of this review, and his claim that he was attending to the security of the hotel (having tracked my partner around the hotel on security cameras, despite us already having been in residence for a day and a half) has plausible deniability to any claim of racism - right up to the point that he frogmarched my partner to our room and demanded that he swipe his room key to prove that he was staying there. Mr Parikh's claim that he was attempting to assist my partner to enter the room is completely at odds with how my partner describes what happened. Remember, my partner must have used a working room key to get into the elevator, so merely waving the room key would have been sufficient to prove he was a guest at the hotel. The fact that the General Manager frogmarched my partner down the corridor to our room and forced him to swipe the key to open the door is beyond any plausible claim of impartiality. I've stayed around hotel lobbies for hours, I've never been followed to my room, and I've definitely never been told to swipe my card to prove it's mine. But then again, I'm white.The hotel's not even a franchise - it's Accor-owned. The General Manager is therefore a direct employee of Accor, and the fact that he can behave in Accor's name in this way is a taint on Accor until it is addressed.Incidentally, as is usual when booking on Accor sites, Accor sought my feedback after my stay, so I submitted this review. Unlike every prior positive review I have submitted, I was not invited to also submit it to Tripadvisor. Think about that.Stay away from this hotel if you're black. That's the message we received from the actions of the General Manager. This is in the UK in 2017. Unbelievable.",-1,0,0.540462767

We were kept up all night by the door from the stair well banging against our adjacent wall, then the second night the lift broke twice meaning that we could hear the door warning at 3am and 8am. We were then moved next to another stairwell with a door which was not hung correctly so scraped along the floor. I have contacted their complaints department with no response at all, so went to their facebook page only to be resolved with a Â£30 voucher. Now I do not want to have to spend extra money at a hotel to restore my faith, I wish I hadn't spent money there in the first place!

When I got home I realised my mistake and immediately tried to contact the hotel.It took four days of trying to actually get somebody to answer their phone. I spoke to the housekeeping manager and explained the situation. They said that they would check if a cleaner had handed in the aftershave and would get back to me. They didn't get back to me.After three more days of trying to speak to them I finally got somebody to answer their phone who put me through to the housekeeping manager who very curtly told me nothing had been found.I sent a complaint to the hotel manager as well as IBIS central customer services. Days later I was told that they had checked and nothing had been handed in. Central customer services did thank me for my trust in them and they hope to welcome me back again soon!!!I responded to both to say that the bottle had been left in the middle of the desk so either a cleaner stole it or hadn't seen it (in the middle of the desk) so obviously wasn't cleaning properly.

Firstly, I went into the cafe area to purchase some snacks as there was not any food restaurants that was in close proximity. The packet of crisps i bought were stale and out of date by 5 days. Secondly, the room itself was clean and modern however the facilities were seriously lacking. There was no shampoo or toothpaste meaning i couldnt wash my hair or brush my teeth as i didnt bring these items as i was only coming for a night and expected a hotel to provide such essentials. Furthermore, I was provided with 3 hangers to hang my clothes, which for me wasnt much of an issue but for anyone staying longer than 2 nights this would be. Most importantly, despite the earlier comment of describing the room as clean, there was in fact a blood stain on the sheets which is completely unacceptable.The staff were also not very friendly or welcoming.

My bedroom was very much in need of a refurb, shabby and even though it wasn't particularly dirty, it didn't feel clean.  My room was at the front of the hotel - looking straight into the window of the chinese restaurant over the main road, so was noisy and I had to close the curtains to get any privacy.  I'm used to staying in Premier Inns for business travel and this was nowhere near that standard.  In the morning, the breakfast was very good with fresh bread, a good choice of cereals and hot food - much better than I was expecting.

When we got to our room we found we'd been placed in a double room despite booking a twin. We headed back down to reception who, again, very politely informed us that they were unable to honor our original booking but offered to place a camp bed in the room. I was very unhappy at this but unfortunately we didn't have time to request a refund and find another hotel as the gig was about to start. Upon returning from the gig a camp bed had indeed been placed in the room. Unfortunately, however, what slats weren't missing from underneath it were falling out. Not surprisingly this mean I had an absolutely terrible nights sleep and paid over a hundred pounds for the please.

The general facilities were adequate, and the breakfast area was generally reasonably clean and bright, with an unexceptional but adequate buffet provided.The rooms are small and barely furnished, as you might expect in an Ibis, but the reason for avoiding this hotel, and any with similar fittings, is the horrendous shower room which has been dropped in as a complete sealed unit in an attempt to save costs.It is flimsier than a portaloo, and ahas aged about as well as the sort of facility you might expect to find at Glastonbury.The prospect of using this cramped, dirty, smelly plastic module for more than one night is a particularly grim prospect, so book only as a last resort.",-1,0,0.555952381

The check-in lobby was nicely furnished however after exiting the lift on my floor it was clear that they had forgotten to upgrade the whole building.  The corridor was like walking through a hotel in the 80's, concrete, worn carpets, poor lighting.  Upong entering the room I found several issues, the bathroom door wouldn't shut, the tv turned itself off, the window wouldn't shut properly.Upon returning it was clear that someone had forgotten to insulate the rooms as the sound was horrific from the corridors, the street, the rooms next door.  Just terrible for the price paid. The saving grace of why this got 2 stars instead of one?

The carpets are not the cleanest.3.  The bedroom window didn't open.4.  The heating didn't work and the room was cold (still waiting on someone to fix it)5.  Staff don't seem to actually care about customers6.  Breakfast is not worth the money.  There is no fruit, there is only cheap cornflakes, granola, toast (using cheap bread which when toasted is like melba toast), yoghurt has been sitting out and is warm and the Danish buns are all greasy.  Id you want cooked you have to pay extra - which I decided wasn't worth trying.7.  Prices for dinner include offers, however on the two nights I was staying the staff tried to charge me full price and only I mentioned the meal deal did I get the discount.8.  I left a pair of straighteners behind and contacted the hotel - I am still awaiting a reply - they said they would contact me.9.  I was quoted Â£90 for one of my nights and I was charged Â£99 after the staff member starting at Â£112 which I contested.Positives:1. The beds are extremely comfortable.2.

413244274,"Major rebuilding / refurbishment works are currently ongoing at this hotel. Work takes place 7 days a week between 09:00 - 18:00.The noise levels are deafening during these times and parts of the hotel are a building site.Please avoid staying at this hotel if you need to use your room or the hotel (during working hours) until building works are complete - late October 2016.We chose to stay at the Manchester IBIS Portland Street for 5 nights over the August bank holiday weekend (25th - 30th August 2016) having previously stayed at this hotel last year and had such a good experience - a basic, budget hotel but in a fantastic location.Prices do seem to have gone up substantially this year and we paid premium rates - not quite the budget prices often associated with Manchester.Upon check in, we requested a âquiet roomâ and were told that as an Accor Club member, we had been upgraded to a âsuiteâ and our feedback was welcomed (so here it is!). Excited, we went to the room, only to discover it was just a recently refurbished (complete with paint stains on the new carpet), standard room. This hotel does not offer âsuitesâ - its a budget hotel and the rooms are standard budget rooms. We couldnât work out whether the receptionist was trying to be funny or ironic.A small notice taped to one of the lift mirrors announced that a major refurbishment programme is underway.Understatement! Major rebuilding works are currently ongoing. We stayed in room 310. The rooms directly below our room were being demolished and rebuilt. For the 6 days (5 nights) we were in the room we had constant hydraulic hammer drilling, hammering and crashing at a deafening volume reverberating throughout our room. At times, it felt like heavy machinery was about to crash through the floor / walls and it was impossible to hold a conversation, watch TV, listen to the radio, make phone calls or (God forbid) relax (we were on holiday after all) in the room as the noise was deafening. We have recorded examples, but are unable to attach them.At no point were we warned that rebuilding works would be taking place during our stay - either before arrival or during check in. Apparently, it's too difficult for IBIS to update their website or email guests..The building work / constant noise started at 09:00 and ended at 18:00 every day (including the weekend and the Bank Holiday Monday). It was relentless.We did raise our concerns with the receptionist, but her response was, âTough, the building work has to take place, thereâs nothing I can do about it, so just get on with itâ. She really didnât care. I did ask to speak with the manager (who wasnât available) and asked for the issue to be escalated - it wasnât.Had we known we would be staying on a building site and exposed to such extreme levels of noise beforehand, we definitely would not have chosen to stay here again - and we feel extremely angry that we were charged premium rates for this âprivilege!â.We also pre-paid for breakfast during our stay, however on two mornings there was NO orange juice (an absolute breakfast basic in most peoples opinion). Again, we raised this with the miserable receptionist, but were told, âTough, other drinks are available. We donât have to provide orange juice at breakfast time - just get on with it!âLuckily, there is a supermarket close by, so we ended up buying our own - which seems a little crazy!This hotel really needs to be closed whilst the refurbishment takes place as it is basically unusable during daylight hours and there were an awful lot of unhappy customers this weekend.Anyone planning on staying here needs industrial ear defenders - as the ear plugs they provide in the rooms just arenât sufficient to cope with the extreme daily noise levels.We never got a chance to speak with the manager during our stay - he was always âtoo busyâ or âin a meetingâ and unfortunately, the poor reception staff are not empowered to do anything other than check you in and clean tables.On a more positive note - all of the staff (apart from the one female receptionist with the severe attitude problem) were absolutely brilliant and a total credit to the hotel. I could feel their frustration as they were trying their hardest to cope with issues they had no control over. They should never have been put into this situation in the first place.It was unacceptable that no manager was available to discuss these issues with during one of the busiest weekends of the year.Please do not stay at this hotel until the building works are complete - when I am sure it will return to the fantastic hotel it used to be!Unfortunately the IBIS â15 minute guaranteeâ didn't apply to us as we didn't report our issues until 4 days into our stay (we really didn't expect the work to be ongoing during weekends and Bank Holidays - and gave them the benefit of doubt until we could stand no more.)If you are unfortunate enough to stay here whilst the building work is ongoing - make sure you complain as soon as you are affected.",-1,10,0.545261438

The overwhelming smell in my room was vomit that they had tried to disguise with bleach and air freshener.  The window had been left open too as an attempt to air the room but to no avail.  As I knew there were no other rooms in the city I didn't bother asking to be moved and went out for the evening, returning to the same smell.  Just to make sure I knew I was in the city centre the bottle bins from the neighbouring clubs were emptied at about 4am.  Room only Â£122.  Bargain.  So if you are planning a stag party stay here.

We looked at the photos of the property on the Maya Bric Hotel website and immediately booked four nights for our trip to Playa del Carmen in January 2013. Do yourself a favor and look at our photos, then compare them to the ones they have on their website.We arrived to the hotel and were greeted by a front desk agent (gentleman) who did not once bother to raise his head and acknowledge our presence. Rather, with his head down, he told us the rooms were not ready and to come back. When we returned from lunch our room was still not ready, even though we were an hour beyond the posted check-in time. They told us the person who was in charge of the booking.com account had gone out on a walk, so they couldnât help us. After waiting in a dirty lobby with trash and cigarette butts strewn about on the floor, we were finally given a room.

The hotel room was intended to ship her and the little guy there if needed which inevitably on day 2.5 was required but to our surprise they gave her room away and no longer had one to give to her at all, no compromises, no cash back nothing barely even a apology.

The hotel had no idea she had the option of staying with us and really did not seem to care.

When checking in, we asked the receptionist at the front desk of Maya Bric whether it would be possible to change our reservation because we were still unsure as to our itinerary.  She said that it was possible to pay by the day, since we didn't know if we would be staying in playa del carmen for the entire week. She never spoke of any financial ramifications due to the change in reservation.  She then allowed us to pay for our first night in pesos for the night.  We stayed at the Maya Bric Hotel for one night, and checked out the next day at noon since we found the hotel to be rather basic.However, the day after I returned home from my trip I received my credit bill and saw that the Maya Bric Hotel has charged me $341.37, for a whole week's stay.  In the hotel policy that I read online and in email from BOOKING.COM the hotel policy says:-Deposit-100% of the first night will be charged on the day of booking and is refundable -Cancellation policy if canceled up to 2 days before date of arrival, no fee will be charged.-Cancellation policy if canceled later or in case of no-show, the first night will be chargedSince my friend and I did stay for one night, I assumed the cancellation policy did not apply, and if it did, we had fulfilled it since we did indeed stay one night at the Maya Bric.After many calls to the Maya Bric, with little to no success, either having messages taken down, or not speaking to the manager at all, I enlisted the help of the people at BOOKING.COM (the site I used to book this hotel).  Well, they called multiple times to plead on my behalf, and the manager refused to reimburse me for my money.  The hotel manager stated that they have an INTERNAL cancellation policy that states they can charge the guest the full amount of their reservation, even though I was never informed of this when speaking directly with the receptionist regarding reservation changes.Long story short, this place was dishonest in their financial dealings, leaving little to no recourse for the customer.

The hotel is extremely noisy, I could have slept just as well in the bathroom of a night club.  Our room was shaking until 3:00 in the morning I we could still hear the music with ear plugs.  I must say that our room was on the thrid floor and that we could hear all the noises, music and screaming coming from the bars around.  I think the rooms at the lower levels were still noisy, but not as much.  The second unpleasant surprise was that the hotel owner actually rents the pool to a scuba diving school, which means that most of the day you are not allowed to use it.  Our kids where very diapointed with this.  The worst thing is certainly that the lady who was cleaning our room forgot to close the door after she came one day.  That night we came back late from a day trip to Chichen itza and found the door of our room wide open.  We where lucky that nothing was missing because everybody had free access to our room.  When I complained to the front desk I was told that things like that can happen.  Breakfast was not awful but they only have sweet things (cake, cookies, jam...and more and more cake).  After a week, I was a little fed up.  Also, breakfast is supposed to be served at 7h30 but they are often late.  I don't consider myself a very demanding guest, I have traveled around the world and stayed in all kind of low price places, but I was still disappointed with Maya Bric.  If you decide to go there, ask for a room in the NEW PART which seems better.  if you don't get a room there, I recommend you go somewhere else.",-1,1,0.524493786
4689355,"The reason this hotel did get one star is due to it's location (right on 5th Avenue), the fact that despite its location it is very quiet, the working air conditioners, the pretty interior gardens, and the pleasant staff. Unfortunately, these do not outweigh the negatives of an unpleasant one-night stay at the Maya-Bric. I should say that given the cost of the hotel, accounting for its location and the time of year (Christmas-New Years), I probably should not have expected much more than I got. But I am forever the optimist.I realize that, given the many positive reviews of the facility, there is a faithful cadre of people who will disagree with me, but, hey, it's my unvarnished TripAdvisor opinion. On to the complaints:(1) Let's start out with the most disconcerting thing about the hotel: toilet paper could not be flushed down the toilet, but had to be put in the handy garbage cans provided in the bathroom - uh, I don't think so. I never ascertained the reason for this, maybe it was a post hurricane thing and is now corrected. I would definitely make sure that you can flush before you go. (2) &quot;It's a bathroom.&quot; &quot;It's a shower.&quot; It's a bathroom.&quot; &quot;It's a shower.&quot; &quot;Wait, it's a bathroom and a shower!&quot; The bathrooms were more reminiscent of what you see in an RV, with no line of demarcation, other than a shower curtain, between the shower head and the toilet.(3) Does anyone in Mexico believe in providing sufficient light in a hotel room to read?(4) I'm sure that some day, when I'm dead and on a marble slab, I'll be laid out on a harder surface, but for now, these beds just moved into first place.Part of the problem here is that one does not go to the Riviera Maya to move this far down the hotel food chain. I have been visiting the Yucatan at least once a year for the past nine years and the changesbeing wrought in a place like Playa are amazing (and sometimes disappointing), but, the city has moved well beyond backwater status. Its hotels should reflect that change, and this one most certainly doesnot.",-1,4,0.54680842

Perfunctory spa treatments ( except excellent Swedish Massage), average meals with no wine or ambience, a clearly dysfunctional staff (found complaining in the hallways), and loud and obnoxious guests were my experience at Ste. Anne's.And the price - what a shock! I could have gone to Mexico for a week for what I spent - and no doubt should have.

The services were horribly minimal and very pricey except the massage I had which was great by Jen. Definitely did not come back feeling revived but just the opposite more exhausted. This experience was a learning curve, the food was absolutely tasteless and not what I would call fine dining or fresh.

101290389,"My boyfriend and I, both in our mid-thirties, visited Ste. Anne's after seeing it had a special overnight package. Some of our friends had visited in the past so we were excited to check it out. I have to say, while there was nothing particularly wrong with the place, to me it felt a little dowdy and not particularly relaxing. I guess I just expected more from such an expensive spa that's supposed to be one of the best in Canada. The food was pretty good, the staff was generally good, but not exceptional, and my massage was great. That being said, my general feeling about the spa is that the hotel is a little dated. While I understand that they're going for a &quot;period feel&quot;, it still felt a little run-down. When we checked in the reception area felt incredibly hectic and not welcoming or relaxing at all. The reception area was filled with people checking in, checking out, staff lounging around, bags laying everywhere and no one seemed to know who was in line, who we should talk to, who could help us. It was a terrible first impression. We stood amidst the chaos for about 10 minutes before anyone asked if they could help us. We had a similar experience at dinner one night. While the food was great, that night we waited about 15 minutes for a server to come see us after we were seated. I don't think Ste. Anne's is a bad place. It's just maybe a little more geared to an older audience (while we were there the vast majority of guests were retired women in their 60s). For me, if Ste. Anne's wants to be considered one of Canada's best, it needs to really step up all of its service and facilities from &quot;just ok&quot; to absolutely exceptional.",-1,0,0.59537415
547872182,"Just come back from the âAll Inclusive Overnight Gateway for 1 night from Ste Anne Spa Resort. This was my first visit and I set my expectation high due to the fact that they targeted themselves as high end, relaxing atmosphere, providing mental wellbeing settings and also take pride in their exceptional services, attention to details and stars establishment. So I was looking forward for the trip. Getting there was easy. Clear direction and road sign leading to the resort. SPA SERVICE: I think is good, however, I noticed that there were 80% chance that you will be serviced by the opposite gender spa therapists. I found it interesting as I waited in the spa waiting room for a while. Every time a therapist came in, he or she will yell out a âNAMEâ to the room and the TYPE of service that you have requested. By the way, I wondered why they posted a big âQuiet Waiting Areaâ/âShhhhâ sign there. Anyways, again 80 % chances you will be serviced by the opposite sex therapists. I do not think Ste Anne ever ask for your preference when came to your personal choice of choosing a male or female therapist. They keep emphasized on employment equity in their web site; however, I believed they misunderstood the concept of employment equity verse putting your customers first.  I noticed that some ladies did shock and hesitate when a male therapist shown up and lead them to the âFull Body Massageâ session.  There was no privacy in this system. The entire room recognized your name and what treatment that you were going for.  I was surprise that the management never realized this point. The overall âatmosphereâ lacked spa feeling, as the spa and rest area was right within the day-to-day business of like running a Doctor office. Boutique offered many items for tryout which we purchased two beauty products back.I just want to bring up the two concerns on the facilities.  One of the shower heads in the changing room is all clogged. I wonder how people can shower with only 4 lines of water (see photo) and facility staff never noticed from all these times. During the winter months, people entering steam room, running back from the outdoor pools leaving the floor soaking wet in that high traffic area. People walked by to the spa waiting room may slip and injured on this constantly wet floor especially the elders. Why they never thought of installing heated floor and better ventilation to keep the floor dry up faster in addressing the issue. Dinning service was fast and prompt. The waiter seemed inexperience in which she was reading her 2 pages of recommended food notes: line by line + words by words without looking at us the whole time. It was kind of award moment for all of us. The food was average â nothing spectacular.  Prime rib was overcooked even asked for medium. Deserts in general were not impressed and needed to be improved. I never realized a CrÃ¨me Brulee could be made like this. The inside pudding was light brown not creamy. Please remember to use only the yolks, not the whole egg next time. The granulated sugar topping was eye opener. It was 4-5x times thicker than the conventional paper thin layer. I hardly cracked it open. (see photo)When we checked out, the front desk lady handed over the bill for the final balance. I saw there was a charge for the wellness class so I just mentioned to her that our overnight package did include one complimentary wellness class for each person. She seemed startled to hear that and give me the look that I just made it up on the spot. She immediately asked Richard at the front desk. They both glanced at me and seemed no clue on what I was talking about. Richard reacted as not believing my words and replied back that he needed to check on the computer as well. I was shocked and terrified that the well-established Ste Anne simply has no idea of what they were doing internally. I asked myself from all these years perhaps we were the only persons took the wellness class with the package? Well, someone was occupied the computer at that time and people were queued up for check out. so Richard had no choice but told us âOkay, we throw in for free thenâ. It was brzarre that that was something we were paid and entitled for and ended up we were treated as we got begging it for free! Why treated and failed your customer at the end of the relaxing spa trip meanwhile taking pride in promoting yourself as exceptional customer services provider and attention to details quality.In summary, I am not sure what happen in Ste Anne. I would conclude that our night away was a disappointment. At first, for what you're paying, you should feel nothing should go wrong and everything should be taken care of. Front-line customers facing staff should well aware of the various different packages of what they are offering. Know your stuff first before try to sell anything to the public.  I think Ste. Anne's is relying on their past well known reputation as âcash cowâ in being the ultimate in luxury spa and forgetting to pay attention to every little detail.",-1,4,0.494694042
273121177,"I visited St.Anne's for the first time and thought it was lovely. The bucolic gardens and faux old-time-y buildings made me feel like I'd just walked into an episode of Outlander, and my shiatsu treatment left me more relaxed after any massage I've ever had. The food wasn't big-city gourmet, but was tasty enough. The decor is very A-Place-My-Mom-Would Like (flower-y, overstuffed couches etc.), so if you're looking for a super chic, uber-modern spa getaway this isn't the place for you, but if you're looking for a place where people drink high tea in fluffy white robes, than it definitely is!",-1,1,0.408181818

And, there is no liquor licence.  I mean no wine, beer or cocktails.  Now that was some shock.If it rains, there is nothing to do.  There is no TV in your room and unless you spend more money on more spa services, you can basically stare at the walls until the rain stops.I'd suggest getting a nice hotel room and book yourself an in-room massage instead.  It will cost you less and the ambiance will be much, much nicer.It still shocks me that so many people gave St. Anne's 5 stars.  Giving it only one star was truly way too much!",-1,7,0.572135417

We had enjoyed our first visit a year earlier, so returned, but this time we both broke out with very itchy skin rashes on various parts of our bodies. It wasn't allergies because we had different treatments. We inquired if we could have picked it up from the hot tub, and they said no that the hot tub is checked regularly. The rash continued for about two weeks after we returned home, very itchy and irritating. The only thing that helped was cortisone cream. Finally, it was determined that we must have picked up poison ivy there, as it fit the description and treatment, and we were told by St. Anne's that one of the staff had poison ivy at the same time we were there. The rash and itch on my arm still returns to bother me from time to time. The most disappointing part was the inapproachability of admin and  our inquiries being put off or ignored.

They stated if they were able to rent out the rooms, there wouldn't be any charge. If they were not able to rent out the rooms, they would contact us first before charging our card - not to worry. It was also stated that they would send us a gift card if we were charged. Well, the weekend came and went without any activity on the card or anyone contacting us. While returning home, out of state, the charge came through without any notice. This pretty much had us stranded about 150 miles away from home.

Parking was horrible and expensive. The bed was falling apart and made noise if you got close to it (how romantic).  The manager whined about the way we parked, I didn't know I needed to bring my ruler to check how far I was from the wall and the flower pots.  Our phone chargers mysteriously disappeared.  There wasn't even any drinking water available.  We asked on our last day if we could leave our car there for 20 minutes while we finished our meal and the manager refused. My husband had to leave the restaurant and go get the car. We paid $35 a DAY to park.  I have never been as disappointed with my accomadations as I was with my stay at the Cornstalk Hotel.

408872722,I am from the New Orleans area but moved out several years ago. Now I come to the city to visit like any other tourist and like to stay in the French Quarter. I have always heard about the Cornstalk Hotel and passed its majestic looking facade on the street. In reality the hotel was a very big disappointment. It is very run down with little maintenance showing. It was evident by the upstairs balcony that was closed due to extensive repair from years of water damage. The carpet in the room was very discolored and dirty looking. We stayed in room 210 and the 4 poster bed frame was actually tilting in towards the bed on both ends. We expected to see antique furniture in the hotel but the paintings were not cared for and warped to the point the canvas had ripples in it. The chandelier in our room had not been dusted and dust webs could be seen from it. The paint on the old door frames and throughout is shoddy and looks like they used water based paint. Does all this really matter? I think it just goes to show that this property is NOT being well cared for. The wall paper is in OK condition but in many places you can see it bubbling or with ripples in it. The bathroom was run down but looked to have been remodeled years ago but not restored to anything resembling the historic period. Resembles a motel 6 or similar hotel bathroom.I can only say that it has the best location for getting around the quarter but there are much better hotels in the area that have been upgraded for the price and location. I was terribly disappointed with all the hype I had heard over the years. I will not stay again and not likely to recommend this property.We traveled with another person and his room was larger on the first floor but was in similar shape although his bed was in better condition his bathroom was actually in a closet with absolutely no room.,-1,1,0.388305275

277119751,"I've been so upset, it's taken me a week to calm down about our horrible experience to be able to write a review. I'll start out by saying I've traveled all over the world for over 20 years, on a budget and always through a 3rd party. This is the worst hotel I've ever been in. Ever. Worse than any of the hostels in Europe. In fact, even the worst hostel I stayed in was luxury compared to Andrew Jackson Hotel. I wanted our sister trip to be amazing. I read the reviews and hoped for the best. Since parking with the hotel was so expensive, we parked in a parking garage for much cheaper a few blocks away. This hotel was very easy to find and quiet. The guy at the front desk was nice and check in was easy. I'd read that others had problems since they booked through a 3rd party but even though we'd booked through a 3rd party, checkin was easy. Our room was 210, upstairs in the corner of the courtyard. The court yard is run down but pleasant. that was the last of the pleasantries. Room was dingy, corners &amp; edges of room on carpet were dirty with crumbs &amp; other muck. Bathroom was ok but old and mildew in places which makes it look dirty. Bed is concave. Yes, it's visibly sloping. There was also at least half an inch around the bottom and side of the door to the outside. Who knows how many bugs and rodents are constantly in that room. It was so dirty, my sister &amp; I hung our bags in the closet because we didn't want any rodents getting in them while we were out on the town. We left and had a great time in NOLA. When we got back around 9:30pm, I sat on the bed and not only was it wet but the vent was dripping. I understand it's condensation but still, who wants to sleep in a wet bed? I went down to the front desk and he gave me a key to a middle room on the first floor of the courtyard. I went in to quickly check it and it seemed fine although there seemed to be a large crack around the door of every room. We moved our things down and returned the other key to the first room. Sister took a shower first. No soap, anywhere. Annoyed. She grabbed a towel and it was dirty with a poop stain. Yes, you read that correctly. It was refolded and hung. Although we were grossed out, we chose to laugh about it. The other towel was fine. When we went to pull the sheets back together, there were crumbs and dirt all over. Seriously? Did the maid think no one would notice? I went up the front desk again and was almost in tears. It's unacceptable anywhere, in any circumstance for all of this to happen. No apology. Offered to give us the key to go back up to the first room. REALLY? No. I asked for clean sheets so we could put them on ourselves. He said the maid was gone and he didn't have the key to the linen closet. I asked what we were to do. He said that since I booked through a 3rd party, I got a great deal and couldn't refund my money. I said this was unacceptable, that I didn't care how much I pay, a hotel should be clean and safe. He offered to check with their sister hotel St Pierre. I said, sure but to make sure it was clean. He said he'd set it up, for us to go pack up and meet him back up at the front desk with our things. When we got back up there, it was 10:45 PM. We fully expected him to call us a cab. Instead we got directions to walk. I was so mad I started to cry as soon as we turned to leave. I'll just say although St Pierre was a step up, I wouldn't recommend it to most either. It's the worst experience I've ever had traveling but I'm glad I was with my amazing sister to help me try to laugh about it and not ruin our whole trip.",-1,6,0.501729025
276298230,"Prior to booking, I read A LOT of the reviews and although many were negative, I chose to focus on the positives and hope for the best--after all, we love historical charm. I looked forward to getting one of the lovely little rooms pictured on their site. I was expecting quaint and quirky...what I got was a dorm room. When I turned the key and opened the door to Rm 106, it hit something and would only open maybe a foot or so. I was surprised to see that it was hitting the bed nearest the door (*see photo). It wasn't possible to pull the suitcases in--I had to turn them on their sides and monoeuvre to get through the door. Once in, the tiny room was the first thing I noticed--no big deal, right?  Went to put water and leftovers in the fridge (a fridge was promised on the site) only to find that behind the cabinet door there was none. We put one suitcase on the fold out and the other on the floor--the room became even smaller. Then in the bathroom it was obvious that this was no ordinary room--it was meant for college freshman. No place at all for cosmetics on/near the sink and the toilet paper roll sat on the toilet back as the holder was broken. And if one wanted to, it would be possible to use the toilet, soak your feet in the tub and wash your hands...all at the same time (*see photo). Worse than that (*see photos) there were gaps all around the door which also compromised the lock...safety is paramount to me plus I didn't know what could crawl under or around the door--I would be forced to stuff towels and wedge a pillow to block these gaps. Now I was miffed! I went to Reception only to be told that there were no other rooms--they were full--and by the way, there was not a fridge in every room. She offered to book us into another room the next day if one came available. What choice did we have? In the back of mind I kept thinking: this is costing $306 USD for 2 nights and I had booked many months before. Really??!! A positive was the sweet lady who brought the Continental Breakfast to our room--croissants and great coffee. Went to see the gentleman at the front desk--he apologized for any inconvenience and told me that we could have Rm 101 (just off the lobby). We looked in. It was HUGE with plenty of space--had a much larger bathrm--a fridge--big screen TV at one end of the room positioned so BOTH beds could see it--and had a street view (noisy at night though--but I have earplugs)--and the door closed tight. The maid told us to put our suitcases in the closet and she would have the rm cleaned in time for when returned after our tour. At 3 we returned--and watched a man enter &quot;our&quot; room after checking in. I told him it was ours and he showed me his key for Rm 101. The man at Reception again gave apologies and agreed that it was our room. Imagine if we had come back later!!!!!!!! . Now, for the piece de rÃ©sistance &gt;&gt;&gt; I called 45 min prior to when we wanted to leave on May 9th (as instructed by staff) for the valet to bring our car. Over 1 hr later...still no car. 15 min after that...still no car. The young lady at Reception got a call and told us the valet could not find our car! Seriously?!! Another 20 min went by. She called them to suggest that maybe it had been driven to another property. The valet showed up shortly after (it was almost 2 hrs after my initial call). He apologized profusely. It had been at the other property. I was furious--we were now delayed in getting to an important event. I asserted that I would NOT be paying any parking charge whatsoever. I was told it would be removed from my bill--and it was. So...if you're still awake after reading this, BE SURE that you do not get Rm 106 and perhaps other rooms on the ground floor?  For the price they charge, this is not acceptable at all!!!",-1,24,0.455906643

(Yes, I watched Ratatouille, but trust me, doesn't make any difference when you are in that situation).With the mouse still in our room, I went downstairs and told the guy at the desk what just happened. He didn't look too surprised actually. He didn't apologize but offered me to move us to another room.I accepted, but while we were moving our things to the second room we saw another mouse.

When she presented me with the card receipt to sign, I asked her if I hadn't already signed one when I checked in. She said yes but this was the real charge. She then informed me the first money debited from my account was being &quot;held&quot; or &quot;frozen&quot; then told me I could call my bank with my receipt information to have them release the first charge from the hotel so I could have the money back in my account. I asked her to clarify why they were double charging me, and she said they were not. However, I had already signed two debit card receipts at this point and had her tell me I would have to call my bank. I didn't understand how this could not be double charging, so I asked for her to explain again. She attempted twice, and the first explanation sounded as if the money from my account was just being held and when this authorization went through, it would be released to them. Upon further questioning, the woman said it was being held by the bank but this charge would be taken also and I would have to still get my first amount of money back somehow. It was during this I was told that I had incurred a $30 charge for using a debit card the first time.  The second receipt did not include this charge, and I was not told if it was still going to be taken from the account or anything. I finally just took my receipt and left in utter confusion. I still do not understand any of their logic as it seems to change every moment. The room was expensive enough with all of its problems then to have to deal with this issue was ridiculous. Please see below for a list of room problems. I was also charged $1.50 for long distance telephone charges when checking out. The phone number was a toll free 800 number. The hotel also employs false advertising. On their website, the hotel is shown in the pictures as white. The hotel is actually yellow. There were no hair dryers in the room, I do not know if you had to ask for one or not. There is also a promise of &quot;Lush and Beautiful Gas-Lit French Quarter Courtyard with Exquisite Fountains.&quot; There was one fountain, and no evidence of gas lights anywhere. Parking was also an issue. I was told there was limited self parking at their sister hotel, the St. Pierre at 911 Burgundy Street. When I asked where to park, I was told that the St. Pierre's lot was full and I would have to go elsewhere.Room Problems:Fire sprinkler on western wall was painted over.Electrical outlet on western wall do not work.Mirror on northern wall was not firmly attached to wall and wobbled at slightest disturbance.The top socket in the electrical outlet could not keep anything plugged in due to its looseness.One of the beds' sheets had unidentifiable dark spots.One bed was missing a middle knob.Desk was missing knobs.Old nails were left sticking out of the walls and just painted over.The neck and switch for the lamp on the nightstand were not in tightly and turned when you tried to switch the lamp on.The closet door stuck when trying to open or close it.The closet had an odd odor.The bathroom door stuck when trying to open or close it, and it could not be opened all of the way due to the bed placement.Cabinets under the sink in the bathroom had warped doors that did not meet all the way down the middle.No thermostat in room, but the thermostat in 107 seemed to control the temperature for both rooms.The ceiling fan shook as it ran.

I never expected the dirty, filthy, disgustingly rank room that was given to us.     I booked 3 months in advance for a room with a double bed, and upon arrival, we were given a room with 2 twin beds, with room for nothing else.I went to the front desk to complain, and she told me nothing else was available. I demanded to know who gave our reserved room away and like magic she found us another room. Finally, I thought we were getting somewhere, until we opened that room and the smell was so bad I got dry heeves.NO KIDDING.The room looked so filthy I did not want to even sit on the bed.     Now it is time to park. When I made reservations I was told that they had parking. When we asked where to park, we were told lot was full and we were directed to go to a public parking area about 6 blocks away.Ok so we did. She neglected to tell us that the parking was $4 an hour , and we had a 2 day booking so you do the math on about a 48 hour stay.     That was the last straw, we drove back and told the clerk everything was horrible and we were leaving. We were charged for 1 night stay at a rate that was probably the highest they charge.

There was no order form as stated in the room, we asked at the front desk and were given the form which we completed and requested breakfast for the next morning for 7:30; at 8 a.m. it had not arrived so we called the desk and was told they were late it would be there 10 - 15 minutes, it arrived 30 min. late.  We could not take coffee in the courtyard as it was rainingâ¦so we had to have it in our room unfortunately there was not place to set it other than the bed as the dresser was used by the TV and the night stands were occupied by a lamp and clock on one side and the ice bucket and plastic cups on the other.  There was an electrical outlet which did not work and appeared to be providing power to the smoke alarm, not sure if it would have worked if needed.  There other outlet near the bed was used by the lamp and clock.  The only remaining outlet in the room (excluding bath) had one available but your chargers etc would not stay plugged in.  So we had to unplug the tv and rotate our chargers for our phones, iPads etc.  The staff was friendly, but don't ask for anything because that is where it stops.  We came back one day from being in the rain to dry off there was one towel in the room.  When we went back out we stopped by the front desk and told him, he advised us it would be taken care ofâ¦several hours later when we returned there was no additional towel.  We have traveled through the U.S and Europe and always prefer to stay in small historical locations when possible.  We don't mind a small room as long as the amenities are clean and comfortable.  What we found here was dingy and old like no one cared.  Since our booking and stay I have seen responses from Management where they have indicated that they are making renovations.  They might be better off to put it someplace on their site.  Trust me, (and this is not a practice of mine) if I could have found a room anywhere else this past weekend I would have cancelled and gone elsewhere.  For what we got I think we over paid.

310945571,"Our room just had a bathroom remodel and we were the first to use it. Apparently no one inspected the job. Shower curtain was installed so high it hung 3 inches above the tub, tub was so cheap it flexed and creaked, there was no toilet paper rack and there was grout everywhere. The cheap plastic toilet seat wasn't tightened down and moved when you sat down. There was no threshold plate between the bathroom and the bedroom, leaving  a recess, raw old wood and holes visible. Be careful not to trip.  The maid never cleaned the bathroom during our 5 day stay, the grout and dirt was never touched. The grout on the top of the tub and the faucet remained there the entire time. Apparently she only made the beds and dropped off new towels. You have no control over the room temperature, apparently it's controlled centrally. So the room temperature was all over the place, cold in the morning and hot in the evening. We relied on the ceiling fan for comfort. The highlight was Annie delivering our morning coffee and croissant. She was bright and pleasant every morning.

Then tried to lock the window/door to the balcony to leave and it didn't work.  I called the front desk and they knew about it and didn't tell me.  When I asked them to fix it or move me to another room, they said i could change rooms for another $75/nite.  They did call for maintenance and when he showed up he just nailed the window shut so I had no access to the balcony at all.  I complained again and then they finally offered the other balcony room to me but wasn't allowed to see it until i agreed to take the room for the stay.  I refused that and when I said I was checking out they still charged me for half a nite stay and half of day parking rate.  And through all of this, they couldn't make any decisions on site themselves.  Every conversation had to be followed with them calling management at another hotel to get anything settled.  It was a horrible experience and I would NOT recommend anyone to this hotel.  To think they knew the room was accessible from the outside and didn't notify me when I checked in and then wanted to charge me upgrade to the only other king balcony they had is unbelievable to me!!!!

The bridge and groom were staying nextdoor at the Cornstalk Hotel (BEAUTIFUL!!) so I wanted to be as close as possible but at a cheaper price. My family and I booked 5 rooms at this 22 room hotel. The rooms all seemed dirty but doable.... except my room.1. ROACHES... yes, my room had a giant 2&quot; roach in it (not even exaggerating about the size). My boyfriend told the guy at the front desk, who said there were no other rooms available and that there was nothing he could do. He did not even apologize or offer any accomodations. He said &quot;if you see it again, let me know and I will kill him.&quot; Sure enough, at about 1am, we saw it again. The front desk clerk came up to the room, stepped on the giant roach with his shoe, picked it up with a paper towel. He then LAUGHED and said &quot;there you go! hahaha!&quot; To which I replied in a VERY pissed off tone, &quot;It is not funny.&quot; He then left the room. No sorry, nothing. Oh and he left part of the roaches leg and some guts... that we had to clean up ourselves.2. NONE of the 5 rooms we booked had clocks. None.3. Our sink did not drain. We had to shove the plastic &quot;no smoking&quot; sign in the dran to keep it open and flowing.4. The shower dripped...all... night... long. 5. There was a hole in our floor that was covered by the carpet. Glad I didn't sprain my ankle wearing heels in that awful room.5. Of the 4 or 5 front desk clerks we saw during our stay, only ONE of them greeted guests as they came in went. The others ignored us. We were even standing next to the front desk talking amongst overselves about the best way to get to the airport and the front desk clerk (Toby, I think it was) never chimed in. He seemed irritated when we asked him.6. Stained carpets, stained sheets. Now, I know that bad reviews should be taken with a grain of salt because people tend to ONLY write reviews when they are bad. However, I am not a high class girl. I work with a budget. I did not except this place to be the cream of the crop (like the Cornstalk nextdoor). However, I do not like sleeping with 2&quot; roaches and I would like a clock... AND AN APOLOGY!They did not accomodate us. That was the WORST way to spend nearly $300 and three nights. The only thing good about this hotel is the location.",-1,5,0.635218312
247585920,"I was very disappointed of my recent trip to the hotel. We spent 3 nights there over new years, and somehow the room went from $195 dollars a night to roughly $290 for the last two nights. It was already not worth the first rate, but definitely not worth the second one.I will start with the pros:- The location is amazingThat's itNow for the cons:- I understand it's in the French quarter and it's an old hotel, so I won't be judging on this, but the room was ugly. For that price, I expect nice carpet, walls and curtains. We had to hang our towels over the cheap blinds as the outside light was hitting our eyes.- Our room was right by the ice machine. Do you know what's noisy? Ice falling at 4am.- Cobblestone: Very pretty, very loud when luggage is being rolled on it. (However, I must admit we couldn't hear any street noise so it was quiet on that standpoint).- Cleanliness: on the last day, I asked my husband if he had clipped his nail during the trip because there was a huge nail clip in the bathroom; he hadn't. The towels had black marks on them, and somebody else's hair.- Freezing: There was no thermostat in the room, but it was freezing. I asked for an additional blanket and I should have been more clear since what I got is the tiny &quot;presentation&quot; blanket they put at your foot, when I wanted an additional duvet. My fault.- The breakfast was decent: a drink and a croissant per person. The first morning it was on time, the second it was on time but we didn't have any butter, the third, when we had to catch a plane, it was more than 45 minutes late, and we were told &quot;they had other customers but us&quot;.- Amenities: No shower cap, or pen, or notepad in the room. Only two bath towels and two hand towels (no towel for my hair).- Valet: their parking is located 3 miles away from the French quarter, so we had to give an hour notice before getting the car. On the first night our car stayed in the streets on a no parking zone for more than an hour before they took it to the parking.All in all, we were very disappointed, the staff wasn't really rude but not helpful either, our room was dirty (found two bobby pins, so i'm guessing it hadn't seen a vacuum in a while). ugly and cold. I was staying with someone else and their room was much bigger and prettier so we might have just been unlucky.",-1,9,0.472561328
245656555,"We are driving  home now and are cursing ourselves for having  chosen this unkempt, neglected  hotel. If we'd known  how shabby this place was, we'd have spent 50 bucks more for the Cornstalk Hotel next door. First day there, there was a LOT of slamming  of doors that rattled our walls. We were in the room at the top of the stairs. The windows have visible gaps letting air and moisture in. Understand, I'm an Interior Designer and WANTED ambiance and charm. But I did NOT WANT moist air and the smell of someone else's marijuana smoke wafting into our room! The shower leaks badly at the floor because the curtain is too high, and visible rot and mildew is seen at the lower, left portion of the stall. The wee fiberglass shower was so small, I could not bend down to shave my legs. Staring at that rotten moulding made me feel as though the entire shower might fall through  the floor. There was only ONE small towel rack, but plenty of room for hooks or racks to the left of the small sink.As for the toilet, the tiny space left little room for proper seating, and the cheap, plastic seat continually  slid over to the left with a loud snap. The carpet? Dark blue nastiness. Walking on it barefoot is a very poor idea. My feet were, LITERALLY,  black from it. I was shocked  when I went to put my socks on. I'm sorry, but NO hotel floor should  be so foul. I doubt these carpets have been cleaned in years. The Continental Breakfast was a disgrace! The first  morning...no where to eat but on bed. The brochure promised fruit for croissants,  juice, coffee, tea. We got ONE tiny croissant, one tiny jar of jelly, one knife, COLD coffee...not exaggerating. .cold. no heat, luke warm water for a tea bag and NO SPOON to stir anything.  No napkins. Since our bath toilet paper holder was loose and the roll had fallen and rolled into the sopping wet floor, we had to use our towels as napkins, and my toothbrush  handle to stir. The second day, we actual got the butter they promised, but no orange juice that we requested, that was offered. The breakfast if a JOKE, and the inconsistencies were glaring. Lastly, upon entering the hotel on day two, we found that an enormous  pile of someone's  luggage was blocking the stairs. We had to climb over that stack to get to the third step...Could not reach  the bottom  step. I asked the desk clerk who left that there, and she said that SHE had. Why on Earth was that  the spot she chose, knowing that guests like us need those stairs??? Had a fire been burning, what a disaster. We're  young enough  to have made the luggage  climb, but you get some elderly guest? That person would have been stuck. Incredibly, the clerk STILL had not removed the obstacles in 20 minutes time when we had to go back down!! This is completely unacceptable!  The hotel is shabby, dirty, rotting, and hires staff who areunapologetic about blocking the stairs to the room. After that, we didn't  even bother to complain about the incomplete, lame &quot;breakfast&quot;. And then, when the housekeeper gave us new towels, she debated with me whether we were going to stay that second night. I had to explain  that we were paid up for two nights, but I still do think she believed  me! The SOLE positive attribute that this hotel possesses is its location in the Quarter. But we paid dearly for that as we had to park five blocks away at 27 bucks a day, then walk back to our room, and not even be able to safely travel up the stairs. My advice  would be to avoid this hotel. I do not think that a single employee  here gave a rat's buttocks about guest satisfaction.  Spend your money at a cleaner, more well maintained hotel! In my line of work, I've restored dozens of centuries old homes. If this place is maintained for much longer in the fashion that it currently  is, it's going to be rubble in a few years anyway.",-1,12,0.372191327

We thought walking barefoot in the room was a good idea, but when we discovered black soot pouring from under our feet during showers, we realized that the carpet was the source of our dirty feet.  Even the act of walking the very short distance from the shower to the bed left the soles of our feet black.  Clean carpet for such a small room should not be too hard to achieve.The in-progress bathroom remodel looked and felt horrible.  The lack of a vent in the ceiling caused the bathroom to be inordinately cold during what should have been a hot bath/shower.Lack of available hot water was also a huge disappointment.  After a long day of walking around the Quarter, one looks forward to a hot bath or shower.  This was impossible with the lukewarm water that came from the bathtub faucet.  The water pressure was also very low.  The moulding in the bathroom was not finished either.  The grout of what looks like new tile had never been cleaned, and the door was never painted.  If the bathroom was not ready for guests, why did you rent the room?Two of the electrical outlets were non-functional.  These were the two that were on the wall that face the door to the room.  The smoke detector was attached to one of these non-functioning outlets.  Does this also mean that the smoke detector was also out of commission?The strikeplate on the door was mangled, as if someone had tried to break into the room at some point.  The look of this leaves one with a feeling of insecurity.  Even if the door locked properly, the look of this is unacceptable and so easy to fix.  The television was non-functional for nearly two hours after we checked into the room.  Two people had to visit the room to be able to disconnect a malfunctioning digital box and create any sort of TV connection. The man who finally fixed the problem said that this had been the third box that had given him problems.  If you know that this is an ongoing issue, why not fix them all before a guest finds your problem for you?  I realize that parking is scarce in the Quarter, but how does one get in/out privileges if it takes you 45 minutes to get our vehicle?  I think you need to let people know about this before you tell people that you have parking available.  This information is important for people who might want to go to dinner on the lake but don't realize that getting their vehicle back quickly is a possibility.I've saved the most obvious for last.  The reservation Richard made said that we would have a &quot;standard room&quot; with &quot;two queen beds.&quot;  Our room did NOT have two queen beds.  We had two full-sized beds.  So much for the romantic French Quarter.  My husband did go downstairs to the front desk to ask about the beds, and the man at the desk assured him that he would &quot;check into&quot; this for him.  I guess this never happened.",-1,5,0.507270924

The next day, they offered to move us back to the AJ but by then we had already unpacked.  However, we did visit the room that we reserved at the AJ....much nicer.....instead, we asked the manager to allow us to check out one night early for all the inconvenience they had caused us and the fact that we didn't get the hotel or room we reserved.  He flat out refused and wouldn't provide any renumeration for a less than sub-par room.  His remark was at least they provided a roof over our heads....the location was much further away from where we wanted to be.  And, the reservation that we printed off DID NOT contain the fact that they had a 3 night minimum on it.  They need to clean house here and get some decent folks that know how to treat customers.

I made my reservations three months in advance and called and confirmed the booking two weeks ahead of my arrival date.  I was assured that everything was in order.We arrived early for check-in and the room was not ready.  This was not a problem as the desk clerk allowed us to store our luggage until the room was available.  Before leaving the lobby I asked to verify the accommodations.  I was told that the room had two twin beds instead of the two double beds on the confirmation.  I told the clerk that this was not really acceptable and was told to come back in an hour at check-in time and the problem should be resolved.When we returned, the original clerk was not there and the person at the desk informed me that if I didn't like what they had to offer that I could leave and find another hotel.  Since this was a busy weekend in the city, there were no rooms available.If I had not known anyone in the city, we would have had no choice but to accept the shabby room that was offered.  I got a refund for the room and left.  Fortunately, my brother lives 3 miles away and we were able to take a cab and stay at his home for the weekend.  Obviously, I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.  They are inefficient and really don't seem to care when they make mistakes.  The staff has a take it or leave it attitude.

Room 101, which is entered through the lobby and has windows on Royal street, is no different than sleeping in the street, and YES I understand the noise level in the quarter and have and will spend many years contributing to it, but this was out of hand. It was like we were staying at the aunt of a friend's house out of town who really wasn't comfortable having us there; not in a hurry to put us up, couldn't shove us out the door fast enough. I have an English degree and should be able to articulate my disdain better, but after having driven 9 hours home on less than two hours sleep yesterday, I'm unable to use my big words. Hopefully the guests who had a full-voice singalong outside of my door stayed an extra day to rest up. The staff, although somewhat monosyllabic, were just fine. I think one of the guys felt pretty sorry for us when we were rushing out with all of our stuff to shove in our car which was hastily shoved in front of a tow zone (we were told it would take 30-45 minutes to get the car from where it was parked - Chalmette or something? - and it took 5, which was like a 'AND STAY OUT' cherry on top of this noisy Sunday sundae) and stood by the car while I ran frantically down the street with our luggage.

Too add to the small size was a very noisy outdoor light fixture and shower fixtures that had almost rusted off the wall. The view out the window was of an unattractive alley way.

13368896,"Do not stay at the Andrew Jackson Hotel. I have never experienced any hotel stay like this one in my life. I have stayed at hotels during Christmas and New Years and have never encountered anything like this. (please check my other reviews). My wife &amp; I really wanted to stay at this hotel, instead of a chain hotel. I called the hotel on Dec. 26th to confirm my reservation of a double bed room. The staff said my reservation was fine. I told the staff we would arrive at 10:00 p.m. on Dec. 29th. The moment we checked in there was a problem. The staff told us the heat was broken in our double bed room. (the hotel web site states that the rooms are heated, it was 40 degree weather). I was told they were working on fixing it. Fine, we took a single bed room, our friend was not arriving until the next day. The next morning my wife asked about our double bed room. My wife was shown a double bed room and the front desk clerk stated the maid needed to clean the room first, then it would be ready for us. We went to breakfast, then returned to the hotel an hour later. Upon arriving, the same desk clerk informed us that we could not have the room. When we asked why, we were told we had to call Travelocity, since we did not have a contract with the hotel. My wife asked if their sister hotel St. Pierre had any double bed rooms. The clerk said no. In all the years and places I have travelled, I have never heard of being shown a room, then told I could not have it. Usually, if there is a problem, guests are upgraded, not downgraded. There was no physical way 3 grown adults could even fit into the small single bed they gave us the night before. I called my credit card company with whom I reserved the room with. After they contacted the hotel, they told me to check the hotel St. Pierre. My wife &amp; I walked 3 blocks to that hotel. They indeed had &quot;2&quot; double bed rooms available (we were just told by Andrew Jackson Hotel staff there were no rooms available).  We stayed at hotel St. Pierre until 12/1/08. Please read my review of that hotel. To be fair to the Andrew Jackson hotel, I emailed the G.M. after we returned home, asking why we could not have a double bed room that we had reserved. He replied that he was &quot;vaguely familiar with the situation&quot; and that he would get back with me. I never heard from him again. My credit card company contacted the hotel &amp; the G.M. stated he would resolve the situation with me personally. When I told the credit card company he had not gotten back with me, they contacted him again. The G.M. told the credit card company that the hotel server crashed and he had no information about what happened during my stay. He offered me a 2 free night stay at the hotel. I declined. Why would I go back to this hotel? First my room wasnt available, then it was available, then after it was shown to us, it wasn't available. Their sister hotel had no double rooms available, then it had 2, but the one room with heat (in 40 degree weather) was an extra charge of $20 a night? It has taken me over 1 month to get this situation resolved &amp; I still have no explanation of what happened.

The room was set up for four people to sleep but there was not enough light in the dreary room to be able to get ready.  There was not a dresser in our room.  There wasn't a place to hang towels and it was a chore to try and get one extra towel. The owner was snippy and unhelpful from the first phone call until we checked out.

102723070,"We've travelled from Australia to Whistler more than a dozen times for a ski holiday.  On this occasion we decided to book a condo in Carleton Lodge for our 10 day visit - it boasted being centrally located to both gondolas, lift ticket booths, ski hire, cafe/bars and restrauants.  But the big downside of our stay in Carleton Lodge was that unless we wore earplugs to bed every night we couldn't sleep because of the drunken brawling, shouting and general reverlry on the pedestrian walkways that surround Carleton Lodge after the bars closed around 1am.  Furthermore, we received 2 metres of snow during the 10 day period, so we also experienced bulldozers x2 scraping up snow in their metal buckets on these pedestrian paved walkways from 4.30am every morning! Their reverse high pitched 'beeping' noises only increased our exasperation.  As you know, the last thing you want after a bad night sleep is knowing that your going to have to find the energy to ski all day.  So if your still prepared book in Carleton (and put up with the noise) also check very carefully whether your condo has been renovated as each are individually owned (and confirm that it has wireless internet).  This building is over 25 years old and while most of the condos have been beautifully renovated, others remain in their original condition. Will we stay at Carleton Lodge again? The answer is  - no.   Where will we stay when we return in January 2012 - we think we'll go back to The Gables - they are good value for money, (also all individually owned so also check interior decor before you book),  it's a very quiet  location and its a flat short walk to the gondola.",-1,2,0.469621212

We could not sleep at night as our bedroom window was right over the street and there is a hotdog stand that stays open most of the night. Arguably if you were higher up in the building you may not care so much. However, it is very central, despit being a young couple, we would have preferred to be slightly further away from the noise to enjoy a little more of the mountains and then to walk into town for dinner and drinks. We loved Whistler for the great skiing and the amazing food. If I went back, I would stay away from the holiday season as xmas was too packed on the mountain and we often had to ride down at lunch time after getting bored with the lines. As a Brit it is too far to come for the type of traffic you see over xmas - the resort is easy to drive in and out of so attracts a lot of day trippers. We were not very happy with our condo agent (www.whistlersbest.com) who we thought was lazy and took advantage of us by taking some of our deposit to carry out maintenance on the flat which was nothing to do with us. The dvd was broken as was the stereo and the general up keep of the flat was poor. When we called to say the dvd etc was not working the response was &quot;gee,  is it not&quot; but no effort to fix or replace it. In addition, there was no maid service, so if you come for ten days it ends up being a long time with no maid, given the price we were paying, i would have stayed in a hotel. There are plenty of people who rent in the building so if you are planning further ahead than we did, pick someone else.

549200529,"Stayed in Bronze Unit 202 at The Carleton over Christmas 2017.  I had read on TA that the location was great, but accommodations so-so.  In my estimation, that was a very kind description.  Yes, the location is about as close as one can get to the gondolas, but other high end hotels/condos are no more than 15 meters from the door steps of The Carleton.  The staff at the front desk of the Sundial Boutique (which is who manages and caters to guests' needs) are absolutely wonderful; did all they could to provide us with a few more 'creature comforts.'  Beyond that . . .I would urge you to avoid this privately-owned condo.  The price is EXTREMELY out of line with the poor quality of the accommodations.  I am attaching a few pictures to give you a glimpse into the 'Motel 6' type of upkeep Unit 202 has received.  The kitchen is SPARSELY stocked.  We needed to run the dishwasher after every meal or we would not have had sufficient glasses and plates for our next meal. On top of the less-than-impressive condo upkeep, there is a restaurant on the ground level of the building.  One might think this would be a plus but the restaurant plays very loud music until 11-12pm every night.  The bass reverberates up through the building.  You can feel it thump through the floor and walls.  The price for this condo would suggest luxury accommodations.  THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  If I had known what I now know while arranging our accommodations, I would have opted for another hotel/condo a few meters away rather than pay the hefty price of this condo just because it's so close to the gondolas.We have skied all around the world, and have been willing to pay a bit extra to enjoy comfortable accommodations.  This condo (Bronze Room 202) was a complete miss.  I would not return.",-1,0,0.529285714

127768193,"We stayed at the Carleton Lodge over Spring Break.  We were in Suite 404 (the only 3 bedroom at the Carleton Lodge).  We booked our trip almost a year in advance because we wanted the great location and the three bedroom because we planned to take our 3 kids and my parents on our trip.  My husband and I had been to Whistler twice before and both times we stayed at the Pan Pacific Mountainside.  We had a great experience at the PP and the location of the PP is great, but the largest room they have is a 2 bedroom suite, which was too small for our purposes.When we found the 3 bedroom suite at the Carleton, we were thrilled because we had the same great location (at the base of the Village very close to the Whistler and Blackcomb gondolas) as the Pan Pacific, but with the room for 7 people in one condo.  First the good news, the location is great.  The proximity to the slopes could not be more convenient.  However, as many other reviews have pointed out, the location might be âtooâ central.  It is located directly above the Longhorn saloon, which is a happening, thumping, pumping scene. The noise factor should not be underestimated if you are a light sleeper.  There were a couple of nights that the music was going strong well after 2 a.m. My biggest complaint about the Carleton Lodge was that the condo was not clean. In fact, it was filthy.  There were 4 bathrooms in the condo, which is nice, but they ALL smelled like mildew and not just a little bit.  It got to the point where my mom actually took the shower curtains down and WASHED them.  It was really pretty nasty.  The carpet was filthy and I didnât want my kids sitting on it.  When I opened up the pull-out beds, crumbs (and not just a weekâs worth, more like 6 monthâs worth) came spilling out.  There were mystery stains on the VERY VERY VERY low thread count sheets (100 thread count? Do they make them that low?).  I actually went around pulling up the bedding looking for bedbugs (there werenât any, but it was just so filthy that I needed to check).  You saw built up crud in all the corners of all the rooms. They clean every 3 days (twice in the 7 days we were there), and other than getting the trash and leaving more towels, I donât think they actually cleaned anythingâby the middle of the week, toilets had rings in them and they were still there right after the cleaning crew âcleanedâ.We love Whistler and have already booked a return trip next Spring Break, but we wonât be going back to the Carleton Lodge.  Itâs too bad, because the location is convenient to getting up and down the slopes.  But, we decided that we would sacrifice a bit of that convenience for comfort, cleanliness and service.  The Pan Pacific Village Center has 3 bedroom suites and penthouses.  Weâve already booked a suite for next March.  Itâs not quite as close to the gondolas, but since we have stayed at the PP Mountainside twice and had a great experience, we figured we could at least count on it being clean and having the space we need.  I know that when you stay in a condo, you don't expect the same service you get in a hotel and that was factored into my review (that's why I gave it 3 stars instead of 1), but there is a certain minimum that below which is simply ridiculous and starts getting into the uninhabitable realm.  Also, it is my understanding that the condos are privately owned, so some may be cleaner than the one we stayed in, but I did note that it was the same &quot;cleaning crew&quot; (if you can call them that) cleaning other condos while we were there.",-1,2,0.490394135

They put a ozone machine into the new room in order to further mitigate the allergens.  While awaiting the two hour process outside of the room we researched the health concerns over these machines and ozone gas that lingers.Long story short it was a dreadful week of enduring living in an animal hotel.Events scheduled had to be cancelled due to eye inflammation and time spent in eye clinic and with pharmacist for prescribed medicines to mitigate the health issues arising from this kennel atmosphere.  Another in our group suffered flea bites throughout the week from their room.  Both the eye specialist and pharmacist warning of the harm from the ozone machine itself.  In other words both animal issues and ozone gas cause similar health problems.  Hotel was unsympathetic.

So the food/juice we had brought up to make breakfast had spoiled. Called front desk to let them know what happened and they initially didn't do anything but say they'll send someone up after we check out to fix the fridge (...why would that matter to me?). I pressed for something to be done as we booked the suite so that we'd have a full working kitchen to prep meals and enjoy drinks in our room (this is the second time the fridge has malfunctioned during our two night stay!), front desk employee sounded annoyed and said &quot;well I can't really replace your food right now...&quot; and I had to ask for some sort of compensation and only then did he finally say &quot;Well I'll have to speak to my manager...&quot;, which really should have been his first instinct. He called back to offer to credit us back HALF ($50) of what the food was worth and breakfast vouchers that could only be used for the next 45 mins...I essentially said thanks but no thanks.2) We stayed over the long weekend for a stagette and requested extra towels and robes as we were planning on going to the pool. Upon arrival, no extra towels or robes were in the room. That's fine, as it's easy enough to call someone to bring some up, which they did. 3) When we arrived, the bathroom only had two used rolls left and when we left the room in the morning there was barely any left.

Following the escalation I was given a free breakfast but not a room upgrade even though there were hardly any people staying at this Hilton that night.

370589152,"The previous year, we stayed in the neighbouring hotel for our family skiing trip. We were very pleased with the location and tried to book it again- but as I was a little late with booking, and it was so good, it was fully booked. So we had to book the neighbouring hotel. We thought that with the name &quot;Hilton&quot;, it would be good too- and believed TripAdvisor. BUT it was NOT.It turns out that The Hilton group bought a hotel that had been built for another hotel chain, as the location is good. BUT, it was built as a cheap very poor quality building. Locals told us this. It has no sound proofing at all- look at other reviews too, as some mention that. There are  doors between rooms, to enable families or groups to access the neighbouring room. Sound travels through this as if it wasn't there at all. WE had asked for a quiet room anyway, to help get over jet lag. The first night, we just heard parents screaming at their children in the neighbouring room, as we tried to sleep. I was wondering if I needed to contact the Canadian Social Services as the parents seemed to be shouting so loudly and abusively!I mentioned all of this at the front desk the next morning. They told us that the &quot;family&quot; were moving out that day and a couple were moving into the room, so they did not need to move us. The couple were only talking at normal levels, but we could hear everything. The front desk accepted that and after we had a second sleepless night, they came and put some filling in the gap between the room doors, to try and help dissipate the noise. It helped a tiny bit. The guy told me that they often have to do this, to reduce noise between rooms, as they have quite a few complaints about it. The guy admitted that the building was not an original Hilton, but had been bought from a cheaper hotel group.There were several other things we didn't like about this hotel, but they were overshadowed by our hate of the noise and lack of sleep. We would never recommend it to anyone or stay there again. We don't think that they should be able to accept bookings unless they warn people about noise levels.We have already booked a hotel for next year, to avoid the problem we had this year. It is also a part of the hotel group where we stayed at last year, right next to slopes, but a bit more central. It has great TripAdvisor reviews and we can leave skis and boots at the mountainside hotel in the same chain. It also won't have the problem of snow cats making a noise near the windows. So, hopefully, our love of Whistler will return, as it was ruined by the experience of not being able to sleep and get over jet lag. Avoid this &quot;hotel&quot; at all cost, unless you don't need sleep. I guess for young people coming up from Vancouver for a weekend to party, it would be OK, at the right price.

439036540,"This is my first hotel review ever - DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL IF YOU WANT A RELAXING WEEKEND AWAY. I've stayed in nicer 3 star hotels. Had to be moved twice in one night to dodge parties. My husband and I just returned from staying at this hotel yesterday. Friday night was great. Saturday night was a disaster. We returned to the hotel about 8:30pm after a nice dinner in the village and turned on a movie. Throughout the movie we could hear the noise rising in the adjoining room and across the hall by 10pm the noise was ridiculous. So called the front desk and they moved us. I specifically asked to be moved to a room where there were no parties that we would be sandwiched between. So they moved us and just as we are settling in and drifting off the door next door opens and a dog starts barking, girls start screaming and giggling while something starts pounding the wall - the party begins. They were trying to open the adjoining door. So we called the manager again and she just kept saying &quot;we asked them to quiet down - what do you want me to do?&quot; Well I want to be in a room where I am not surrounded by parties and can just get a good sleep because we came here to relax and this is supposed to be a 4 star hotel. And I don't want to be woken up again when they come in at 2am&quot; Second, &quot;I think you should have some idea where there is a room like this in the hotel so perhaps you could figure it out?&quot; She responds with &quot;I don't know what kind of families are in each room&quot; I said these are not families these are teenagers and how can you not know what rooms they are in - they are likely in the cheapest rooms so just move us away. So she found us a corner room and as I thank the guy who delivers the second set of room keys to us and shut the door I am 99% sure he says in a cheeky voice through the door says &quot;Your Welcome&quot; like he is a 4 year old talking back to his mother. They did give us 2 breakfast vouchers after the first move but the experience was already ruined. Suffice to say the hotel was full of young partying people. You couldn't even get near the hot tub, not that you would want to because they took their room service tray and were eating nachos and dropping them in the hot tub as they ate.  Oh yeah and then they tried to charge us for  video rental we didn't use and instead of looking into it at all, the first thing out of the front desk guy is &quot;you have to pay if it was on for more than 5 minutes&quot; then he checked and sure enough it was some kind of error. Oh yeah and then there were the garbage or recycling trucks that came both Saturday and Sunday morning at between 7:30 and 8am and had there back-up beepers and were banging around the dumpsters as a wake-up call. Then the cranky house keeper who grunted at us like we were an inconvenience when we asked if she could come back in a bit so we could shower and in room #2 the air condition that sounds like a failing jet engine when it came on. (all of which we didn't even complain about) They treated us like every little thing was our fault.

78862005,"The Worst Trip in Whistler --------------Thanks for the âUniqueâ Service of HiltonAs the Labor Day long weekend approaching, my family friends asked me for advice to have a good vacation. After careful discussion, we finally decided to go to Whistler and stay in Hilton because it can accommodate the dog. Havenât been to this beautiful place for almost ten years, my family friends were extremely excited about this trip. However, it turned out to be not just one of the worst experience in whistler, but also the worst of all time----------all thanks to two people:  the hotel manager: Gordon, and assistant manager: Kim.What happened, in short, was that my friendâs family was evicted without refund because they left the dog alone in the room, this conduct not only violated the agreement but also caused quite a trouble when the dog woke up and started panicking. Even though it was my family friendâs first time bringing the dog out, and they were not aware of the restriction, they took full responsibility of the outcome. What âs unacceptable, was the manager and assistant manager dealing in this event. Which was unbelievable rude and childish, in that moment I almost doubted that whether I was in a internationally acclaimed hotel or just in a motel running by a drunken country man. We booked our dinner at 9:00 pm, so we left hotel at 8:40. Since our friendsâ dog was sleepy, they decided to leave the dog sleeping in the room. (of course, at the moment, they didnât know that they should never have done it). We had an ok dinner and returned to hotel at 10:30(we left less then two hours). When we walked, three people dressed in hotelâs uniforms (hotel manager, Gordon, Assistant Manager, Kim and Security Manager, Mark) came to us and asked: âare you Ms. XXX?â My friend said yes and asked nervously whatâs happening. Here is the first round conversation.Gordon(hotel manager):  âyou left your dog alone in the room for 3 hours and gave us quite a big trouble. We received numerous complaints from our tenants and had to call animal control, but even the guy from animal control couldnât help the situation. We tried to contact you, why you donât answer your phone?âMy friend: (took out her cellphone and realized she put it on vibrate mode): âI...I am really sorry. I am really sorry about thisâGordon: âWe canât afford this, we have to refund everyone who complained and give them free meal couponâKim: (the assistant manager, emotionally said): You know I canât take this anymore, one more bark you guys are out of hereâMy friend: (keep nodding):â I know, I understand. I am really sorry for what happen and I promised it wonât happen again. âThen we returned to our rooms, the dog was calmed eventually when she heard us back. Seeing the dog was fine, my girl friend and I went out trying to get some ice. As soon as we left the room, Gordon was there and confronted us again. (even though I was never the owner of the dog )Gordon:  âI want to make sure no more trouble from you people will happen anymore, and I wanted total quietness. â Me: âof course, you wonât hear anythingâGordon (start raising voice): and I want your word, if I received any complaints on you guys again, you people have to leave. And I asked you guy to âput up no resistance when I asked you to leave, there will be no refund and I donât want to hear any arguments from you guys!!)Me: âI got your message, I promised you and I am deeply sorry about what happenedâGordon: (rudely): âOf course you are. Because of this issue, I have lost many valuable customers, and some of them are long term customers.  If it wasnât for me you guys wonât even be standing here now!!  Now can I have your words?!â(reached out his palm)Me: (Shook his hand ): âYes you have my words.âGordon: (turned away and walked toward elevator): âhave a good niteâMe: âYou too, I am really sorry)Gordon: (turned around and shook his arm): No, Sorry  wonât cut it. (start shouting angrily):   !! You know how much I lost tonight?! I have to refund all the customers who were affected, and I have to give away free meal coupons. I lost thousands of dollars because of your inability to control your own dog!!!  Anyway, good nite!!!10 minutes later, when my girlfriend walked out of the room, Gordon was outside again and told my girlfriend that we had to leave because he just got the senior managerâs permission to kick us out and he received another complaint saying that âwe keep walking around and making noise, while he was trying to sleep four hours ago but could never done so because of usâ.  Gordon refused to hear explanation from us and demanded us to leave the hotel right away, threat to bring RCMP if we refused to comply then took off. My friend went downstairs to find a resolution because it was 11:45 already. Gordon refused to talk with my friend instead sending Kim to speak. Eventually they agreed to let my family stay because the dog issue had totally nothing to do us, but my family had to leave without refund while Hilton would contact other Hotel to arrange the transfer. Again, I agree that my friend family should pay the price for their mistakes. However, the way the manager deal with things and talked to us was just unprofessional, disrespectful and absurd. Myself, working in the service industry as a bank teller before, never heard my manager shouting at the customer claiming because of their faults the bank has......even when indeed the customer made a mistake. Luckily, I found the level of service of Hilton right now before I start organizing group events in this location. One thing I have to agree with Gordon, now you not just successfully lose a valuable customer, a potential long-term one, but tons of potentials customers I will refer this hotel.

We were also told it was an extra $25 for blankets for the sofa bed. Sheets are free. We were told the hotel is being renovated soon but the lack of maintenance at $400 a night was shameful.

200655620,"We stayed here for three nights in March for our 2nd year anniversary.  We were not impressed with the Hilton Whistler and felt like we were deceived by Whistler Suite Secrets.  We had bought the three night stay blind, only knowing that it was a 4.5 star accommodation.  The price we paid was still high and we were very disappointed with our room.  I have stayed in similar-looking motels.  There were scuffs everywhere and splatters all over the kitchenette to make it even worse.  As soon as we got into the room we called the front desk to express our disappointment and were transferred to three different people.  The last transfer was to a man who was short with me and said that we could get a beautiful room (guaranteed) for only $250 more per night.  What a joke! It's true that the location is good but there are so many other choices nearby, I will definitely stay elsewhere next time.  Nothing about this place was 4.5 stars.  The lobby, bar and restaurant were nothing special.  The pool, hot tubs and gym were small and not very welcoming either.  The whole layout of the place feels drab and underground.  There are also no nice views either (maybe for $250 more per night but I didn't ask).",-1,1,0.566472663

Service: We left kid's stuff in the room and asked send it back to us. Hilton found it and sent it to 3rd party to courier. That 3rd party asked me to pay $120.

427763804,"OK, so my wife and I travel a ton and stay in a lot of nice hotels.  Most are as rated by users of Trip Advisor.  This Hotel though was a real disappointment.First, we made a last-minute change in our travel plans and decided to go to Whistler.  We called the Hotel day-of, as we were driving to Whistler, selecting the Hotel based on the Trip Advisor reviews and the fact it had rooms with an outdoor balcony.  After introducing ourselves to the woman who answered the phone, we asked a few basic questions and booked a room.  We were then rather curtly told that we could not smoke anywhere in the Hotel (we don't smoke and did not ask if we could smoke) and were also told something along the lines that we could not go up the mountain (we did not ask to go up the mountain).  This was unusual and certainly not hospitable.  The woman sounded young and I would describe her as bold and proud as she told us both things.What we were not told is that we could not sleep past 7:00 AM the next morning!  That was because the Hotel is directly across the street from the entrance to the ski lift, and the entire lift area (about the size of a football field) was being completely rebuilt with lots of heavy construction equipment and about a dozen (or more) construction workers (we arrived at dark and so we could not see the lift area under construction when we arrived, nor was any construction going on at night).  There was all kinds of equipment beeping (going backwards) and lots of hammering and other noises, promptly at 7:00 AM the next morning.  With the &quot;third degree&quot; we voluntarily were given when we booked the room, shouldn't we have been told this?  Especially when &quot;you can't go up the mountain&quot; because the ski lift was being rebuilt?  That's really bad on a whole bunch of fronts.  Also, there is NOT ONE electrical outlet in the bedroom.  Not one!  The Hotel is fairly new and how can this be?  Do they not know about cell phones and iPads?  Also, there is air conditioning in the living room, but no vents in the bedroom, or any way for the cool air to get in the bedroom.  The young lady who we spoke to on the phone also checked us in.  While she was quite knowledgeable, she spoke far too quickly and needs to be trained in a way that she slows down and realizes that not everyone knows where &quot;around the corner&quot; is or that by pointing a certain direction that people will know what she means.  The Hotel is located in a congested, dense commercial area on a curvy street, smack in the middle of the village.  I have a good sense of direction and it's pretty confusing to a first-time visitor.Finally, I travel a ton for business and know how to work coffee makers.  I could not figure out the one in the room.  We had someone come to the room to show us how to use it.  When we asked, the person replied, &quot;Yea, we have to show people often how to use the coffee maker.&quot;  How about getting a coffee maker that people can use??!!Bottom line: There is little that is &quot;Boutique&quot; about the Sundial Boutique Hotel.  I've stayed in dozens of boutique hotels, and have never heard the word &quot;Boutique&quot; in the name, so frequently used in the marketing materials, or used so frequently by the front desk staff.  I've written many reviews for Trip Advisor and this is far and away the worst.  It's like they use the word &quot;Boutique&quot; as a marketing gimmick, but they have no idea what it means.  Anything &quot;Boutique&quot; about this Hotel stops with the overuse/misuse of the word.Sorry, but this was just a really bad stay and bad experience.",-1,13,0.510862685

We had a corner room with a minimal mountain view, which included a premium price compared to other non-mountain view rooms. The room was noisy and I mean noisy. While the room was on the 5th floor, the music and loud (VERY loud) conversations from various bars (at least four different bars within 50 yards of the hotel) started around 2pm and ended well past 11pm. Sorry, I really do not need to listen to other peoples' conversations and profanity. I'm not sure what a parent(s) with small children would do if they had this room given the swearing and drunken singing. Clearly the windows are not soundproof. One morning, around 6:30am, someone at one of the bars or the ticket booth started playing music (LOUDLY) and it stayed on for about 15 minutes!The room itself was small though the kitchen had the necessary cooking items. I could not get the safe to work even after having maintenance come to fix it. One day we could not get into the room--the lock's batteries were dead. Seriously, the staff should replace batteries routinely and not make customers wait 30 minutes to get the lock to work. I tried calling the front desk on a number of occasions (twice for the safe and other times to get our skis ready) and on four separate calls no one answered the phone.We arrived around 7:30pm on the Whistler shuttle and no one from the hotel helped us get our skis, boot bags, and luggage up the stairs---we had to carry this up into the lobby. Still no one from the front desk came to help us once we got into the lobby.I do not know if the non-mountain view rooms have the same noise issue and maybe some people do not care about noise. But for the money we were charged for this room, I expected a far better experience. On our next visit to Whistler we will definitely return to one of the two other properties we've stayed in the past. I would definitely not recommend the Sundial to families with children. And I certainly would not recommend the Sundial to my friends.</span><span class=""taLnk ulBlueLinks moreBtn"" onclick=""widgetEvCall('handlers.clickExpand', event, this);"">More</span>",-1,3,0.519060995

When we told the front desk about it they said that they would investigate it, but the smell and noise continued.On another night there was a fire alarm and when we came back into the room my phone and charger had been fused together by what seemed to be an electrical short. Over the next three days the manager repeatedly avoided speaking to me, I called the front desk to ask for an update two times per day and he never kept his word for getting back to me.

220925055,"So I have some of my friends here from Toronto and decided to book us a stay at this hotel. When we check in the guest services guy tells us that there is an absolute no party and noise policy. That's perfect because we planned on partying outside of the hotel anyhow and just sleeping here. We come in from a night out at 330/4 am and hear the people directly below us partying on their jacuzzi patio and making a lot of noise. Â There is no way that everyone in the hotel didn't hear them but that was fine. I closed the widows and turned my music on so that I can drown out the exterior noise. In the morning when I was up I start gathering all of my belongings. I was looking under the bed trying to grab all my stuff and TOUCHED A USED CONDOM. Â I can't believe that there way a USED CONDOM under my bed. I have never touched a condom in my life and for me to touch a used one I literally gagged and ran to the washroom and scrubbed my hands. Absolutely disgusting. I naturally complained to front desk only for Â them to say sorry and offer me free parking. Free $20 parking? My room was 550 a night, so not cheap. If they showed the slightest amount of concern or compassion then they would not be getting this review. A meal, a sorry from a manager, anything. My opinion is stay anywhere else other than Â this disgusting hotel with G-d awful service. I was better off not bringing my friends here and would highly recommend that you NOT stay here.

I also expect a valet to help get our luggage up the icy-stairs but when I asked for the valet I was told there was not one.  Since I did ask for the valet you would have thought the front desk staff would have at least suggested we use the ramp to make things easier, but they didn't.  We arrived in the dark and couldn't see the ramp so we were surprised when we saw it in the morning.  Additionally, if we came in the front door without ski equipment in our hands, the staff behind the desk would look directly at us and not speak.  How hard is it to smile or say hello when we walk within 5 feet from the desk?  We were just left feeling uncomfortable and as if we were intruding on them.  There was one front-desk employee who was pleasant but I'm not sure of his name. He was British or Irish, I believe?  He actually asked if we needed help with our luggage when we left and I just about fell over at his kindness considering the reaction I received when we checked in and asked for the valet.  The location of the hotel is it's best attribute.  Put on your ski boots and head out to the gondola not far from the front door.  Even still, I will not be staying at this hotel again because when I pay this much for a hotel, I expect a 5-star experience.

This is by no means a hotel, it's a motel at best.  The rooms are small, the beds feel like you're sleeping on springs (probably the worst nights sleep I've ever had), the linen had holes in some of them, i.e. holes in bedspread and blanket, the unit we were in only had a shower stall and no bathtub, the grout in the tile floors either need a massive cleaning or new grout because it's very dirty.  The woodwork on the walls is knicked all through out, the ceiling fan in the room we were in only worked if the bathroom light was on which made me think there was some faulty electrical wiring in the place.  We did have our dogs with us and the place allows dogs.  Those traveling with dogs are put in the first level units and all the first level unit patio doors open to a large enclosed area in the back so everyone's dogs are out there together which is fine.  The problem being is that if you don't close your door you will have other people's dogs wandering through your room, which happened to be the case with us.  What's worst is that someone else's dog went #2 on one of our beds and another dog (or maybe it was the same one, who knows) lifted it's leg and peed on the other bed.  That's when I said we were out of there.  It was bad enough they were charging almost $200 a night (including tax and pet fee) when the place isn't even worth even what a Motel 6 charges a night!!

We stayed for two nights. I had read some of the reviews on here and it is a good place to go with your dog. They are set up very well for them, the floors are tile, they have a dog wash so you can want the sand off, and the dog run by the rooms is nice. The swimming pool at the hotel looked fine (we didn't use it - there's an ocean to play in!). We didn't have any issues with getting breakfast after 9a, there was still plenty and they were restocking. It is your basic cont breakfast: yogurt, breads, oatmeal, cold cereal, hard boiled eggs, juice, milk, and coffee. The staff seemed friendly and they were prompt in cleaning our room. We had to let them know when we would be out with the dog and they cleaned it then. They do have wifi.The room itself was basic: two beds, tv w/ cable, micro, and refrig. The bathroom was huge. The toilet and shower were in their own room with a door which made it easier to get ready for the day. My main issue was with the beds. The mattresses were litteraly 3 inches thick. There were springs poking through every inch of them. Since the mattress was so thin, it meant you're basically sleeping on the box springs with matress springs poking you. I woke up with my hips and shoulders hurting from laying on my side. I was thankful it was only two nights on those beds. I'm not sure I would last a whole week there. The shower was just a shower, no tub (which is fine by me, I'd never take a bath in a motel anyway). The shower enclosure was older and it showed. We did encounter a rather large bug. There was space under the door, so it could have came in there, but it was in the shower. I was not a happy camper. My friend got rid of it and  thankfully we only saw the one. I realize that you are paying for location and the convenience of being able to take your dog with you at this motel, but $178 is pretty steep for it and that doesn't include the nightly pet fee. I'd never stay here without a dog. There are much better hotels, close to the beach, for about the same $ that are way nicer if you don't have a dog. There are other hotels that accept dogs that are nicer, but are not nearly as close to dog beach as this one. I'd be ify on staying here again. It would have to be for no more than two nights. I couldn't sleep on those beds, for that price, for any longer. I would certainly do some more research to see what other places were close that accepted dogs before just booking here again.",-1,4,0.553229974

We liked our stay and the location at Ocean Beach was great , a good local array of restaurants and bars within walking distance and only a 30 minute drive to the busy downtown area. They provided parking for guests and whilst we don't have our dogs with us, hence  it was lovely to be able to meet other guests and their dogs, We didn't have an issue and the dogs staying didn't cause us any inconvenience . The  beds were comfortable and clean however the floors and the bathrooms were not, the floors were very sticky underfoot and the towels etc were stained and extremely small. It was good to have a  coin operated laundry set up and the  unlimited ice machine.

202432428,"I will preface this review by saying that I am a dog owner and I do think it's nice that this hotel offers the ability to stay somewhere with your dog. However, I found this place to be more like a motel that looks better in the photos online than it does in person.My boyfriend wanted to take me to San Diego for a little weekend getaway to belatedly celebrate Valentine's day, and he found a deal for this place through Amazon Locals. I thought that it looked like it could be cute after viewing their website and seeing that they had a pool and &quot;ocean view rooms.&quot; We ultimately opted not to bring my dog so that we could make more of a romantic weekend of it without having to worry about leaving him alone in the hotel all day if we wanted to go explore.So we arrived and saw the place from the outside to which my boyfriend said &quot;it's...quaint?&quot; - sure, that's one way of looking at it. We parked and got out of the car and immediately heard the incessant barking from dogs that had been left in their hotel rooms by their owners. I already knew that could be an issue because my boyfriend is a light sleeper. We checked in at the front desk and got our room keys to our room that was on the second floor with said &quot;ocean view.&quot; Upon opening the door to our room we were greeted with the strong stench of cigarettes and mildew. I then knew why those poor dogs were barking in the rooms downstairs, they probably couldn't stand the smell of the rooms they were cooped up in! The bed looked like the mattress hadn't been changed in years, it had a U shape to it that would have made us both roll into the center at night. The bed cover had a nauseating design and appeared un-washed, which was enough for both of us to decide that staying here would surely kill the romantic vibe of the weekend. Last but not least, the &quot;ocean view&quot; was actually just a view of the jetty and it didn't smell much better outside than it did inside the room. The porch had some old deck furniture and the floor was made of rotting wood. Within 10 minutes of being there, we were BOTH on the phone desperately trying to find another hotel, which was difficult considering it was St. Patrick's day weekend. But we ended up finding space at the Embassy Suites near the Gaslamp and just straight up left because my boyfriend couldn't stand it. We called a few minutes later to tell the guy at the front desk that we left because of the problems mentioned above. He seemed pretty indifferent to what we told him. Fortunately Amazon Locals refunded my boyfriend's money due to the gross misrepresentation of this place online. Seriously, I do think it's nice that this place allows people to bring their dogs, but I think it's WAY overpriced for what it's worth, even when you're buying it discounted through a business like Amazon Locals. Bottom line is, if you're looking for an at least somewhat romantic place with CLEAN beds and NO SMOKING and NO MOLD, then this place is NOT for you! If you're looking for a place that probably doesn't care much about cleanliness because they know dogs will be staying there, then this place is probably what you're looking for. By the way, there is such a thing as third-hand smoke where the toxins from cigarettes linger on carpet and fabric, so if you're thinking of staying there with your children I would advise against it.",-1,3,0.445094563

425958329,"The short version, if you donât want to read about the whole experience:The beds are so springy and uncomfortable, you wonât sleep, the bathrooms are so gross, you wonât want to shower. There was sand on the floor, and in the bed.  The TV remote was broken, the phone in the room didnât work, there was no internet access info, no one answers when you call the front desk, the security latch on the door was brokenâ¦We stayed at Ocean Villa Inn almost two months ago, and it was an experience I hope to forget it entirely, but I still shudder when I think about it, so I feel I should warn potential travelers. Hereâs how it went down:Upon checking in, the reception staff was friendly, but did not include access information for the &quot;complimentary wi-fiâ. This information was also nowhere to be found in the room. This might not have been such an inconvenience, except that I didn't realize that a wi-fi password hadn't been provided until I'm in my pajamas and need to briefly get online around 11pm. Still, no problem, I'll just call down to the front desk. So I pick up the phone in the room, and it had no dial tone. I tried to dial 0 anyway, hung up and tried again to dial a phone number, just to make sure, and nothing happened - I wonder if it's even plugged in, but the wire goes out of sight behind furniture, so I canât tell. Okay, I'll call the front desk with my cell phone... I call and it rings, no answer. I try again two more times, 10 minutes apart, in case someone had briefly stepped away. No answer. At that point, I realize I have to either give up on wi-fi or get dressed and go down to the office to ask in person, but decide itâs not worth doing, because it's possible no one will even be there, since no oneâs answering phones. So I gave up. Meh. I noticed the bed was uncomfortable immediately after getting our room, but not until I attempted to sleep did I realize just how uncomfortable. I lie awake, re-positioning for 2 or 3 hours before realizing around 3:30 AM that it's not going to happen. I already know I canât call down to talk with reception about it, but I get dressed anyway â because I know that I canât stay. I decided if thereâs someone in the office, Iâll ask for a room change, and if there was no one in the office, weâd leaveâ¦There was someone at the front desk. He immediately found us another room â he wasnât surprised about my discomfort, which tells me that management knows how bad the bed is in that room (or in every room?). Well, the bed in the new room was better, but only slightly. It was still pretty bad - springy, uncomfortable. This is disappointing â I had hoped we got âthe bad oneâ, but being in a second room showed me that probably all the beds are roughly around this quality. Iâve spent hundreds of nights in hotel and motel beds, even some hostels, including many places that charged less than a third of what Ocean Villa rents their rooms for, and this was the most uncomfortable bed out of all of them. It is the first time Iâve ever requested a different room because the bed was so uncomfortableâ¦.and the first time Iâve ever given a negative review for a hotel online. When we checked out the next morning, the conversation was short â The guy at the front desk knew about the situation with the beds, and knocked off about 37% of my room charge. I didnât know if he was a manager, or a regular employee, so I didnât complain to him. I just wanted to get out of that place. He didnât actually apologize either â he was kind of just mechanical and complacent in his means of slightly reducing my room rate without expressing actual concern â and he didnât ask, âbesides the bed, how was everything else?â, so I didnât share the rest of my experience. The other stuff didnât matter at that point â if the bed was so bad that we were willing to dress ourselves, pack our bags, and move to another room at almost four in the morning, and they couldnât quite even muster a 40% decrease in our room charge to make up for it, why would he bother to ask (or I bother to tell him) how anything else was? But the truth is, he should have asked âhow was everything elseâ, because there were several other problems. The remote didnât work for the television. There was sand on the floor â in both hotel rooms (we did not go to the beach, and we removed our shoes at the door when we arrived), and there was also sand in the bed in the second room (this was so unsettling, but knowing this was âthe good bedâ between the two, we just dealt with it). The security latch on the door was broken on one room and entirely missing on the second room, which felt super sketchy. And the shower floor is in dire need of replacement, which is actually good news, because the cracks in the floor were so unsightly that I noticed immediately when I went to the bathroom. I later found out the missus noticed too â she thought they were black dog hairs and I thought they were dead bugs or gnats. She actually didnât shower because of this, but I felt dirty from the sand, so (after inspecting the shower floor more closely) I did showerâ¦quickly. There were also other inconsistencies between the two rooms, such as no hair dryer in one room, but a hair dryer in the other room -- comparably minimal - and laughable at this point (trying to stay positive on our vacation), but how are there SO many things wrong? Needless to say, I was embarrassed to have booked this room for a nice getaway in San Diego.Anyway, the solutions to the big problems here (replacing the awful beds, redoing the gross bathrooms) might be costly enough that the owners donât want to or canât address them. Not an excuse â those aspects of the rooms were subpar enough on their own that make this worse than any cheap motel Iâve ever stayed at. But, we could give them the benefit of the doubt if it seemed like they cared about the smaller thingsâ¦ itâs clear they donât. Maybe check periodically to make sure the phones work, along with the tv remotes. Maybe include wi-fi info when people check in, or a sheet with other helpful info, or have that info in the room. Maybe do periodic room cleanliness quality checks after housekeeping has a room ready. Maybe fix the safety latch on your doors â easy things to fix, so that your guests can feel comfortable and safe.Don't gamble on this one folks. As I mentioned, the guy at the checkout desk reduced my rate. We still paid over $100, and I felt terrible giving them my money. The truth is that I would have rather paid twice the original rate to go back and stay at another hotel instead of having the experience I had at this one.",-1,7,0.4916314

For the record Mission Valley has one of the highest crime rates in San Diego at 278pc higher than the national average.

They state the the general manager has the final say and they cannot change his decision. I am calling this a fraudulent charge without merit and without proof. It is theft on the part of Robert Blatt, general manager of the La Quinta San Diego Sea World-Zoo. I probably will never see my money back but I cannot accept to be made out a liar, smoker, and drug user to boot. We are outraged and we feel violated by La Quinta. This specific property has more than 50 documented complaints on TripAdvisor, Yelp, and Google of foul odors in the rooms including marijuana smells. Additionally, some reports are noted of other guests who have also been charged false charges with false claims of marijuana smells. In addition, there are complaints found that also state the marijuana smells do travel from room to room and have been reported to management. Robert Blatt told me specifically there is no way for smells to go between rooms because they have way of preventing that. I'm not sure how that works for a room with an adjoining door like mine that I reported was tampered with during my stay.

Room smelled of moth vballs, filthy furniture, warped unfinished flea market finds for furniture, squeaky beds  with torn ripped old blankets tucked between sheets, broken cracked bathroom sink...Marijuana smokers by pool, Pool fence not working well, so most the time left open,  non smoking policy yet smoking outside rooms in the hallways seemed to be pretty much the norm. Got towels delivered about 9 pm. If you wanted to shower before that, use hand towels. Noisy A/C about 4 inches from bed so either froze or cooked. The breakfast room was not staffed well so food was a hygienic nightmare. I wouldn't eat there and many people .... like us walked in and walked right back out!  Staff was very nice but what can you do with an old hotel with about 50 years of were and tear on it?  Don't brand it with the La Quinta name and ruin the reputation they have of being a clean family friendly hotel with a reasonable  price.

We stayed in the family suite with the bunk bed - there's no door between rooms, the table and 2 chairs were designed for 6 year olds, and their policy is obviously to leave 3 towels no matter how many towels you request. People smoked all the time in the open hallways despite this supposedly being a non-smoking hotel. (see photos) Parking spots are ridiculously small especially for a $10 charge. We stayed for 6 nights because we paid in advance using Travelocity, otherwise we would have gone elsewhere after the first night.  We were awoken the first morning at 3am by noise in the adjacent parking lot. A call to the front office went unanswered. One day no towels were left when they cleaned the room. When we called to ask for towels we were initially told they'd bring some up. About 45 minutes later and no towels, we called again and were told housekeeping was closed for the day and we'd have to wait until morning. Morning came and we were brought 2 towels despite asking for 4! I went to the front office to get the other 2 towels and the bath mat with they also did not leave after cleaning the room. Every other day they only left 3 towels despite requests for 4 - we had to call every singe day to get the 4th towel (except for the day with no towels detailed above). The vanity light in the bathroom can't really be used if anyone is sleeping because there is no door and all of the beds have visibility to the bathroom. We ended up putting blankets in front of the bunk beds to shield our kids from the lights. Having two televisions is pointless as well because they can't be used simultaneously due to the noise.

When we arrived, it was close to midnight as we had traveled from Northern CA to San Diego for a conference for my husband, who is a psychologist. We figured we could make it a family trip and see LEGOLAND with the kids, but we wanted to stay nearby the conference held at Town and Country.  We chose La Quinta since we had stayed at the chain before (not in San Diego, but other locations) and been happy.  My husband checked in, but was told the &quot;key maker&quot; was broken, and would be fixed in the morning.  He was puzzled as to how we would check in and out, so I asked the front desk girl how we would get in and out, and she said maintenance would meet us at the room and let us in.  I thought this would be inconvenient, but we agreed since it was so late and everyone was exhausted.  We parked underneath the parking structure, and rolled the luggage up to the room on the third floor.  Maintenance was not there, but the door was propped open and the lights were on the in the room, so we were able to get in. We walked into the room and looked at the bunk beds, and walked into the main bedroom and looked in the bathroom.  The room smelled musty and old, but nothing too overpowering.   I turned on the lights in the bathroom, and saw that the toilet lid was up, and there was urine in the toilet.  I also saw some movement in the bathtub, and saw small roaches scampering about in the tub.  My children saw an insect on the bunk bed, so we left the room immediately. As we were heading down the elevator, two young girls were standing inside, and wouldn't come out.  One was pulling up her pants.  We assumed they were inebriated since they wouldn't move off the elevator or walk without stumbling once they exited. We never took the luggage off the luggage rack or brought anything into the room, so we wheeled the luggage back downstairs to car and packed up the car.  I walked to the front desk, and told the girl we were checking out, due to roaches being in the room.  She apologized, and said she would report this to her manager at 8:30 in the morning and have our card credited.  I did not return a room key since I did not have one.  We left at approximately 12:30 am, and checked in at the Doubletree at 12:43 am.  Here is where we made a big mistake: trusting that the front desk girl did her job, and told the morning manager that we checked out.  She did not.  My husband checked our credit card, and LQ charged 391 for four days on there.  I called the hotel, and since I was at LEGOLAND had to speak loudly, and I was understandably upset.  The front desk man was smug, rude, and condescending. He said he would &quot;investigate&quot; and call me back in 30 minutes.  He did not.  We were very upset all day by how we were treated, so we left LEGOLAND and went to LQ so my husband could talk to them.  The were even worse in person, insinuating that my husband was a liar, and we were still checked into the room.  How would we get in and out of the hotel with no key?  We checked out 5 minutes after seeing the poor conditions and roaches in the room, and he was not going to return the charge.  They wouldn't tell my husband their names, or the names of the manager.  A manager said his name was Ken Chung, but we are not sure.  My husband had the receipt from our current hotel with check in time, and Ken Chung accused him of making it up.  We have never been treated so horribly in our lives.  They wanted my husband to leave without giving him a refund of any sort since we was upset.  He asked them if he was entitled to being upset considering the circumstances.  That is when he noticed that people that were checking in were STILL not being given a key, and he asked if that was even legal.  The hotel once again was not honest with the key maker which was supposed to be fixed, and the front desk girl who was supposed to check us out immediately.  Should they not instigate their staff?  Or at least call the female on duty that night?  Instead they said we were lying, and would not get a refund.  I told my husband we were calling the police, since this was fraud.  Finally, Ken Chung (?) gave my husband what appeared to be credit on the card, and we left.  He did not run the card, and the numbers on the receipt do not match what we were charged.  We will not stop until a full refund is issued and will take this as far as we need to.  This is fraudulent, and telling a customer they are lying that they checked out is inconceivable.

After settling in we realized that the rooms were indeed separate but there was no door between the two rooms (Wide open).There was noise from above and outside the room all night long. It was so disturbing that I tried to call down to the front desk to complain (I'm not a complainer). I sat for a very long time waiting for someone to answer and finally hung up out of frustration (This was between 8:30 and 9:30PM).Later in the evening/middle of the night there was another round of loud noises from outside the room (Exterior halls) and upstairs. I was tempted to call the front desk again but figured it would get me nowhere and I didn't want to add additional disruption to my family trying to sleep.It gets better...In the morning we went to try and enjoy the included continental breakfast... The place was a mad house with people lining up the complete distance of the room to get food. The tables needed cleaning and we just happened to luck out and grab a table big enough for the four of us as others were leaving. It was disgusting yet amusing at the same time to see the mayhem in what is supposed to be a relaxed environment (Breakfast). We got the basics and out of there asap since it was not something I wanted to submit my family to.Upon checkout, I explained my frustration with the experience and the only words I received in response was &quot;I'm sorry to hear that&quot;. Nothing was done to try and remedy the situation. Even after mentioning that I would never stay at a La Quinta again.NOTE: There is a automatic and required deposit for a safe that is in your room. You have to ask for the refund at checkout if you don't use it. It's not much money but the fact that you have to ask for it back... Out of frustration I completely forgot about it until we were back on the road.Upon our return I utilized the company's website to file an official complaint about our stay.

Spoke to the manager who said nothing could be done as the hotel was full. Spent three nights with restless sleep essentially. And I didn't have time to move to another hotel because of business commitments all weekend. All the water dispensing machines were broken as well, so no luck there either. Not a satisfactory experience at all, unfortunately.",-1,0,0.491071429

The check-in process was very poor and our room was on the third floor, on elevator in each building, ice machine only on two floors. The A/C unit was very loud and noisy all night, hard to sleep. The access to our room was ridiculous as the luggage cart was old and the wheels acted like they were going to come off, the walk way to the room was so narrow the cart barely fit and when I met another customer they had to wait in their room until I got past. The charge for parking which is a rip-off as the parking is so congested it is no wonder they are not responsible for you vehicle, you can barely get your car door open to enter &amp; exit your car. The free breakfast is a joke as the have one area to serve breakfast and with all of the people staying there you have to fight to  get in, get a table and get out. I will not stay here again, needs upgraded and fixed up!",-1,1,0.512314815

The hotel is very poorly lit. We had our dog with us, and at night coming down the stairs to the parking lot which was dark we had to pass through the smoking area which is outside.

To add to the overpowering odor of the room, we started smelling marijuana and cigarettes (in the smoke-free facility) at bedtime, so we called the office to complain.  Back to bed we went, at which time the neighbors decided to have a boisterous party, which included lots of high pitched laughing, banging into walls, jumping off beds, and traipsing around on spike heels.  The party died down around 1 am, at which time someone over there started to flush and shower for a long time.  We needed to leave early to catch a plane, but we were groggy from lack of sleep and had terrible headaches from the obnoxious odors.

(He works in San Diego and always stays at a LaQuinta close to his work site with no problems) I told the person who booked this stay that we had free nights coming to us, and asked how much my bill was going to be. He said that I would have to find out at the hotel after our stay. We checked into a suite, and imagine my surprise when there was no door to the bedroom suite. I called the front desk, and they said they don't have any suites with doors on them. The living area was directly through a large doorway, with NO privacy. The musty smelling bathroom is in the bedroom area, so anyone using the bathroom walked through the bedroom. It was also incredibly noisy, plumbing in the walls banging early in the morning, and everyone who walked by the room at night sounded like a herd of buffalo. BUT, we figured, what the heck, we are only here for 3 nights, and it is free so why complain.While there we needed some extra blankets, and I was told by the front desk they only allow one extra blanket per room. Luckily, she allowed us the extra blanket. The maintenance man was the person who came with our blankets, and helped figure out the fridge. Kudos to him. He was nice.Upon checkout-I receive a bill for $694.00. ??? REALLY? I informed the man at the desk that my husband had several free nights coming to him as he had almost 100,000 points on his member rewards account. Of course, He said he didn't know anything about the rewards points, and that I had to discuss this with them. I asked for the day manager, and of course, he wasn't present that day. So, my husband calls the number on his card, and they said we had to book through their rewards telephone number. NO ONE TOLD ME THIS WHEN I INITIALLY MADE THE RESERVATIONS AT THE 1-800 NUMBER!!! So, I ended up paying almost $700.00 for a shabby hotel room, with no door, stingy blankets, and a grimy feel. I feel extremely ripped off, and of course, the hotel played stupid.

The room had plenty of outlets which services all the electronics one carries these days. The internet was very poor and sporadic, hard to connect and keep a connection. We weren't there to work and use internet so it wasn't a major inconvenience, just annoying to have something not work when it is supposed to.There was a leather love seat that looked like it had a burn hole in the one cushion and the bathroom fixtures had some pitting probably due to the room not having some heat at times. The room was very clean and was serviced every day.We had a king room over looking the beach, great ocean views however, it came with a lot of street noise from motorcycles loud enough to set off car alarms late at night. People walking on the sidewalk you could hear conversations which we not always pleasant. Constant jet planes departing from the airport seemed to fly right over top. If you need peace and quiet this is not the room for you as it was hard to sleep without having the TV on and the climate unit fan on to drown out noises.Our stay was over the weekend and sometimes parking was at a premium as the hotel sells unused parking spaces. but there always seemed to be a space when we needed it, but it is small and some maneuvering needed to be done to get around. Now for the area, our first night checking in was after dark, there was a verbal fight going on around the parking area and the desk clerk seemed concerned with what was going on rather than being courteous as we checked in. It did not set a great mood and had it not been for the great room view and proximity to the beach we probably would have gone somewhere else after that first night.This is definitely a surfers scene, with bars on top of bars, liquor stores,  bikers, skateboarders, garbage can scroungers, and even dope smokers. Store fronts and shops look like they are still stuck in the 60's. If you don't get into this type of scene then you would be better off to stay somewhere else.Most dining options close by were associated with a bar, we did end up eating our first night next door at Shades the desk clerk recommended as being quiet, it of course had a bar and it was not quiet and the food was mediocre, but we were tired and hungry and unfamiliar. After that we ventured by car to other areas for our dining options.As far as safety is concerned one night we walked to the Subway about 2 blocks away and if I were alone I would have never gone out after dark as I did not feel safe or comfortable walking the streets. There are locks on the courtyard doors to the sidewalk that you need to use your room key to enter from the street and should have been secure, but one night one of the doors was not closed all the way allowing anyone from the street to enter, definitely failed security.

The most important issue was that the door to the room would not lock securely when leaving.  Sure, you could engage the deadbolt when you were in the room, but upon leaving this was not an option.  If you put a good amount of pressure on the door, it would pop open every time.  I reported this to the front desk.  It appears that they tried to fix it, but were unsuccessful.  Since I was checking out the following day with no plans to leave my room, I just let it slide.The other disconcerting thing were the tissue shoved into a hole in the back of the room near the portable a/c unit and the towel shoved in the bathroom ceiling where a fan or light fixture was supposed to be.  Shouldn't these items be finished professionally before the room is allowed to have occupants?Check out was underwhelming.  Did not ask how my stay was.  Did not provide a copy of the bill (except the one I had from check-in).  Did not smile.Unrelated to the hotel itself, Ocean Beach and the area around the hotel are not for everybody.  While I found everyone to be friendly and enjoyed the beach-y vibe, the area on/around Newport Ave. did get rather seedy after dark with a good number of unsavory characters roaming around near the hotel.  Very much a surfer/bohemian vibe, which is cool, but you might question walking around alone after dark.

One was in the wall, super old, and smelled awful when on. The other was huge, took up a ton of space in the already tight room, and was quite loud. Fortunately, that helped to drown out the sound of everyone outside.-Which brings me to my next comment - I know the other reviews said that these rooms had paper thin walls, and they really were not kidding.

Every five feet there's a gimmicky bar, head shop, or greasy restaurant.The only true perks of staying at Ocean Beach were that the beach itself was nice (save for the gratuitous amount of sea junk on the shore) and the fact that there were tons of cute dogs out and about.

222500783,"Went on honeymoon and stayed in semi decent hotels for two weeks paying $150 a night or so and had a great time generally.  Until that is we decided to spend a day at the beach.  We looked up San Diego (a 1.5 hour drive form where we were) and found this hotel on the beach.  Yes it was the most expensive place we were to stay at but it was on the beach so we thought we'd have that treat. So to start with the good. It was close to the beach. That's it. Oh and parking and wifi and friendly staff but that's quite standard. Now for the bad: the beach wasn't all that really anyway.  The room was TINY, with the bed (not a massive bed) so overbearing I stubbed my toe four times trying to get round it to the bathroom. The whole place stank of a urinal with the urine-mothball smell.  The bathroom was a joke.  Really to save some time I think I can safely say this was exactly like those Â£99 cheap one week holidays on teletext a few years ago (am I showing my age?) you get when you're 19 to some dodgy Greek Island I.e. Smelly Small rubbish place with the only plus being that it's very cheap (Â£99 including flights and for a whole week).  This was exactly like that, except a) the beach was mediocre at best and b) it is VERY expensive for what it is at $206 inc taxes for the night. The most expensive place we stayed at for our whole honeymoon and by FAR the worst place we have stayed at EVER (including cheap B&amp;Bs in the UK in 5 years of going out with each other). For less money we were staying in executive suites in the US.This place just takes the piss. Warning to any other unsuspecting Brits/tourists in this area- don't bother with this place.  Yes it may be that in the US being in the beach front is some sort of premium (God knows why given how much coastline they have...) but really it is not worth it.  I wish so badly I'd spent an extra few bob on a truly decent place.  It ruined our beach stay.  dont bother with it.  Overpriced !!!!!One last thing, it seems that the US equivalent of chavs stay here as people were just being loud into the night meaning we couldn't sleep.  Plus the aircon was stupidly loud and there weren't proper curtains to block out the sun or people looking in.  All in all a crap place at best. 2 stars instead of 1 because the staff were friendly enough and it was on the beach as advertised with free parking and wifi.",-1,7,0.487564103

We found this hotel through hand online booking agent and it wasn't cheap, in fact it was one of the most expensive hotels we stayed in, and compared to those other hotel, the Ocean Beach Hotel is a overpriced, poor quality establishment. In fact it possibly the worst hotels we stayed in (we stayed in at least 6 different hotels/motels around the state) and the only good thing is its beachside location. I really don't know what the positive Trip Advisor reviewers experienced, but it was clearly not the same thing as we did.

In all fairness, we did have a pet friendly room, but regardless there was so much wrong with this room. It was so disgusting.  You are definitely just paying for the location.

I opened the door and the smell in side was so overwhelming I couldn't fall asleep so I had to buy a scented candle that I burned the entire time I was there. The bathroom was very tiny and didn't look anything like the photos I have seen online. The old tile shower stall made me feel as if I would catch some sort of disease by stepping into it. The paint behind the sink (a good 4 inches thick). The toilet is partially under the sink so you have to sit sideways. There is no electrical outlet in the bathroom and no hair dryer. The telephone didn't work and neither did the remote control for the tv. The wooden blinds had been broken off about a 1/3 of the way down so I had to put a wash cloth over the area where the missing slat was. The bed was extremely uncomfortable. I left really early on my check out day so I wouldn't have to be there anymore. I went to San Diego to have a relaxing weekend and to pamper my self so I decided I would have a nice relaxing time at the beach but that was spoiled by this hotel. Oh yeah, I could hear the conversations easily through the wall of my neighbors and I actually was woken up by hearing my neighbor snoring. That is how thin the walls were.

The surrounding properties, were full of homeless people, people on drugs, we were uncomfortable walking on the street.  It is right on the beach, but when you can not enjoy it because of the surroundings, very overpriced. They had people working in the patio area after 10pm.

The bathroom had hair on the floor, the light switch had dirt around it.  The bathroom tile used to be pink and they painted over it with white paint.  The paint was pealing off on the floor and the walls in our shower.  The paint was peeling off the wall above the toilet.  The inside of the toilet was very stained and scratched up.  The towel rack had rust all on it. They had a portable air conditioning unit that did work ok but was a little loud which maybe was good to cover up the constant airplanes that fly over hotel.  The courtyard is pretty but smells so bad like dog urine that you do not want to sit out there.  The area is not so good, alot of homeless hanging around.  The beach is just ok.  We ended up not even going to this beach and went down to La Jolla which is a 10 minute drive.  Much nicer beach and area.  I feel this hotel overcharges for the beach location.  They ought to invest a little money into the hotel rooms for the amount they charge to stay there.  This was worse than a motel 6.  I would never stay here again and would not recommend anyone to stay here.  The outside of the hotel looks like a boutique hotel but beware of what is on the inside.",-1,0,0.481687243
37761764,"We reserved a room a couple of months in advance and were given a rate of about $150 per night for 3 nights.  After making the reservation, I asked for a confirmation a couple of times but never received it, and forgot to continue following up (bad mistake #1).On arrival we were told that they didn't have us reserved until the next night.  Also, without a confirmation, the rate was now $220, quite a bit more than promised.  We had just driven over from Phoenix with our dogs and thought it would be hard to find a  dog-friendly hotel last minute, so we checked in (bad mistake #2) without first looking at the room (bad mistake #3).  (Also, we fortunately discovered that most hotel chains are dog friendly these days.).At the promised price of $150, we would have tolerated the disgusting room conditions to take advantage of the Ocean Beach charm.  At $220, this was robbery pure and simple.  The supposed recent 2 million dollar renovation didn't include this room.  You might ask what was wrong?  1) Paint peeling off the walls in several places.  2) drawer handles missing from the furniture.  I guess handles weren't really necessary since the drawers were cracked and didn't really close anyway.  3)  I put on white ankle socks which were filthy in 10 seconds.  I realize that it's hard to keep things clean at the beach, but that was just gross.  4) Baseboards cracked and didn't come together with the door jambs. I guess the dirt was keeping them apart.  5) The &quot;patio&quot; had a table and four chairs, one dead plant, empty planters, weeds, and a chunk of concrete missing from the wall.   6) Missing faceplates and exposed wires on electrical outlet. We checked in and tried to get on online to find another place, but couldn't connect to the free wi-fi.  After about an hour, we told the front desk clerk (in person because the phone did not work)  that we preferred not to stay, and were told that they would be keeping the money for the night ($245 after taxes).  No curiosity about why we were dissatisfied.We checked out the next morning (2 days early), and  the same person who checked us in did not even asked why we were leaving.When looking on Trip Advisor when we returned, there was a positive review from some other people who just walked in off the street without a reservation less than a week before and paid only $130, a much better price.  Why were we, with a reservation, charged almost $100 more?Bottom line, unless you're a college kid looking for a beach flop with your buddies, find somewhere else to stay.",-1,2,0.418814935

While it was slightly amusing to hear the police clear the streets at 3 AM, it was not my ideal vacation activity. At 6:30 AM the first flights from San Diego Airport started overhead and continued constantly for an hour, which is loud enough to wake the dead. The location is nice as it is right on the beach and smack in the center of the fun of the community of Ocean Beach, but nowhere near worth the hassle or the cost. All of the above excitement and sleeplessness cost a cool $200/night, and that's after the paltry 15% discount the checkout clerk offered as a consolation for 2 sleepless nights. My recommendation is to stay in downtown San Diego at any of the fabulous hotels, and take a cab roundtrip for the day and visit Ocean Beach.</span><span class=""taLnk ulBlueLinks moreBtn"" onclick=""widgetEvCall('handlers.clickExpand', event, this);"">More</span>",-1,1,0.472735761
135101870,"There are pros and cons to this hotel, but I have to start off by warning fellow Tripadvisors that this hotel has a sign in its front lobby saying something like this: &quot;Love us on Tripadvisor and get $75 off your next stay.&quot; This makes me wonder if the Tripadvisor ratings are superficially inflated and not quite accurate. I am a little surprised that this hotel currently has a 4 1/2 out of 5 star rating on here. Anyways, on to the review. To start with the positives, this hotel has a great location just steps from the beach. It's not the cleanest, prettiest beach in the world. But it is a pretty good beach with fun waves to play in, surf in, or boogie/body board in. There are also restaurants, shops, and bars on the same street as the hotel which was really convenient. But beware that this is not a typical touristy neighborhood; it has a &quot;hippie&quot; vibe and you will probably see a few homeless people in the area (we did). Sunset Cliffs Park is just minutes away (by car), and that's a really pretty place to visit, especially at sunset. We also found that this hotel had a great location for all the other places we wanted to go in San Diego. It's only 15 min from the downtown area (i.e. Petco Park, Balboa Park, etc.) and one of the marinas we were going to, and 20 min or so from La Jolla. The hotel has free parking and free WiFi (we never used the WiFI, so can't comment on that). I did notice that at night there were sometimes only a few spots left in the lot, so hopefully they never run out (they allow other people to park there for a fee). The courtyard area is pretty and a nice place to sit, and we had a balcony with table and chairs (I think all rooms have this, but we had upgraded to partial ocean view which I'd say was worth it).However, I'm not sure if the positives outweigh the negatives. The service wasn't top-notch; we arrived about 30 min before check-in time and asked about getting into our room early. We were told our room was ready, but once we got all our luggage and headed up, we found that the maid was still in our room cleaning. So we had to stand there and wait with all our bags. I totally understand not having our room ready since we got there early, but I wish they would have just told us it wasn't ready yet. And the room was not the cleanest. I am big on clean, so this made me feel uncomfortable. The white door had dirty smudges on it, making it look gross, and we found a hair in the sink, in the shower, and on one of our washcloths. This might seem nitpicky to others, but this really grosses me out. The room was also not in the best repair; the paint behind the sink was was all messed up, like they'd changed the sink but hadn't repainted, or the paint is just wearing off badly. And beware that the bathroom is tiny! You almost have to sit a little sideways on the toilet since the sink is in your face, and there is no counter space in the bathroom at all - just a sink. And be aware that there is no pool (which isn't a huge deal, since the ocean is literally steps away).I don't think that we would ever stay here again. I think for those that are a little less picky about cleanliness and roominess and want a good location, this is the hotel for them.",-1,2,0.519084362

When I handed her my confirmation receipt from Travelocity she proudly announced (after much squinting and at the computer screen) that we were in the system after all.  When we got up to our room on the second floor I seriously contemplated sleeping in the car.  The carpet was old, stained and scary.  The room smelled like a combination of mildew and urine.  (The smell hits you as soon as you open the door)  The sheets were clean but the comforter was stained and disgusting.  The furniture was filthy and the bathroom was small and cramped.  (This coming from someone who lives in the city.  I'm used to small bathrooms) The shower was crumbling and smelly.  I suggest wearing your flip-flops at all times.

138683804,"I really wanted to like this place, because I really wanted a place where we could stay with my two kids (ages 6 and 10) right on the ocean and have a relaxing week off.  But it turned out to be one of the most unpleasant experiences I've ever had in a hotel, so much so that we cut our week long visit short and changed hotels after just one night.In a nutshell:Pros -- neighborhood (if you like this kind of area), proximity to beach, front desk staff, Internet service, free parking, dog friendly, pleasant courtyardCons -- rooms, rooms, roomsFirst the good.  The hotel is right across the street from a nice stretch of beach and one block from the pier, which is fun to walk down.  I took a walk down the pier at 10 pm one night and there must have been 300 people fishing at night.  It was a very sociable atmosphere.The front desk staff at the Ocean Beach Hotel were all very friendly, really great people.  Internet service was fast and reliable once I figured out which network to connect to and got the password.  The courtyard is pleasant, and I met some nice people and dogs there the one evening we were there.  There's an outdoor shower in the courtyard for when you come back from the beach.The hotel is on the main strip in Ocean Beach, which is a lively bustling area full of bars, restaurants, beach shops, tattoo parlors, and the like.  If you like a sort of low-budget vibrant hippie / counter-culture atmosphere with people cruising the bars at midnight you will like this area a lot.  If you're looking for something quieter or more upscale you'll hate it.Unfortunately, the actual accommodations were horrible.The rooms are tiny and the bathrooms are postage-stamp sized.  Both the room and the bath were very run down.  The web site claims that the rooms have all been renovated.  If this is renovated, I hate to think what it was like before.  Our room had dirty walls with cracks in the walls and woodwork, peeling paint over the tiles in the bath, battered furniture, etc.  There was also a musty, mildew smell throughout the room.  It's what I would have expected, and would have found acceptable, for an inexpensive beach front motel.  But for the price Ocean Beach Hotel charges you should expect much better.We booked multiple rooms because we were meeting family members there.  Their room was even worse than ours, so it wasn't just a fluke.In addition to the poor condition of the rooms, the walls are so thin you can hear everything around you, and make no mistake this is a party hotel.  We had one of the most unpleasant nights I've ever had anywhere, as we were kept awake until 4:30 am by multiple loud parties, all of which we could hear through our walls as clearly as if they were in the same room with us.  Every knock on a door, every bang and thump and loud drunken conversation (and there were a LOT of loud drunken conversations, if you can call them that) ... it's as if the neighborhood bars had just relocated to the rooms on the other side of the very thin walls.  We were so tired after one night here that we lost the entire next day of our vacation recovering from the lack of sleep.It's really a shame.  If the Ocean Beach were properly renovated it could be a gem.  But in its current condition I would only stay there if I got a very good deal on the price, and if I were a 20-something looking to party until the wee hours.  If that's you, you may love the Ocean Beach hotel.  If not, I advise looking elsewhere.",-1,2,0.523006912

We only found one decent breakfast facility.I paid extra for the ocean view and overall for the room in excess of 200 USD per night which is more than the Hilton.The free WiFi was fairly easy to log into but the speed was useless and if I sat outside on the tiny balcony the signal was immediately lost.I could hear other guests talking and using the toilet facilities in the night. It sounded like my neighbour may have blown a head gasket in the middle of the night :(What a rip off!GOODThe young lady manning the reception in the evening was quite charming and tried to help me as much as possible. She was delightful. I think that she was doing her best to hold this all together.The aircon worked but it has very noisy and was placed  so close to the edge of the bed that it was impossible sleep with it operating.I shall not return.",-1,2,0.553465545

So small it didn't/ couldn't have a desk.  The bathroom was so small it didn't/ couldn't have a tub.  Bed was awful.  TV was tiny - maybe a 19&quot;.  No breakfast.

This hotel has free parking and a nice courtyard, thats it, the rooms were not at all, accomadating.  They have one washer and one dryer, which rips your clothes, and takes 2 hours to dry.  No hot water, no room service, the rooms were the size of a small master bedroom with a bathroom in it, old torn up furniture, and the beds were awful, I actually kept rolling off the bed.

The sheets and toilet seemed clean, but everything else in the room was dusty and dirty.  The second room we stayed in was in the same shape and the one our friends stayed in had mystery stains all over the carpet. The beds and pillows were hard and uncomfortable (I don't usually notice beds, but these were bad). The worst part of our stay was when the couple in the room next to us had loud sex (screaming, banging, etc.) and due to the paper thin walls it sounded like they were in the room with us. After blasting our TV to try to cover up the noise we called down to the front desk and they said they would ask them to quiet down but unfortunately that didn't work. We switched rooms to be away from that couple. The second night we were woken up by the sound of another couple having sex, but at least this couple wasn't trying to break any records for noise and duration. We slept horribly and were grossed out but I can't imagine how bad it would be for someone travelling with kids to have to hear that. This hotel needs to do some soundproofing since they aren't billing themselves as a youth hostel and are charging more than $120 a night.",-1,0,0.50627572

Our room had a fabulous view of the beach but that was all it had going for it.Area around hotel was dirty, hippy type of town with homeless people all around the hotel and sleeping on the beach day and night. Police were in the area alot.Hotel was dirty. Our bathroom was so bad I took a shower with my flip flops on. Broken tiles, peeling paint, no stopper in the drain (cap for toothpaste went in and went straight down).Wall very thin, could hear neighbors kids at 6 AM and then mom yelling at them for another hour. Street noise was all night long along with the barking dogs in the hotel and on the street. And the planes went over starting promptly at 6 AM and sounded like they were going to scrap the roof they were so low and loud.Big portable A/C unit sitting on the floor on one side of the bed and took up  most of the room on that side of the bed. Nice big sliding window but no screen, so that some one could have literally reached in an touched my husband while we were in bed. And have you ever stayed in a hotel that didn't even have a box of tissues in the room?  I discoved that I had 4 sheets of toilet paper at 6:30 in the morning and there was no back up roll and no tissues. Luckily my husband ran down to the desk and someone was there to give him a roll. I was not happy to say the least!So needless to say we will not be back to that hotel and didn't even like the area.

143372913,"Some of the reviews seem to suggest this is a nice hotel. If you're a twenty something and your aim is to visit noisy bars, have a lot of drinks with locals and don't really mind what type of room you end up in because it's all going on your parents credit card, then it probably is.If however you are expecting a clean room, good, honest service, and a nice location that reflects the price, you will be disappointed. Upon arrival, an hour after check in, check in went well, but alarm bells started ringing when we arrived at the room itself to find it still being cleaned. Not a good start, and an indication of the standard of service offered by this hotel. When we did get into our room, I honestly wondered what the room had been cleaned with, due to the unpleasant smell. Along with this, the bed covers were dusty and unclean, with several spots of what seemed to be cigarette ash.Things didn't improve in the shower, which was complete with cracked tiles, mould in the grout and again a general dirtiness throughout the bathroom suite. On their website, the same shower is shown for each room, along with other duplicated images for different rooms, but this is not what our room looked anything like, so beware.The room itself, apart from smelling unpleasant, was very small with dated decor and fittings, including drawers with missing handles and a door frame that made you think twice about the security of your belongings.The partial ocean view was indeed just that, viewed by leaning out of the window and craning your neck. The view consisted of a concrete pier, reminiscent of 70's Eastern Bloc architecture, a busy main road, and a beach (reached by crossing said road). The important thing to remember here is that this is in California, and there are several hundred miles of far nicer beach to chose from, so do not be fooled by the artistic license in the website photography. If that doesn't take your fancy, there is always the view of the courtyard, complete with flaking paint, crumbling concrete, locals from the beach using the shower, crazy paving just like your grandparents old house, and in our case other bemused residents wondering what they've just spent their money on.We contacted reception to say that we were not happy with the room and would take it at a price that reflected the standard of the room, but only because Comic Con was taking place and all other hotels were booked. The receptionist said that she would contact the manager and let us discuss the matter with him, and that we should wait for him to phone us in our room.She also commented that the price reflected the location. If your after a good location, drive up the coast to San Simeon and check into the Best Western. That's a location, and for only $15 - $20 dollars more...After an hour had passed without any phone call from the manager, so we decided to ask for our refund and leave. Tellingly, when we went to the reception to do so, another resident was doing the exact same. Oddly they were being told that they would need to wait to see if their room was still clean for other guest, even though they hadn't actually used the room.Fortunately we managed to speed things up for ourselves, but only by making it very clear to the other guest who were checking in why we were leaving.There are two telling things about this hotel. Firstly, at the time we were staying it offered a twenty dollar discount for people to place positive reviews placed on Trip Advisor, even though Trip Advisor states reviewers should &quot;have not been offered any incentive or payment originating from the establishment to write this review.&quot; Beware of hotels that feel a need to entice people into contradicting Trip Advisors own terms and conditions. The reviews on Google are far more representative of our experience.Secondly, our money was not refunded when we were told it was. It took a phone call from back home and the leverage that we would refer them onto our credit card company to get the money back, so make sure your booking is done through a credit card too.To sum up, this is an overpriced hotel that is far from boutique image that it uses to portray itself. If the cost of a room was dropped by $50+, then it would be acceptable, but for what you do pay you will be disappointed. I would not normally post such a negative review, but our experience was of a truly dreadful hotel.",-1,0,0.523468745

Her mood never lightened and she was almost unapproachable. There was also advertised free parking. We were lucky enough to get a spot but they did run out of places at night and we saw the same mean lady yelling at the guests that they had to park somewhere else, that there was nothing she could do. We also witnessed her being very unreceptive to guests trying to check in and their reservation had been lost or cancelled--AVOID this place unless you are happy to stay up all night and walk around on sticky floors with crumbling walls and be surrounded by homeless people and partiers all night--there are better values on the beach!!",-1,4,0.594024725

615577036,"This review details the theft of $300 from a backpack left in the lobby of the Courtyard Marriott Mission Valley / San Diego. I was working and staying at this hotel from Friday, September 7th through Sunday, September 9th. Eight other employees and I rented a total of 3 conference rooms and eight guest rooms for the weekend for a sum of more than several thousand dollars.On Saturday, September 8th, at 9:30 pm, I was sitting in the lobby of the Courtyard Marriott Mission Valley / San Diego. I left the lobby and returned to my room but accidentally left behind my backpack. It contained my wallet, laptop, and other miscellaneous items. Later that evening/morning at 3 am, I was woken up by a male employee knocking on my door. He was holding my backpack. He said you left this in the lobby; we caught a âhomeless personâ trying to steal it. He seemed very anxious and spoke with haste. I thanked him, apologized for leaving it, and returned to my room. I was barely awake when that conversation happened. I then checked if everything was there. Laptop, Wallet, AirPods, all there. However, I thought, how did they know it was mine unless the employee went into my wallet. So I checked inside my wallet and, sure enough, the $300 I had cash was missing. I called the front desk and asked for a more detailed recount of events. He told me they saw a âhomeless manâ attempting to leave with my backpack. He said the Front Desk Manager, Nell, would be in at 8 am and it was best to speak with her.Sunday, September 9th at 8 am, I called to speak with Nell. The employee said she was running late and would be in shortly. So I got ready for the day and went down to the lobby at 9 am. This employee told me Nell didnât work until the afternoon. I was a bit perplexed because the overnight front desk employee said she works at 8 am, and the morning front desk employee on the phone said she was running late. Regardless, the Manager on Duty came to speak with me. Ashley is the Food and Beverage Manager who just transferred here five days ago. The primary question I wanted to ask her was, &quot;did an employee see the homeless person rummage through my backpack before attempting to steal it?&quot;She said it was her understanding the employee found the backpack outside. That contradicted the previous story that the person was âtryingâ (i.e., in the midst of the attempt) to steal my bag and they saw him pick it up from the âfour chairs by the door,â (where I left it). Now I'm left with more questions than before I sought answers. So I ask her, &quot;is it your hotelâs policy to go through someoneâs stuff in an attempt to find identification?&quot; She said yes, that is their policy because they &quot;have a duty to locate the owner of the item.&quot; I explained their only duty was to secure their lobby and the item, and wait for someone to report it lost/missing. Now, her words just placed my open wallet in the hands of her overnight employee. She said she would review the tapes and get back to me in a few hours. I explicitly asked, &quot;you can view the tapes? I know at places Iâve worked in the past, only certain people have access.&quot; She said that yes, she could. I returned later that day around 1 pm to follow up. This time, Nell was available. She told me that she worked a double and had been there all morning. How odd! I explained to her I was expecting to hear back from Ashley by now in regards to what she saw on the tape. Nell told me that only the Finance Director and General Manager could view the tapes. Again, another inconsistency.So I told Nell my intention was merely to find out one thing: was the âhomeless manâ seen in person, or on tape, going through my bag before attempting to steal it; or, did he pick it up and try to leave? It just didnât make sense that he would remove my wallet, remove the cash, leave gift cards and credit cards, return the wallet to the bag, then attempt to steal the bag. The only logical theory is that the employee saw the homeless person attempting to steal my bag and apprehended it. In an attempt to find my identification and return it (the hotelâs misguided policy), he saw the $300 and could not resist the temptation. The fact there was already a scapegoat to blame, the homeless person, made it all the more tempting. In a state of anxiety, having just committed theft, he acted irrationally and knocked on my door at 3 am to return the bag. A calm minded person would have slipped a note under my door explaining my bag was found and able to be claimed at the front desk in the morning.  Nell and I spoke politely and respectfully for what seemed like half an hour. I never raised my voice or became agitated. I needed Nellâs assistance; I didnât blame her or the hotel for what happened. I wasnât âmadâ at anyone. She saw that and appeared to attempt helping. She said it was the Finance Director, Philâs, day off; but, she would call him regardless. She did, and they spoke for about 10 minutes. Anxious for an update, I politely asked to interrupt and offered that maybe itâs best we all jump on a call together, rather than relaying messages. She declined and said he was explaining policies to her. It was evident then that the call was more about how to protect the company than to help the customer. She got off the phone and said he canât view the tapes from home but would be in tomorrow and do so. I presented the following. Courtyard Marriott Mission Hills / San Diego has grossly mishandled this situation. Regardless of who stole the money, the hotel mishandled the situation on several levels. If they adequately secured the lobby, the âhomeless personâ would never have been able to attempt stealing my bag in the first place. If their policy were to secure the bag versus search it, the employee would never have held my open wallet in his hands. They then woke me up at 3 am and failed to present a consistent, cohesive story from then forward. Therefore, given all of this, I was willing to accept any form of remuneration (points, gift card, credit) equal to my loss, in exchange for not filing a police report and sharing my experience. While I wanted justice, I was aware of this: if it were, in fact, the âhomeless manâ who stole my money, the police would never be able to apprehend him or return my money; if it were the employee who took my money, the business would press charges of their own against him. Therefore, it was necessary to drag me, the guest, through that process. She explained that if it were a lesser amount she would gladly do so, but that only her Financial Director Phil, or the General Manager, Gary, could approve something like that.I explained she left me with no choice but to go to the police and share my story online.  We filed an incident report together that she told me I was not allowed a copy of. As I was returning to my conference room, a female Front Desk Employee pulled me aside and apologized for the way the hotel management was treating me. She seemed to sympathize with me being so kind and understanding, but getting runaround in return. She said if I wanted to get myself some drinks in the bar later that night, sheâd make sure they got comped from my bill. I was not able to take her up on that offer but appreciated it nonetheless. On Monday, September 10th at 4:45 pm, I called and asked for Phil. It took three tries as the Front Desk Employee told me first he wasnât in today. I explained that Nell told me he worked Monday through Friday, and I was expecting a call from him today. Then he said he was in but already gone home. I asked to speak to the manager on duty. Now his story changed to, actually, here comes Phil now, Iâll transfer you. So once again, this hotel seems to be unable to operate in any other way than sketchy. Our conversation was grievously unproductive. First, Phil told me he did not have any update as he still had more cameras to view. Glad to know I'm a priority! He said he did not see anyone take any money from my bag. I asked, do you mean the âhomeless personâ or your employee. He said he couldnât tell me what he saw on the camera for confidentiality reason. Yet, he just told me what he saw! I asked, whoâs confidentiality is at stake? I didnât know which employee went through my bag, and only had the description of, &quot;a homeless man&quot; for the alleged thief. He said that is just their policy and if I wanted to see the tapes, Iâd have to have the police serve them with a warrant.I protested that all Iâm asking for is a conclusion, not a recount of events. Did or did you not see the âhomeless personâ go through my bag before attempting to steal it? He said, âno, I did not see him go through your bag.â I said okay, so then that means the money had to of left the bag AFTER the employee apprehended it. He jumped in, âNo! No! It couldâve... No! I canât tell you what I saw.â I said, but you just told me what you saw! He, now left with no other plausible explanation other than his employee is at fault, said that our conversation was over and if I wanted to find out what was on the tapes, I needed to file a police report.I said to him, âPhil, I have a witness here, and Iâd like you to answer this on the record, are you telling me, that as a guestâ¦â he interrupted me to say no, he was not willing to be recorded. I explained that I wasnât going to record him, I was merely asking him to give me a statement I could quote. I finished my question, âas a guest, if something goes missing, the policy of the Courtyard Marriott Mission Valley / San Diego is to not help in any way unless forced to by the police?â He protested no, that wasnât their policy. I asked him for a corrected statement, but he refused. He said he was not willing to make a statement on what the policy is when something like this happens. I let him know how disappointed I was with him, the brand and his establishment; and that I felt utterly failed as a customer and guest. While I canât prove it was the employee who stole my money, that point is overshadowed by the bigger picture. If you ever need assistance solving a crime at the Courtyard Marriott, even if youâve spent 10x the amount of the missing money in that weekend alone, you will be railroaded with inconsistency, misinformation, and roadblocks. I was respectful, understanding, and patient. I was given misdirection, lies, and lip service in return. The Finance Director, Phil, stated unless they were legally forced to by the court, they refused to help or provide me any insight into this situation.In conclusion, it is my opinion that the Courtyard Marriott Mission Valley / San Diego is plagued by either a) gross, negligence incompetence at all levels, or b) something more sinister. It is my plea that you never risk your personal belongings, time, and well-being by doing business with this hotel.",-1,18,0.417924894

The first night i had a room full of loud frat types partying all night in their room (white boys rapping).  at 2am i called security, which as I predicted only led to them retaliating all night by banging on the wall, slipping threatening notes under the door, etc.  I was told i couldn't change rooms that night, so after a sleepless night, facing a full day of work, i packed up my belongings, dropped them off at the front desk and demanded they switch my room.  they were not apologetic or even concerned.  just irritated and eventually they begrudgingly agreed.i went over to their &quot;starbucks&quot; counter and ordered a large coffee to go.  it was cold.the new room they assigned me at the end of the day was already occupied, so i trudged back down to get yet another room key.  my colleague's room key failed to work four times, which required trips back to the front desk.my other colleague's room was right across from what used to be an ice machine room, but now is just an open drain that was emanating a foul, rotten odor into the hallway.my new room was quiet -- or else i was just dead to the world after a night of no sleep -- so if you're lucky enough to get a quiet room and you are forced to stay here, you might not mind it.  but why risk it?",-1,1,0.450823954

For example, I got to my room and turned on the TV but every channel was in analog and the remote didnât work. The technician had to come up twice, try some diagnostics from the control center, took apart the back of the TV, couldnât fix it, offered to replace the TV but that it would take several hours of him working in the room.

I call and ask to speak with the property manager, I get put on hold so long the line drops, he/she never calls me back. The technician brings up my new room key. Huh? Then he says he took the liberty of setting up the new room for me, turning on the A/C, etc. Huh? Don't stay here, you can go somewhere else for a much better experience and value for the cost.

112063222,"In town for an Insurance Convention and decided not to stay at the facility accomodations since I prefer Marriott establishments.  I was thrilled to find that there was a new Courtyard within minutes of the convention center.  The rooms and service were adequate: the A/C didn't work @check in, the bathroom light burned out on my 2nd night, noticed black mold the ceiling hallways on the 4th floor and my vehicle was broken into in the parking lot.I contacted the manager John Belm and felt victimized all over again with the debating and judging of the items in the vehicle being fully exposed to the public for theft! Then he continued to inform me that the signage posted &quot;Video Surveillance on Premises&quot; does not mean that the property/parking lot has video.  &quot;Premises means building and that is what is under video&quot;.  Mr. Belm continued to debate the establishments accountablility of liability without any concern for my ordeal.  I was contacting the manager, Mr. Belm to request the corporations insurance information for my insurance company; I didn't need to be victimized again by someone who should be more concerned with the welfare of their customers than debating and argumentative over the liability of the establishment.  That is why we have insurance company to sort out this sort of situations.  If Mr. Belm had taken the time to look up my account information he would have seen that I am a long time customer of the Marriott Corporation and that for whatever the insurance company come to a compromise, the amount I spend in any given year with the Corporation would exceed by 10X or more.  I know that that review may or may not persuade you to stay at this establishment, but the more you know about the &quot;premises&quot; or property/grounds security especially when they are charging a fee to utilize the establishments parking lot the more educational decision can be made.  Also I am not impressed with the chosen person of their customer relations for this establishment.  Maybe I caught him on a bad day; but I think my situation warranted some sort of compassion from a person in that position.  Good Luck on your next stay and hopefully there won't be a crime committed at this establishment anymore severe than a theft of items from a vacant vehicle!",-1,3,0.466287879

Donât Be Fooled...The entryways of the building are protected by surveillance,  NOT the parking lot or any exterior area of the building structure!! Since you pay for parking in their lot, wouldnât you think that the parking dues are for the surveillance on the premisis?! The WHOLE premisis, which includes the exterior parts of the building and the land around the building.Well the manager, John Blem doesnât think so. He told me he wanted to put security cameras in the rooms and that he has been in the hotel business for 20+ years. Well you could, but itâs illegal, so you canât because of the privacy laws. John Blem said that he has never heard of any privacy lawsâ¦REALLY?! When I reported that items were stolen from my vehicle to the front desk and I wanted to look at the security footage of the building, they told me they didnât have any security cameras on the side that I had parked on which was the pool side.

When we visit San Diego, we never seem to have issues staying in the Mission Valley/Hotel Circle area near Qualcomm stadium; boy, we totally misjudged this particular location.  This Marriott was very disappointing!! Our next door neighbor decided to bring their Bluetooth speaker and blast their music, bass and all, the entire night and into the next morning. I called down to the front desk to let them know of the situation and their response was, &quot;Marriott does not tolerate such behavior&quot;. The person I spoke to stated that if more than two hotel guests complained about the same situation/disturbance, the guests causing it would be automatically walked off the property.. Did that happen? NOPE! There were more than enough complaints that evening and unfortunately, nothing was done. The only thing they could offer to assuage us was to provide complimentary parking rather than charging us nightly for the duration of our stay.Honestly, it would have been better had we stayed at the Courtyard Marriott at Liberty Station in Point Loma.Additionally, the room we were provided was only half completed in terms of remodeling.

I specifically stayed here for that choice of room and then that is not what I got. It made the whole stay very uncomfortable and stressful. Not what I was hoping for on vacation!

After calling the hotel and speaking to the Manager Art C. on duty, I was told that I was charged for smoking in the room.  Even after I explained that I don't smoke and have never smoked, he was adamant that I did and that he would not remove the charge.  I am currently fighting this charge...I am compelled to write here to let others know that this is something that's begun to take hold with Marriott Hotels in particular.  I've researched this issue (I invite you to do the same).  I want to state that I hate walking into a room and having it smell like smoke.  I won't stay in it and always ask to be moved to one that's not smoking.  The profession I am in is not conducive for smoking and I am deeply saddened and concerned by the  terrible treatment I've received so far by Marriott Management in this matter.  I urge you to beware....There are many hotels in this area.  It's not called &quot;Hotel Circle&quot; for nothing.  I would suggest something else.  Marriott has gone downhill the past 3-4 years.

I took a shower, and noticed the screws attaching the holder to the tile wall were starting to rust already.  Some were missing caps.  I used the toilet, and noticed the seat was the cheap thin plastic kind.  I started to wonder... is the honeymoon already over?

194373173,"LONG READLet me start off by saying that I do not like the Hotel Circle area of San Diego. Yes it is close to a lot of the local attractions for those people on vacation. I was on a business trip and I was very disappointed to learn that this was the only hotel we could find due to the number of conventions in the area. This was my first and last stay at this hotel I soon learned why there was still rooms available. Just not any good rooms. Having to pay an additional $18.00 per day just to park there did not set well with me either. When we arrived the staff member that greeted up was nice. This young man was as another reviewer stated &quot;FAKE&quot;. If I had wanted a handicap room I could have gotten one right away. I made the wrong choice to wait for the next available king size room. Three hours in fact I waited to have a room assigned to me. And after being told I could get a front view I was ok with that. When I was finally assigned to a room, I almost exploded. I got the last room on floor number six. The only view I got was of the back parking lot. And when I went  back down to complain, I was told that the only room available. Oh well, I was not going to spend much time in the room any way, so i decided to just make the best of it. So I go back up to the room to get my belonging arranged for the next six days.The room itself seemed adequate. That is until I tried to use the internet. The advertised high-speed internet connection was almost non existent. I should have know when the LAN Connection was blurred out in their advertise that something was up. I tried several times to connect to LAN system but that was not happening either. So I called down to the front desk to ask if the internet was out. I was then informed that this hotel does not have an operating LAN system above the fifth floor. Something else that was not advertised. Maybe it would be better in the morning.  That was not to be the case. I then decided to take a shower and get ready for dinner.  The shower was fine, no complaints there. But when I went to step out of the shower and looked to my right I could see all the plumbing pipes for the sink. They looked awful. Just not what I am accustomed to seeing in a Marriott hotel. This is not a sight you want to see when you are paying full price for a second rate hotel.I meet up with a few of my co-workers and off to dinner we went.  We were still operating on East Coast time. Upon returning go the hotel I decided to turn in for the night.Waking up at 2:00 am which was 5:00 am EST I decided to get up and try the internet once again. No different than the previous evening. So I went to take another shower, got dressed for the day and went down to the lobby where I was finally able to get a wi-fi signal strong enough to send an e-mail back to the office to let them know I would be having problems sending reports back to them. For the next five days, I never was able to get a strong enough signal to even make it past my home page. I spent my time down in the lobby along with a lot of other people that could not get a connection in their room. This really sucked. Everyday I was there, I was up and down in the lobby by 2:30 am just to get some work done on the computer. This will never happen again. I will find a room out in the valley and drive the extra miles in to the city just like thousands of other people do everyday.The TV in the room is set up to scam you. If you are not careful you will be paying for movies that you didn't want to watch. I can just imagine the senior citizen that try to utilize the TV system and get charged for something they really didn't want to watch. If you are challenged by modern technology, please be careful with the TV.The so called &quot;Bistro&quot; down stairs is way over priced. I didn't eat there. I also watched them handle to much of the food with bare hands. Not very sanitary if you ask me.Needless to say, I was glad to leave and get home. I love the San Diego area, I just did not enjoy this hotel at all. During the time that I spent in the lobby during the wee hours of the morning, I got to see some very undesirable thing happen which also involved some of the hotel staff members. Yes maybe this is the California way, but lessons in ethics and morals could go a long way in this place. I am sure that someone has discussed all the possible excuses to use with the staff. Or they have been taught how to make them up.STAY AT YOUR OWN RISK AND PLEASE READ THE FINE PRINT",-1,3,0.425025116

I was not happy about the hidden parking fee and brought it up to the front desk when I checked out I was then told that they charge $16.00 dollars for overnight parking and if I had been staying at the Courtyard Marriott in downtown San Diego I would have had to pay $30.00 dollars for parking and to avoid the fee I would have had to park my vehicle off of their property. I then asked the lady where else could I have parked it in that area to avoid the fee and she was not able to give me any answer.

They even had a great bar with some wonderful selections on tap.

I've stayed in lower level rooms in hotels in the middle of New York that were quieter than this room.

When traveling during the weekend, I wasn't surprised when people came and got ice at least 20 times between 9pm and 230am.  The bed and pillows were hard and uncomfortable. I could not fluff the pillow in any way that would be close to comfortable. The a/c in the room was loud, but at least it drowned out some of the freeway sound. The room was one of the handicap accessible rooms, which mean no tub. This is a personal preference, but I am not a fan.As a result of all these issues, I slept at most 2 hrs. Instead of departing in the late morning like I planned, I decided to checkout at 6am and drive home. This is the first time I've stayed on Hotel Circle, so I'm not sure if the other hotels have noise issues too, but I'm not planning on staying at this hotel again. I'd rather drive 2 hrs each way and sleep at home.",-1,0,0.512661791

We reserved the most largest (and most expensive room) since we were meeting our children there and wanted a large gathering space. My husband and I checked in at 9:00 p.m. After waiting in the check in line for 15 minutes we finally got our keys and heade up. When we opened the door we noticed that the capet was FILTHY. Big black stains everywhere. Then we went into to separate bedroom area to find a large blood stain the carpet next to the bed. UGH! It took them 1/2 hour to move us into another suite.....only problem is that it was a converted conference room where the refrigerator and microwave were next to the bed in the separate bedroom not in the dining area and the room was on the main highway. Finally around midnight they moved us into a quieter, yet still filthy suite. The manager assured us he would clean the carptes in our room and my daughter's room.

No message, no &quot;tried but you were out,&quot;  nothing.

When I stepped off on my floor there was dirty linens piled up all over the floor to which I had to navigate my way through to my room.

When I went back downstairs there was no apology just simply giving me another room with 2 queen beds.  When I arrived to that room it was very musty smelling and appeared to have not been rented in some number of days.

There was a Rollin shower but the shower head was mounted about 6 ft high with no arm to lower the shower head and completely unreachable for someone who is wheelchair bound.

Be careful, there is a homeless encampment right behind the main parking lot behind the hotel.  The homeless walk around the cars at night.  The hotel buffet in the morning is terrible.  One of the worst we have ever had.  The lobby is okay, a little dated and what you expect from an older Courtyard.  The room was average.  But, the mattress we had was really old, had holes at the corners, and had stains around the edges when you peeled back the sheets.  The hotel cleaning staff was really great and helpful, but the front desk was pre-occupied and not very attentive.  Seem to have a lot of disorganization that started at the front desk and ran to the restaurant.  Long story I could get into, but I will just say they need better management.

495529790,"Let me start by saying that I am currently a guest at this hotel. My wife and I come to San Diego every couple of months and always stay on Hotel Circle and the surrounding area. We have stayed at the Sheraton, 4 Points by Sheraton, Hilton, Town and Country, Best Western 7 Seas, and now the Courtyard Marriott. While the rooms are comfortable, and fairly quiet, I don't feel that this hotel is on par with others in the same class. What I liked:The pool area has a nice layout and is enjoyable to just sit and relax and the fitness center is one of the better ones that I have seen in this area. The Bistro has good food at a fair price and the sitting areas are fairly peaceful, with the exception of the occasional unattended minor. What I didn't like:The parking fee is an outrageous $20 a day. When you order food from your room, you have to go and pick it up from the Bistro. The &quot;free&quot; wifi is painfully slow, but for an additional $5 a day, you can &quot;upgrade&quot; to decent speeds. Several of the TV channels had very poor reception and had a grainy picture.I was willing to overlook all of this based on the fact that next to the TV is a panel that supposedly allows you to connect any external media devices, or so I thought. Upon connecting to this panel via HDMI and attempting to use our laptop on the television, it would not work. Upon further inspection, I noticed that there is no connection from this panel to the TV via HDMI. So, I connected the laptop straight to the TV via HDMI. This also failed to produce any results. I have stayed at other hotels with this issue in the past, and a call to the front desk usually resolves this issue. This was not the case at this hotel. My wife attempted to call the front desk and was not able to get anyone to pick up the phone. After 5 tries, we attempted to call housekeeping, with the hope that they would be able to help and luckily someone answered right away. We asked about the HDMI connection from the panel to the TV and he seemed willing to help. He asked us to wait for a moment while he checked with someone else. Once he came back on the phone, we were given the explanation that the HDMI ports on the TV were purposely disabled for &quot;SECURITY PURPOSES&quot;. WHO are you trying to kid with that explanation. If you don't want me to connect my devices, so that you can attempt to charge me for PPV movies, then just tell me that. Don't BS me with a fake excuse so that you can attempt to charge me more money. Had the connection panel not been in the room, I would be more inclined to overlook the lack of connectivity options. However, I have never stayed at a hotel with one of these connection panels that did not allow you to use them. Why even bother to install the panel in the first place? In conclusion,I would not stay here again given the choice. I definitely wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone who likes to travel with and use any modern technological devices.For the same price per night, you can stay 2 doors down at the Best Western, with free parking, decent free wifi, and the ability to connect your HDMI devices to the TV.",-1,3,0.440939932

Service was so poor. There was only a few waiters and waitresses to serve 245 guests. Bread was served cold and hard, Salad was spread out on the plate to look like there was a lot.

It was a mess.What's telling, is that I am writing the third highly negative Trip Advisor reviewer for this past weekend.In Short: - Checkin process was miserable. - Room was filthy.  Big clump of hair on bed- Bar was understaffed, out of many food items, and the POS system was down.  We were unable to obtain food- There were multiple events happening.  There were tons of people, and pandemonium- When I checked out I asked to talk to a manager.  There was none on site, except a 20 something front desk supervisor.  He offered me 10 bucks internet credit for my troubles.Something was amiss this weekend, and I hope they fix it.  So far it has cost me near $200 bucks for a place that was un-stay-able.  We moved to an elegant place downtown.For the record, I am a frequent Hilton customer.  I did talk to the banquet manager later on, who seemed sincere and told me the GM would contact me.

The rate was extremely high for not having access to the things I was suppose to have  access to. For example, executive lounge, pool, and parking.. The pool was under construction/remodeling meaning we had to go to another hotel in a shuttle and then after being done in the pool we had to call and ask for a shuttle again inconvenient .. the parking was annoying, and the front desk personal didn't seem to be very welcoming or nice.

We talked to the manager the day after, but they said that they are sorry and the old woman did not know her room number.  (a very funny reason to break into our room !!!!)

The closet and the bathroom shelves were very beat up and full of dust and scratches. The rest of the room, the shower, carpet and bed were clean and in good condition. Most of the staff was very friendly except for one person. This was the girl working in the restaurant during breakfast. I donât recall her name. She was wearing a red hooded sweatshirt (not a uniform). At first we didnât think she even worked there. I travel a lot, and have had gold status with Hilton for many years, and this is the first time I have ever complained to the hotel about someone. This is how unprofessional and rude she was. It was so bad I almost checked out. I complained to the front desk but heard nothing back. There are some very good restaurants in walking distance, but you have to pass buy a lot of homeless people sleeping on the sides of the streets. Would never stay here again.",-1,0,0.478412698
322787389,"If customer service is important to you, you will be sorely disappointed at this hotel. I called ahead of time to request a certain type of room. The phone rang off the hook never to be answered. I called again later and had the same result. Finally got through and was told they'd try and it was clear they didn't preassign anything or take the time to really note my preferences. Oh well. The room I got was decent. It seemed clean and well stocked to begin with. But that's about the only positive thing there is to say. I called the front desk and after it rang and rang and rang I was finally put on hold for 5 minutes. So I finished getting ready and called back and was immediately put on hold without even a &quot;please hold&quot; just clunk and straight to hold music. Nice. I called because my sink drain had a horrible smell coming from it and didn't drain properly and only one set of lights in my bathroom were functioning. (lights above and below mirror - only my lower ones worked) In addition there was no magnifying mirror in the bathroom (as was pictured on line). When I returned from work the only thing that had changed was the lights were fixed. I was given a magnifying mirror that wouldn't turn on and my drain hadn't been addressed at all. And for some reason I only got one new towel, no hand towels or washcloths.  So I called again the next morning to ask for another mirror and for the sink to PLEASE be fixed and bleached (the smell was atrocious). Next day I got another non-working mirror but at least the sink had finally been fixed. Just in time for me to check out. To top it all off, the pillows were very lumpy and the AC wasn't up to par for the climate. Parking in the garage is VERY tight. Expect some door dings.",-1,0,0.546329365

502664952,"We had a one night stay for a special birthday weekend in San Diego. We were sleeping and at 2:30 am we awakened by screaming, yelling &quot;F&quot; bombs and running thru the hallways. I called the front desk and they said they were sending up security. I'm not sure if security responded because the yelling and screaming continued in the room next to ours. We just fell back to sleep at 4:00 and at 4:30 we heard a knock at our door and when I opened it was some random Hispanic guy requesting to &quot;talk to someone inside&quot;. I told him he has the wrong room and sent him away and again called security. They again stated they would send security. Our room was on the 10th floor and it made me concerned about the level of security here. Shortly thereafter, the next room with the same yelling and screaming then spilled out into the hallway again. I then called the front office again and I heard outside the room security identify themselves. I called the front office again and asked to speak to the manager. The person answering the said she would have the manager contact me later that morning. I went to the reception desk to check out at 10 am having not been contacted by the manager as promised. I approached the reception person and requested to speak to the manager. The receptionist alerted the manager that I wanted to speak to her. He said she would be out shortly. I stood at the counter for 5 minutes and the receptionist then again notified the manager I needed to speak to her. The second time she met me. I explained the situation to her and she insisted that the multiple problems were taken care of her. I let her know that I disagreed. I mentioned to her if she had properly handled the problem why was it that she allowed the next room to continue to scream and yell for at least 3-4 hours with 2 times the screaming and yelling spilling out into the hallways? I asked her how she was going to make amends for the problem with my wife and I not being able to sleep most of the night. She then sarcastically responded with her clapping her hands together saying that short of refunding the one night I wouldn't be happy. She never provided any options but if she was going to refund the one night stay I though that was fair. I still have many concerns regarding the security in the hotel. Were the people yelling and screaming in the room next door to our room and into the hallways paying guests of the hotel? Why was the random Hispanic guy allowed to enter the paying guest floors? I would have expected her to be more professional and less sarcastic handling a guest's legitimate concern and complaint.",-1,6,0.339580133
356132332,"My wife and I, as well as another couple, stayed at this Hotel for one night before our flight the following morning. To be up front, this review will be negative. In fairness, their computer system was down but that is not the reason for the poor review. I believe you see how a Hotel truly is when things are at their worst.As part of a 10 day vacation in September 2015, our final night was at this hotel. We had stayed the majority of the time at another Hilton property on the water plus drove to Las Vegas for a few nights before returning to San Diego the night before our flight. We checked in and here is where things got ugly. The area at the front of the hotel where you park to check in was full of cars. We were at the hotel exactly at 3pm (check in time) but generally don't see that many people precisely at check in time. Once I went to the desk I knew why. There were about 5 people standing in what I eventually realized was a make-shift line. The confusion was I saw them holding room keys and they were quite a ways away from the desk so I didn't immediately realize they were waiting for the desk to free up. My friend and I (both Diamond members) got in line and waited to be helped. There was only one person behind the desk who was taking an extremely long time with each quest. When we finally got to the desk an hour plus later, we understood what was taking so long. Their computer system was down which prevented them from issuing keys. They couldnât look up any reservations and were at a loss for most basic parts of the check in process. My buddy luckily had his keys pre-made and they noted he was a Diamond member. I however, was not so lucky. I did not receive my keys and had to find (which was not easy with the sear number of people needing this service) a hotel employee to take me to my room and let me in. This is amazing incontinent when traveling with friends as you will leave your room several time to meet up with friend. God help you if you leave and realize you left something in your room.  While waiting to get someone to take us to our rooms we deiced to have a drink at the bar. Here again there were issues. They were NOT able to take room charges, this is unfortunate as I enjoy taking advantage of getting point for my purchases at the hotel plus there was a double point promotion going on at this time. As so many other people were in a similar predicament, the bar was of course full with only one bartender. This mean the time it took to get our drink was long. I could go on with more example of how inconvenient the system being down was but I think I made my point. There were other issues that truly made this a bad experience.Our room was okay for a Hilton standard. The room was clean and looked to have been updated recently. My issue was the climate control. Not only was it loud, it was either too cold or too warm even when change the temperature by one degree. The hotel allows dogs apparently and the entire night my wife and I (plus our friends) were woken up by the sound of a barking dog. In the morning the system was still offline which lead to confusion at breakfast. The lines were so long and the service was so slow that we had to leave without eating in order to catch our flight. I did eventually get my welcome benefits but that was after I went back down later that night when thing quieted down. We always ensure to stay hydrated before a long flight so I picked up a few drinks and a small snack for the room that night, when I finally got the bill from the hotel (it took over a week to get the system fixed) there were extra charges for the snacks and a pay movie that we didnât order. Now to be clear, it took one call to get these incorrect charges fixed but againâ¦ really? I was promised 10,000 bonus Hilton points for my troubles (that was the only compensation I was offered) but never got the points added to my account to this day. I took my time before writing this review. In all honesty I was extremely upset and didnât want my emotions influencing this review. Looking back now I think what I remember most is the poor couple who was having their wedding at the hotel during my stay. With all the problems, I am sure their wedding was unlikely the best it could have been and I feel bad for them. Hopefully it wasnât as bad as Iâm imagining for them and they enjoyed one of the most important days of their lives. I cannot recommend staying here but maybe things are better now. I just know I will never stay at this hotel again.",-1,1,0.51622549

Breakfast actually ended at 10 am and those arriving later were out of luck. The lounge was totally packed and there were a number of families with noisy kids!

The tile work was not completed, there was missing trim board above the private toilet room door, the tub was cracked, etc. For lack of a better expression the renovations were just lipstick on a pig. The only positives about the hotel that I can think of are the location and Leo at the front desk. As mentioned above, the description on the website was very deceiving. A suite would indicate that there would be more space than a typical hotel room such as a living room type area with a separate sleeping area. The room that we were put in is one of the smallest hotel rooms I have ever stayed in. The &quot;walk in&quot; shower requires about a 2 and a half foot step up to climb into the tub with no shower curtain. There is only one TV despite the website advertising 2 51&quot; HDTV's. The room also had no towels or a blow dryer. We were not satisfied with the room from the moment we checked in and made it known. Absolutely frustrating and would not recommend to stay here.",-1,0,0.46155754

While we tried to cancel our reservation they charged us for 2 nights that we didn't even stay at. We tried to tell them there were unsafe people in the parking lot and that we have children and we are not staying there with our children. But they continued to deny and they still charged us. We tried to ask them to just charge us for one night they said since we stayed with a group and we made the reservation a long time ago they would still charge us. Then a while later (after finding a new hotel) we called back for the refund. They said &quot;ok there is a $50 canceling fee.&quot; So we said ok great. But then they said &quot;did you call a little while ago?&quot; We said &quot;yes.&quot; They said &quot;oh then we are going to have to charge you for the 2 nights.&quot; Ok so they charged us for nights we didn't stay at and were extremely rude to us.

I chose this based on TripAdvisor reviews but if you head over to Yelp, their reviews are very much in line with what we experienced. When I arrived to check in, the lobby was locked and I had to wait at least 5 minutes for the night manager to arrive. In the room the carpet not only had stains, but it didn't look vacuumed. The table was either dirty and/or it had water rings on it. The bench had crumbs on it. One of the beds had 4 long hairs on it and there was at least one hair underneath the covers. When I went down to the lobby to complain, I once again had to wait at least another 5 minutes for the manager to arrive. When he did, I had to wait behind the &quot;cash&quot; customer. Nothing against paying cash but typically not something you want to see at the hotel you are staying at. Also many sketchy people hanging around this hotel. Could have just been a bad night. I told the manager I wanted to move hotels and wanted my money back. After some discussion, he offered to refund all but $100 of the $308 charge for two nights. We moved to the hotel next door for about the same price but so much nicer...Holiday Inn Express. The next morning, as we left for an event at 8:30a, there were at least 6 police cars at Hotel Iris. The police had a presence at the hotel for at least 5 hours. I requested  for a full refund with their corporate office but have not got a reply.

This recent trip made it even worst. When heading to San Diego I get a call from &quot;Mike&quot; the front desk saying they ran my card and it didn't go though so they couldn't keep my reservation! In his words he tells me &quot;You will need to find another hotel&quot; mind this I called the day before to verify that i will be paying cash for our stay and got the okay from 2 different front desk clerks &quot;Mike&quot; being one of them. Never once did they tell me I needed anything else prior to arriving in order to confirm our room. We were doing a late check in as that. Mike had a really bad attitude &amp; didn't want help at this point. So finally after arguing,yes arguing with him which I felt like it didn't need to get to this point, he tells me if I can put a least 50.00 on my card I will be okay, so here we go trying to find a bank to load the money. I usually pay everything cash since I don't really use any bank or credit cards. We had to back track 30 mins back into town. Fast forward we get to the hotel and not once did we get an apology for the rudeness we received. So next day I went to the front desk and ask for a manager or supervisor. Quincy was the manager on site and he did apologize for his staff action and gives me a 5% discount on my next stay if I decided to stay next time.I had booked this room way in advance more like a month or so.

She had flowers and a cake and chocolate covered strawberries delivered to the room.  I don't think &quot;We can't do that&quot; is part of Nathans vocabulary.  Kudos to you Nathan.There is not a dining room on the property.  Only the cafe and Charlies sport bar.  The staff at Charlies was wonderful.There is an upscale shopping center located behind the hotel and the trolley station is there.  We did go to the mall and made use of the trolley  There is a lot of walking involved in both places.  The trolley, of course, stops a few blocks from where you want to be.  We were able to go where we wanted.We had one strange request.  We wanted a Coke, not Pepsi we were told that the property only uses Pepsi products.  We asked if perhaps the gift shop might carry Coke.  We were told the gift shop was closed.  Another &quot;we can't do that&quot;.  We walked to the open gift shop and bought a Coke.The web site promises a lot of things that the hotel does not deliver.  If you are grouchy old ladies and persistent you can eventually get what you want.Would i stay here again----no.  Would i recommend it-----no.  I will say again that Nathan Hanner and Aida Orantes and the staff at Charlies have read the web site and delivered.",-1,1,0.499115646

19299003,"I recently stayed at the Town and Country Hotel for a conference, and I absolutely will never willingly set foot here again;  in fact, I'm also recommending to my employer that we never schedule another seminar there.  I hadn't read any reviews whatsoever about the place before heading there, so I didn't have any preconceived notions about what I would find, other than the pictures on the hotel's website.  Needless to say, the hotel is completely unacceptable as a business destination.  So, where to begin...* AccommodationsThe room we stayed in was in one of the hotel's two towers, known as the Regency.  The hotel was decrepit.  Everywhere you look, paint is scraped and chipped, lightbulbs are burnt out (and allowed to stay that way), windows have dirt in the corners, there are dings in the walls and door jambs, and other such problems.  Our room itself has obviously not been updated since the late 80's, to include the comforter, which was faded and frayed.  The bathroom is lit by two dim bulbs, which is fine, since brighter light would have drawn even more attention to the stained bathtub, yellowed and peeling grout, and rusty hinges on the door.  The door itself looks like it has been repeatedly urinated on, as it is streaked yellow.The air conditioning in our room was so pitiful that we ran it non-stop from the time we arrived to the time we left, and it was never able to bring the room temp below 72Âº.  It was also unable to remove the mugginess from the air.  We slept with the window open the first night, but, sad to say, our room faced the San Diego Herald-Tribune loading docks, so at 3:30 AM we were assailed with the crash of tractor-trailers backing up to receive shipments of newspapers.  The window stayed closed after that.The grounds were beautiful, with rose bushes everywhere, and arbors, trellises, and cute little architectural touches in abundance.  Of course, many of those touches, such as ornamental scrollwork, were straight from Home Depot and simply glued in place and painted;  they were often askew or chipped and peeling.  It was the equivalent of adding as much garnish to a dinner plate as possible to try and hide the fact that the main course was only so much boiled shoe-leather.In addition to everything else, our toilet stopped flushing on the second day.  After we called maintenance to fix it, it wouldn't stop flushing.  It's feast or famine at the Town &amp; Country.  Speaking of famine... * FoodBusiness travelers and convention-goers are usually on a time crunch, as they have only so much time to eat and then be back at the next session or class.  The food service at the hotel was so slow that a number of us had to skip meals or eat cold cuts from the deli;  when you have only an hour and it takes 40 minutes to get just your drinks, there is a problem.  The food was also sub-par;  the breakfast buffet at the Terrace Cafe is to be avoided at all costs.  The food is cold, rubbery, and of a quality well below that of most fast-food places.  The ribs at Kelly's Steakhouse were overdone and dried out, as was the BBQ chicken;  the only thing worth eating was the appetizer.  Charlie's Bar &amp; Grill was agonizingly slow and overpriced;  $13 hamburgers and expensive sodas can quickly eat up your per-diem allowance. * ConnectivityAs a business traveler, it is essential to stay connected to the office, and Internet access is a key part of that for anyone operating in the 21st century.  Here, too, the Town and Country was a let-down.  With no wired access, you are forced to purchase ($3 an hour or $10 for 24 hours) wi-fi access through a vendor called LodgeNet.  However, the access was so spotty that I was unable to reliably check email, and had to spend over ninety minutes on the phone with LodgeNet tech support to even get connected.  * StaffThe front-office staff were professional to the point of being brusque, but I only had to deal with them rarely.  The waitstaff at Kelly's were utterly clueless, even to the point of failing to unlock the front door on time (we had to go in through the lounge and then tell them that the door was still locked).  The waitstaff at Charlie's were arrogant and ignorant of the needs of the customers.  The only two places I found excellent staff were at the Trellises restaurant and the in the housekeeping staff.  At Trellises, both Angelica and Jesus, and a third gentleman whose name I didn't catch, were charming and responsive, and the food was excellent.  As for the housekeeping staff, they did an excellent job with what they had to work with, and our housekeeper took extra special care with my boys' stuffed animals and even hung our wet swimsuits back up after having cleaned the bathroom.  * ConclusionsOverall, the front-line staff are doing the best they can in the absence of involved and commited top management, which may either be uninterested or incapable of improving the place.  The Town and Country has the feeling of a sinking cruise liner;  the band is still playing, but the ship is getting lower and lower in the water, and it is only a matter of time before it slips beneath the waves.  Unless it is saved by a rescuer with an infusion of cash and competence, the Town and Country does not have much longer to live.  I have already sent a note to our central education office (of a government agency with 160,000 employees) asking them to avoid scheduling us at this hotel in the future.",-1,1,0.528336273

184809936,"Stayed here for an educational conference in November. Had previously stayed back in the Spring for conference planning. Back in the Spring had a nice king bedded 4 post bed in the tower. When I came back this Fall, I was told I was in the 2 level building and only had double beds (no king) available even though I was one of the first to check in for the week and was part of the conference planning committee (had even mentioned that in the reservation). I had even paid extra on the conference website for a tower room! Went to the room and had to climb a flight of stairs with 2 maxed out check-in bags (no elevators) Got to the room 3776 and really felt like I got the bait and switch. Couldn't switch right away as I had back to back meetings that I couldn't miss. Room was small compared to the Spring and the bathroom ceilings are like 7 feet tall. Felt like I was in a Laura Ingalls dollhouse with decor to match. I had a corner room  but next to the housekeeping closet. They went in at all hours especially after 8pm. Quite noisy even though I left the do not disturb sign out. I also was above what seemed to be the employee office punch in area. I think they all gathered around to smoke as I kept smelling it up in my room and when I went out, it looked like employees milling around and smoking. Internet kicked me out 2 out of the three days I bought it so complained and they refunded the fee (however it was a work trip so internet needed to work). Housekeeping wouldn't replace the toiletries on a daily basis even though it was clear I was using up the shampoo every day; had to ask when I saw one of the carts later. Had to leave a note to have the batteries replaced in the TV as it didn't work (at least they did that promptly). Didn't have breakfast as I heard from colleagues it was pricey so made a stop on my daily run to the AM/PM about 10 minutes away for take home breakfast. Didn't want to spend the $5 a day for the gym (that seemed to be the mantra as I saw many colleagues running every morning). Wifi cost $8  day but didn't work for two of the days. On the day I departed I needed to catch an early shuttle and requested a 4am wake up call. Never rang so thank goodness for iphone and ipad alarms. When I did depart the lobby was closed and you had to ring to get in. Had to wait 10 minutes before someone let me in. Colleague had a car and she had to pay for parking. Only thing this hotel had going for it was the proximity to the mall and trolley. But guess what, the Marriott across the freeway that I thought was not foot accessible has an underpass (other colleagues stayed there) so I will be definitely staying at the Marriott next time. Maybe if the T&amp;C would have honored my reservation of being in the Tower  it would  have made my stay better but it was a big time fail this time.",-1,1,0.284298584

511014818,"I had to book a San Diego room last minute and the wife mentioned staying at this &quot;motel&quot; 10 years ago and it was fine then.  Well times have changed.  So many negatives, I'm not sure where to start.  I hope I can post more than 1 photo of the filthy room.NOT AS CHEAP AS YOU THINK.   So the room was advertised on Booking.com as being $104 per night.  Two nights should be around $208 plus some taxes.  Well the final cost was $310.  There should be a law to force hotels to list &quot;EXPECTED&quot; price.  This is one of those places that charges a hidden &quot;resort&quot; fee. Far from a resort.  It is simply a hidden fee listed on the receipt as $16 &quot;hotel services leisure fee&quot;.  Then there is a $20 per night parking fee (20% of the cost of the room added on).  Then add in over 10% city tax, California tourism assessment, occupancy tax, and you are 50% more than what they lead you to believe in advertisements.LONG CHECKIN LINE.  Like others mention, I was in line 20 minutes and that was with only 2 people in front of me.  They are slow and too few people to help.  Then I find out they had the wrong days for me to stay and said I was not expected until tomorrow.  I had to show them the confirmation on my phone to indicate it was their mistake and I expect to have a room.WRONG DIRECTIONS TO THE ROOM.  The girl whom checked me in has no idea what she is talking about.  She says my room in on the bottom floor and all rooms are on single level.  Wrong.  It was on the upper floor and I couldn't find it.  After 15 minutes of walking around and looking at their map, I asked 4 different employees walking around the outside about the room location.  Two gave me wrong directions and two didn't understand a word of English.  Hello, this is America.  If you work here, learn to speak the national language.FILTHY ROOM.  I took photos of the shower head, light switch dirt, shower mold, and dirty bath floor for future reference.  The style of the room is about 50 years old;  example, mirror canopy bed without the mirror on top, old CRT TV from about 1990, a door which the top lock looked life someone busted in at one time.I see a FEW 5 star reviews.  Really?  Do those reviewers work there or may be a blind person.  The average of 2 stars on Yelp is more accurate and even that is generous.I must have hit my head at least 3 times on the low hanging chandelier above the old table by the bed, and the bath ceiling was only about 6 1/2 feet high.   No convenient outlets by the bed. I had to unplug the cheap clock to power my devices.  Filthy remote control that actually had peanut butter on it.  The people cleaning these rooms are doing a terrible job, but by my experience of this industry, it is likely the management putting much pressure to clean the rooms in a short time.Old noisy wall AC / heat.I could go on, but I made my point.  You should never stay here.  This place needs to be demolished and rebuilt.In fact, I suggest not staying at ANY hotel in this area (Hotel Circle).  Even with GPS, it is much too confusing to get around this area and onto the proper freeways.",-1,1,0.486391053
372626816,"So my husband and I went for a one night stay while we were visiting family in San Diego. We didn't want to stay at a Motel 6 and we got a discount through his work. When we arrived it was late in the evening (10 p.m.) and we were greeted kindly. She asked us is we'd be needing a parking pass, as if we got there some other way. We said yes and it was going to be $20. Why would we have to pay to SELF PARK. It's not even Valet that they were offering, we had to pay to park ourselves. Super annoyed. Then she tells us there will be a hotel servicing fee as well. AND it's going to be taxed as well. When we objected she said that it says on some websites that these fees may or may not apply. Well it didn't say that when we booked our room, so how do we get them to NOT apply? No response. Whatever, we pay and drive to go park ourselves. Two booths and no one in either one. We park out car and start walking to our room and the stucco has junk and gross stuff all over. We didn't even want to touch the railings for the stair. We of course were put in the 'resort' that didn't even have an elevator to it. The exterior walls had cracks and pieces missing all throughout the stucco as well. Our bedroom was clean. As was our bathroom, towels and bed sheets. Nothing special. Our TV was a tube TV in an entertainment center, which I was surprised to even see that inside of the hotel. The bed wasn't all that comfy. Next morning we get up and check our card account and they have charged us 3x for our hotel stay. We get down there and they deny that they have anything on there accounts. We ask if we can have a receipt that shows we only checked in once? No, it can't be done.

Do not stay here if you can avoid it, if you have to, go to the hotel across the street.This &quot;Resort&quot; hotel is absolutely terrible. My friends and I stayed at this hotel for a convention in which management TRIPLE BOOKED the hotel rooms and ended up sending a large amount of people down and across the street. They were the lucky ones.If you weren't fortunate enough to stay in one of the towers where 16 rooms were flooded and were forced to relocate, then you probably ended up in one of the bungalows. The bungalows had 2 stiff doubles, a tv that was luxurious in the 90s, no amenities such as a coffee maker or fridge were offered and the art the room was decorated in looked like it belonged in a museum. At least they had free wi-fi. The convention center itself was quite spacious, however, it was a long walk (anywhere from 5-15m) away from the rooms and it's easy to get lost on the property. Unfortunately, while the rooms had wi-fi, the convention center itself does not. The only nice thing was that the restaurant nearby (Tresselies) offers delicious food.Service here is a hit or miss. They keys WILL de-magnetize quite often and depending on who you get at the reception desk, they will either be unprofessional (most likely due to being overworked and underpaid), scowling at you for daring to ask for more room keys or really happy and easy going.

12337054,"Our family converged on San Diego for a small reunion from December 27-30, 2007.  My brother, a San Diego resident, made reservations for us at the Town &amp; Country, via Expedia, months ahead of time.  He also used Expedia to pay, and to request 4 double queen rooms.At check-in, we were given four double queen rooms, but told that we would have to move to different rooms after the first night.  No explanation was given at the time, but we were told by Javier, the night manager, that the new rooms would be an upgrade, that they would be double queens, and that he would comp our three daysâ parking (parking is a hefty $14/day) and two daysâ breakfasts.Now, when I arrive at a hotel, I really want to unpack and settle in - and I donât want to worry about packing again until itâs time to leave.  I absolutely detest the unsettled feeling of staying one night here and one night there, even if itâs different rooms in the same hotel.  So Javierâs news that we would be moving after the first night was anything but welcome.  The comps were something, as was his assurance that weâd be getting better rooms, but bottom line, they werenât worth the hassle we were looking at in changing rooms.The property is huge and sprawling.  Itâs like a small community, albeit a community that never understood the point of a planning commission.  Thereâs a bit of parking here, a bit there, and even a parking structure â but we didnât see an actual entrance to that, so it didnât do us any good.  We drove to the building where our four rooms were located, and circled the surrounding area a couple of times looking for parking, but there was none within the same Zip code as the rooms; we ended up parking just this side of Tijuana.  To add to our delight, the rooms were on the second floor of a somewhat ratty old building, with no elevator, so once we humped our bags from the car to the building, we hauled them up an outdoor concrete staircase.  It was starting to dawn on us that this was not so much a hotel, as a motel with pretensions.The rooms were small, a bit shabby, and one had a funny smell that gave my daughter a headache within seconds of entering, but they were non-smoking double queen rooms, and all four of our rooms were in the same small cell-block, er, building.  The room design was a bit odd; I didnât even find the closet for several hours.  (Note: in my defense, I didnât actually spend those hours searching for a closet.  When I didnât spot one right off the bat, I just assumed there wasnât one, and was therefore surprised to discover one later, sort of tucked behind the sink.)  There was no point in unpacking, but there was not sufficient space to accommodate an open suitcase, as we were being thrown out the next morning anyway.  We finally cleared the hotelâs junk from the wooden table to put an open suitcase on it.  I awoke early the next morning, increasingly frustrated at how we were being treated.  In particular, it kept going through my mind that the only reason for moving us from our block of four rooms was that the hotel was more interested in accommodating the new guests than in making our group happy.  At around 6, I got dressed and ventured to the lobby to see if they could do any better for us.  I spoke with Christina at the desk.  On a map, she showed me where our new rooms would be, circling an area encompassing multiple buildings, while she tried to sound like the rooms were somehow close together.  She, too, assured me that we would have double queen rooms.  I mentioned the lack of convenient parking, and she pointed out a number of parking lots around the periphery of the property.  Perhaps there were parking spaces in those far-flung lots; perhaps there are parking spaces on the moon, too, but they wouldnât do us much good, being nowhere near our rooms.  Anyway, Christina said that they would make the move as hassle-free as they could, and we at least wouldnât have to wait through the check-in line again.After packing what little weâd bothered to unpack, we had breakfast at the buffet at the Terraces.  It was a typical breakfast buffet, with scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, etc.  Nothing special (e.g., no omelet bar), but it was OK.  A couple of notes to remember: if you like to enjoy a beverage with your meal, order it before you visit the buffet; otherwise, it will arrive about the time you leave.  Also, the nearest restrooms are located in the convention center (i.e., nowhere in the Terraces building), so plan accordingly.We checked out of our rooms (we had to go to the desk for this: for some reason, they couldnât just transfer the account information without seeing our by-now snarling faces), and we checked our bags with the bell desk.After spending the day out, we came back to check in to the new rooms.  Not only did they need to see our faces, but they needed to see our IDâs in order to do this, so we had to have one representative from each room turn up, with ID, at the desk.  No idea why.  The funny thing was, they enforced this ID thing with some of our rooms, but not all.  They did have our keys all ready, and we trooped off to the new four rooms, which were located, respectively, here, over there, way over there, and way the hell over there.  Thanks ever so much for the effort, Christina.The new rooms were, indeed, nicer.  They were on the ground floor and were larger.  However, each had a just one king-size bed, despite the assurances of both Javier-the-night-manager and Christina-the-morning-desk-person that weâd have double queens.  So as soon as we looked at the first room, we called the front desk to see what was up.This time, the story was different.  The person on the line said that she had no idea why Javier and Christina had both promised double queen rooms; according to her, both Javier and Christina should have known, at the time they were making their promises, that no such rooms would be available to us.  Now, if we wanted to move again the next day (call the Guinness Book of Records â three rooms in three days!), they could accommodate us.  The bottom line was, we now had four rooms, each with a king bed in it, and, as the hotel had nothing more appropriate to offer us, we requested rollaways to be brought in ASAP.  As it transpired, the term âASAPâ didnât mean much to the staff â they brought them at such a leisurely pace that we left for dinner not knowing whether there would be adequate bedding when we got back that night.  In fact, one granddaughter ended up in tears, as Grandma had to cancel a planned sleepover because she didnât know whether there would be another bed in her room.By then, I was really getting mad.  I told the person on the phone that they should be looking at comping rooms at this point.  She said they couldnât, as the reservations were made via Expedia â and that our requests for double queens were only requests, and did not have to be honored, since they, too, had been made via Expedia.  My pointing out that two hotel employees, one of them a manager, had promised double queens, didnât make a dent.  (Note to self: Self, in future, never book a hotel via Expedia; maybe use it to search, but book via the hotel directly.)The new rooms were pretty, but noisy.  Each had a nice big bay window, which, I think, was the reason why anyone walking by, conversing in normal tones, sounded like they were right in our room, conversing via megaphones.  Also, the shower head was mounted so low that, even though Iâm only 5â5â, I had to kneel to wash my hair.  (And no, it wasnât like that in order to accommodate folks with disabilities â if that were the reason, there would have been handrails.  It was just mounted at a stupid height.)Now, to be fair, I must say that they did supply some of those little extras that really make a trip memorable.  For instance, one of our four rooms came complete with a dirty diaper; it was on top of the armoire, along with the rest of the trash left by the previous occupants.  And another room had a little touch of the beach in it: sand all over the tub.  Given that a rinse was all it took to clean out the sand, it was clear that the maids had not bothered to rinse the tub, let alone properly clean it, even between guests.  Glad I opted for a shower.The bottom line here is that the Town &amp; Country is woefully mismanaged, and staffed by folks who will look you in the eye, smile, and lie their guts out.  The cleaning crew couldnât get a job mucking out a pig sty.  There are thousands and thousands of hotel rooms on Hotel Circle in San Diego; if the only vacancies are at the Town &amp; Countryâ¦well, try another city.  San Franciscoâs nice.",-1,6,0.423811724
626570151,"This was the 4th conference I've attended here over the years and each one has been horrible. Upon check-in, I was given a room on the first floor. As a solo woman business traveler, I don't do rooms on the first floor. When I asked for another room and explained why, the guy gave me a hassle and actually said, &quot;Well, at this place, women want the first floor so they don't have to carry their bags up the stairs.&quot; Um. OK. Well, I don't mind carrying my bag. I do mind staying on the first floor. The room felt like a highway motel from 1988. Exactly how I remember my rooms from previous stays. I also had to kill several ants. The curtains were broken, so it was hard to get any privacy since people were constantly walking by the room. The alarm clock wasn't plugged in. There was no desk to work, nor was there any pen or paper or a book describing the area or where I can eat. The only things in the room were old, musty furniture. The sink didn't drain well and the faucet was filthy with a little mold. In addition, the water tasted horrible. The hair dryer also didn't work. The walls were paper thin, forcing me to listen to my neighbor's conversations. Besides breakfast, the conference food was awful (it's hard to screw up eggs). Who serves a carne asada wrap cold? They also whisked the food AND the coffee/hot water away very quickly. They least they could have done was left the coffee and hot water!I also ate dinner at the only restaurant on the property, which had only about 5 things to choose from. The burger was burned to a crisp and tasted like burnt char. I had better food at the airport. On the positive, the bed was comfy. The shower was OK, even though the water pressure wasn't great. The towels were nice and thick, but too small (when wrapped around me, it barely covered my butt).I honestly don't know why any organization would host an event there.

There were four of us in the room (two were children) and we barely fit into this tiny room, with no place to put luggage except on the floor.What broke the camel's back was the excessive noise of people walking by our room late at night, going up and down the outdoor stairway that literally shook the room and awoke me from my sleep each time. The primary reason for a room is for sleep, but that was impossible.  The fact that a resort puts guests in these sub-par rooms is inexcusable. I will state that the front desk staff were polite upon check-in and check-out. I heard that the renovated tower rooms are wonderful. Unfortunately, we did not get one of those rooms and none were available during my late-night inquiry.  I suppose you have to pay up, and I was willing to do so, but none were available or could be guaranteed for the following three nights. Regardless, the look and feel of this property is clearly 1960's, maybe 1970's, and may only be appreciated by those who want to travel the nostalgic road down a very old memory lane. I have stayed at many motel and hotel properties from every rating category throughout the United States, and only a few have been on par or worse than this room. The food in the also-dated Terrace Cafe was actually quite good. My party had the sandwiches and they were all fresh and tasty.  It's too bad the quality of the food doesn't match the quality of the hotel property where one sleeps and strolls about.  What this property needs is not just a renovation of the rooms, but some serious upgrades to the remaining rooms and a good pressure washing of the entire property. Dirt that was embedded along the handrails, outside walls, old outdoor furniture, etc.  This is most unacceptable and makes one wonder how clean everything else is behind the view of its guests. Unfortunately, this was my first and last time staying at this property regardless of any renovations made in the future.

528276025,"I arrived at the Town and Country on September 27, 2017 at 6:30 Pm for a conference at the hotel the next day. The lobby was outdated, but I was greeted with a smile by the young lady on duty. She started to discuss the cost of parking and the resort fee when she told me my group had a reduced rate. I asked if I could get that lower rate and was told I missed the opportunity when I booked my room. So, I would pay the much higher rate. Also, I was presented with a page of disclosures that I had to review and initial. I felt like I was buying a car vs coming to a resort.Th room (3622) was small and like other reviews mention it smelled musty. While putting cloths in a drawer I found a plate of partially eaten food. I placed that outside. When I walked into the bathroom I found a long hair on the bathroom tub. Cleaned that also. So apparently there is a reason for the smells.The bathroom was very small and outdated.The room furnishings were old, the bed lacked a cover (Sheet with thin blanket) which turned out to be a blessing since the room was warm and the wall AC unit was struggling. The warm room made sleeping difficult and the hard-uncomfortable bed didnât help. There were minor cosmetic flaws to the room that should have been fixed. It was obvious the owners are not using the resort or parking fee to keep the rooms up. The room lacked a desk, proper lighting, additional plugs or USB power ports so business people like myself will be disappointed. The conference building was outdated and didnât appear to have received any work on it for decades. Despite that I found the meetings useful.As others have mentioned the grounds are expansive and you have plenty of room to walk. I found areas with beautiful roses and nearby a planter bed with decorative rocks partially completed. Inconsistencyâs abound. When I walked by some employees I was ignored. Not a big deal, but you would think that with an older, outdated and unkempt property as an employee you can be more outgoing to the customer. One explanation was I heard an employee complain the following week they had few hours due to a lack of customers. Low morale.The location is central and very convenient. Overall the owners need to spend some money to complete an overhaul of this hotel. Other reviews I read mentioned they are renovating. I didnât see any evidence of that occurring during my stay.

234775052,"The Town and Country Resort and Convention Center has some beautiful grounds and swimming pools but the rooms and management are something else. We were there with about 400 others for a convention.  I made my reservation directly with the hotel about five months in advance for a room in the Royal Palm Tower; the convention price was $109 per night for the seven nights.  When we arrived we were told the property had been recently sold and new management had taken over.  The price for a tower room would now be an additional $60 per night because it was now considered a &quot;premium&quot; room.  I protested to no avail and took the &quot;premium&quot; room because I had been told the bungalow rooms were very small.   The &quot;premium&quot; room had a sliding glass balcony door off its track, a TV cabinet door with a bad hinge that would not stay open and had to be propped open to view the TV, a missed-matched coffee maker and pot, (the coffee over-flowed the coffee basket on to the counter and not into the pot), a 50's style hair dryer that would not work, a plugged toilet, a wad of long black hair on the shower wall that was wiped up from the bottom of the tub, several burned-out light bulbs, only one hand towel in the bath room, and well worn/scared furniture and dirty carpet.  Mind you now that this building had reportedly been recently renovated but the water stained wall paper in the bath room and the condition of the furniture told a different story.  To their credit, whenever I reported a problem with the room, management had it fixed rather quickly. The hotel hosted a one hour get-together with hot hors d'oeuvres but the food ran out in twenty minutes. The breakfast room was poorly prepared for a large group of guests and under staffed.  It was if they were never told that the hotel was booked to near capacity.  The convention facilities were spacious and clean.

230123276,"Need I say more?  It is hard to believe that this present day dump of a hotel (nay... motel) was once an acceptable choice to lodge in San Diego.  The &quot;glory&quot; days have long since passed for this self-proclaimed resort, with nothing more than out-dated [insert ANY food/lodging/hospitality related noun here] left for us to find comfort in.Well, I can look past the tacky furniture, cheap bedding, decaying buildings, lack of room service, lack of quality food (although there was a stale cheese goldfish, along with other interesting items, trapped in an inch thick layer of dust behind the nightstand... mmm, mmm, good!!), and overall miserable environment, but I cannot look past the fact that there was AN ACTIVE BLOOM of BLACK MOLD in the bathroom.Being that I have currently a compromised immune system, I found it quite important to inform the staff about this issue.  I explained my situation to the agent on duty and expected, not to break the bank, but to be taken seriously. I was given an unapologetic and robotic response while he typed away on his computer. I then asked for some form of compensation for such a major oversight on their part.  His response was to offer me a full refund of ONE NIGHT'S (out of three) resort fee!  RESORT FEE?!?!?  ONE NIGHT?!?!?  $15?!?!? HA!!!   Must have been a joke; just like the rest of the disaster that is The Town and Country.This ship is sinking quickly!

229869824,"I'm staying here right now and I wish I wasn't. I'm here for a seminar and I like to stay at the hotel where the actual event is if at all possible. Well...this place is awful.I asked for a second floor room and didn't get it. Instead they put me on the first floor in the older section. I could get a room on an upper floor in one of their new sections but turned that down because I just didn't feel like paying anymore money.The carpet in my room is so skanky I don't want to take my shoes off. Its totally filthy.As far as amenities go...the room doesn't have a hair dryer and I didn't bring one because every place I've stayed at the last...I don't 15 to 20 years has had one.  It wouldn't be a big deal if I wasn't here for a seminar that I'm speaking at. The physical property is very big and the signage is very awful. Yes, they give you a map but the signage is just so bad the map doesn't help. The room numbers are so tiny they're hard to read as you walk past the buildings. The lighting is really bad...so at night, after you've had a long day and you're bleary eyed, you wander aimlessly trying to find the building where your room is. And again the signage is just so awful it's no help whatsoever.When I got here I ran into someone I know who was attending the seminar. He had gotten in much earlier and went to one of the restaurants for a burger. He said it was bad.The employees are almost no help. I was trying to make my way back to the lobby and asked an employee where it was. He waved in a direction, said &quot;it's over there&quot; and kept walking. I can understand he had some place to go but I'm a customer!The public restrooms in the convention space were clean, so that's a plus.The meeting room was beyond freezing but you can never get those rooms at a normal temperature.There are a couple of pools here and they look nice.Can you tell I'm trying to find SOMETHING nice to say about this place?

224176212,"So, It's Aug. 2014. We booked our rooms in November for a convention. When we arrived, they'd given our rooms away- not just us but the 60 other guests that were in line as well. What's the point of booking early if you're not getting what you reserved. Besides that, the staff is ambivalent and rude. I flew 3000 miles for this??I can see a Marriott from my room...should've stayed there. Other convention guests had to stay at a few neighboring hotels and they're glad they did.This hotel sucks.",-1,2,0.435714286
224131775,"...so I might as well list them as I can think of them.1. Poor check in experience. I had to wait 15+ minutes to check-in because there was only one clerk for this large property, and that clerk was trying to reassure another guest who had a dispute over his bill. Had another clerk not finally come out, it could have been over an hour (see next paragraph). I had just come from a multi-state road trip and all I wanted to do is go to my room, put my stuff away, and go to bed. 2. Room keys were unreliable at beginning of stay. My room was in a tower at the diagonally opposite corner of this property which is the size of a couple of city blocks. I get there and the keys kinda worked the first time, but because of a lack of luggage carts (to be mentioned later) I had to make multiple trips to the car. On my return trip, my friend and I have been locked out. So back to the desk again, on the other side of the property, where we got new keys after another lengthy wait because the first clerk was STILL dealing with the customer with the billing issue. The new keys were also flaky and only worked if you slowly inserted them and slowly removed them. As we had more stuff in the car to remove, I told my friend to stay in the room lest we be locked out again. The lock was changed out the next morning but I didn't know that until after I returned from my conference classes, so back to the front desk again...3. Lack of luggage carts. We were told at the first conference luncheon that the reason there were no luggage carts was because kids were playing with them and even throwing them into the San Diego River behind the hotel. Well, that doesn't seem to be an issue with other hotels....they either keep a better eye on their property, or simply accept the vandalism as a part of life. We were told to take advantage of the hotel's free bellhop service...which I was not offered when I checked-in. And even if I did, the bellhops were not in the lobby (presuming they were out helping someone else) so yet another wait.4. Overall shabby condition of the hotel. Conference attendees were allegedly promised the most recently-renovated rooms. While our room in the Regency Tower had newer, unstained carpeting and bamboo floors, the wallpaper was peeling in places and had poorly-patched sections. The hallway and room windows were filthy and the hallway carpeting did not appear to have been vacuumed in over a week. A pile of dishes from the room service of the room across the hall sat in the hall for over 48 hours. My A/C only worked if turned on full blast because per the technician sent to my room &quot;it doesn't work between 68 and 72 degrees&quot; so it's either freeze or swelter in the humidity. There was a nice rust stain on the tub below the faucet. Other parts of the hotel remind me of those run-down hotels in Hawaii from the 60's and 70's that had seen better days, like creaky elevators and an overall &quot;beat up&quot; looking appearance. It's an excellent candidate for the Travel Channel's &quot;Hotel Impossible&quot; series.5. Poor and/or overpriced amenities. For the conference we were not charged the resort fee, but even without it I thought this hotel was a poor value for money. The hotel's WiFi is extremely iffy and does not work at all in the conference areas. This was a complaint as well by other conference attendees and instructors. I had to print out two pages of an email as it contained tickets for an event my friend and I were going to, and by the time I paid for the computer rental fee and the per-page fee it cost me nearly $10. I didn't bother with the restaurants after seeing the prices on the menus. Attendees for my conference were only charged $1/day for parking, otherwise it's $14 and it's still a long walk due to the size of the property.6. Poor last-day experience. The day before I was due to check-out, I called the front desk and asked about late-check out, as I still had a class that morning and I didn't want to leave my belongings in the car. I was told for $35 I could check out at 1:30 PM instead of noon, and I told them I would do that. On my way back from dinner, I stopped by the desk to confirm that I am allowed late check-out. I was told at that time that the $35 fee allowed me to check out at 3 PM, not 1:30, and again confirmed my room was slated for late check-out. Yet, I found myself locked out of my room at 1 PM that day. The maid nearby called her supervisor, but because the maid totally mispronounced the name on my driver's license (to confirm I rented that room), the supervisor claimed that she doesn't see that name associated with that room. After I admittedly raised the tone of my voice to express my irritation with this latest addition to my overall bad experience at this hotel, the supervisor finally allowed me into my own room so I can check out and never come back.Once that was settled, I had 30 minute wait in a sweltering hot lobby full of people. Many clerks on duty, but simply overwhelmed. I asked about express checkout and the clerk told me that while I could check out via the TV (which was never mentioned to me before), &quot;it sometimes doesn't work.&quot; How about sliding the bill under the door with all the charges like other hotels do? That way you only need to visit the desk if there is a billing issue.All week, including the last day, I had been in contact with Senior Conference Services Manager Felipe Ortiz, who first heard of my horrible first night's experience via my complaint to the association whose conference I was attending. While some of the issues were addressed (cleanliness of the hallway, door lock being eventually replaced), others (filthy windows, A/C that only works full blast, crappy WiFi) were not. After I complained to him about the debacle over late check-out, the only thing he was able to offer me for my poor experience at this hotel was to not charge me the $35 late fee. His reply to the WiFi issue was to refer me to a technical support number. Felipe, it's not a technical support issue...your property needs to buy additional bandwidth and install more wireless access points, particularly in the conference areas.",-1,3,0.507137578

492565251,"After requesting a handicap accessible room three months , upon our arrival we were directed to a room that was across the campus and was an upstairs room, with no elevator.  We trekked all the way back to the office only to be treated very rudely by two different people at the front desk.  After a 20 minute wait, we were finally given the keys to a ground floor room.  It was very dated and not super clean, but we overlooked that.  Until that evening at about 9pm, when the shower started gurgling.  It was then that we discovered that raw sewage had been gurgling up through the shower drain and began flooding the bathroom, as it was a handicap shower and level with the floor. For the next 3 hours we sat outside as the roto-rooter guys tried to fix it. It was the most horrible hotel experience I have ever had...in my 40+ adult years of traveling. I have never been treated so rudely by multiple staff even after the raw sewage ordeal.  They finally moved us to another room the next day, but no attempt was made to be hospitable in any way.  The fact that they didn't charge us for the night that our room was unavailable to us because of the raw sewage is no compensation...because we couldn't use it! I was very sad because I have been to this place many time throughout the past 40-50 years and it was beautiful, especially the grounds.

We get to the room and obviously we are in the section that has yet to be renovated. The decor is dated, the TV is the same one I had in the house in the mid-80s and there is a faint but noticeable stale smell in the air. The smell prompted me to look up at the air vent, a visual I wish I could take back - it was caked with dirt and likely hadn't been wiped down in months. The bathroom was tiny, the water pressure sad, and it took forever to get hot water. We were exhausted though so we changed and dropped into bed. This was the only thing the hotel got right - the bed was super comfy, and quite honestly was the best part of the stay. We had the pleasure of being rudely awoken by maintenance at 6am Saturday morning as they were scraping chairs outside our front door and having loud discussions about their day. When my husband opened the door to say something to them, they seemed surprised at his annoyance. It was then we discovered any talking, any noise, no matter how loud or soft, can be heard thru the walls and window of the room. (I won't go into the details of the couple next door. You're welcome) We had a full Saturday planned so we just got up and went, expecting to only come back and crash for the night before coming home this afternoon (Sunday). We arrived back to the hotel around 10:30, had another parking adventure, and were less than thrilled to find a group of people sitting in the chairs outside our room drinking and laughing and enjoying themselves TOO loudly. We turned the TV on (volume up to drown them out, but unfortunately. reception was awful - almost all channels were snowy. Likely a bad splitter or connector, but just proves these non-renovated rooms are in dire need of bottom up attention) and attempted to get a decent nightâs sleep - which worked great until 11:45 when they noise level woke us both up. My husband opened the door to say something but another guest beat him to it, and while it didn't break the party up, they at least quieted down some.

170752818,"Within the last month, my wife and I have stayed at both the Sheraton and the Town and Country that are located on Hotel Circle in San Diego.  Both are within a few blocks of one another and have similar rates.  However, both stays were nowhere near the same when it comes to quality. I will list each area of both stays in order to paint a picture of this so called &quot;resort hotel&quot;.1. Check InAt the Sheraton, my wife and I were greeted by friendly hotel staff, freshly made cookies, and some refreshing cucumber water, and were checked in within minutes of entering the door. We were also given the choice of what kind of view we wanted, city or hillside.At the Town and Country, we were greeted with a line that wrapped around the inside of the lobby and took 45 minutes to get through and then weren't even told where our room was.2. Room Location/AppealSheraton - The room was located on the twelfth floor and smelt very clean with a modern interior, and glass windows that overlooked a good portion of the city. IT resemble pictures that we had seen prior to visiting the hotel.  It had what appeared to be a 37-42&quot; HD TV and a small refrigerator.  The room wasn't huge, but easily accommodated my wife and I and the bathroom was laid out so that it wasn't very cramped to have both of us in at the same time.  It was very peaceful and we had no interruptions.Town and Country - The hotel itself is laid out as though it is a small town, with two hotel towers, a spa, 3 restaurants and a bar, 3 pools, and several smaller condo-like strips of hotel rooms. However, the awe inspiring layout of this hotel was short-lived as we found out that our room was street level in one of the condo like strips of rooms. The room smelt moldy and looked as though all of the furniture had been purchased on sale from a second hand store, nothing like any of the pictures. The room and bathroom were incredibly small and nowhere near big enough to fit 2 people comfortably.  The TV was a non HD CRT TV from the 90's with bad reception and there was no refrigerator. Our room was located near one of the small streets that intertwine the hotel, and all night we heard cars revving their engines, horns honking, and people laughing and yelling outside our window.3. Amenities/DiningSheraton - Upon checking in, my wife and I were presented with 2 breakfast vouchers for the on-site restaurant, which totaled $30, and the breakfast was AMAZING.  Our parking was comped, our WIFI was comped, and the fitness center didn't cost anything to go to.  Also, we were presented with 2 FREE bottles of water every day in our room.Town and Country - Everything at this hotel costs money!!! The parking was $8 per night, the WIFI was $7.99 per 24 hours, and the half bottle of water located in the room was $1. The only saving grace for this entire trip was the on-site dining. The restaurant, Trellises, was nicely decorated, and was separated into a bar on one side and a restaurant on the other. The staff on the restaurant side of were all very professional and gave great service. On the bar side, however, one of the bartenders and what sounded like a waitress kept audibly laughing and yelling at one another throughout our entire meal. The fitness center that is located on site is one of the better looking hotel gyms that I have seen, however, it costs $5 per person per day in order to use the facility.4.

I ordered a salad with my meal and they forgot my dressing and my glass of ice water. By the time they brought them up, an hour had gone by. Needless to say I was tired and no longer in the mood for salad. The decor is very dated in both the rooms and the restaurants. The food was &quot;OK&quot; so I wouldn't say it was terrible.

219444011,"I will start by addressing the things I liked about this hotel.  The grounds are very nice - the flowers are lovely, the trees lush, the staff clearly takes great pride in this aspect of the hotel.It is also a very short walk to a shopping mall with very nice retail, as well as the 'Green Line' train which for $5 a day you can ride back and forth to downtown.However, the room I had was in one of the high rise towers (I don't know the condition of the other cabana style rooms) and I am fairly confident that they have not replaced anything in the last thirty years.  While the linens were clean, the floors were old, stained and smelled very musty. This included the hallway and elevator.  Also, the breakfast (I ordered the buffet) was very over priced for what was offered.  Perhaps the menu was the way to go.  I may never know.The entire place is quite the compound.  I was staying for a conference downtown and this was the only room left on the block they had set aside, but there was another conference at the T&amp;C.  I couldn't tell you the number of people wandering around lost, trying to figure out which lush, well maintained walking path to take to get to where ever they were going.  It was comical.There are signs and maps set up 'mall style' to help you find your way, but they often proved ineffective as the &quot;You Are Here&quot; dot was mostly missing.My advise?  Book your conference attendance early, stay downtown at a more modern and convenient hotel.  If your conference is at the T&amp;C, well, good luck and bring flip flops so you don't have to walk barefoot in your room.",-1,1,0.485679012

I was charged $19.32 in taxes and fees by priceline.com. Town and Country Resort charged me ad additional $29.75 in taxes and fees when I checked out. The $29.75 in taxes and fees are $14 for parking charge, $14 hotel services fee leisure, $1.47 occupancy tax, $0.28 SD tourism mktg district assessment. What a scam.

We wanted to visit some of the beaches and as we are 3 hour drive from home we thought we could find a good rate for one night.  Pricelined a Fri. night stay in the summer for $101 (not including taxes/fees).  We got hit with a $14 parking fee and a $14 Resort fee upon check in.  The staff seemed to know that this would be a big deal and I wasn't the only one who felt cheated!  In the 15 minutes that it took to check in I noticed at least 4 other priceline customers checking in.  They were able to accommodate our double bed request -- so that was good. The &quot;resort&quot; has 3 pools but only the main one in the center is heated!  My kiddos enjoyed it even after spending a whole day at the beach. NO lifeguard, and the gates surrounding the pool were not locked or secure in anyway.  There snack bar was WAY overpriced but will do in a pinch.  Rooms had no fridge or microwave, but did have a coffemaker. The room was very dated and had that OLD smoking room smell.   The AC was very good.  Turned that sucker on and froze a bit but it helped with the smell.  Overall it wasn't a bad hotel... but when they sneak a fee on you like that it makes you very WEARY to say the least.

Upon entering the building we waited over 20 minutes for the elevator because one was down. The hallways were covered with filth ( including gum, toilet paper, trash, etc.) They looked like they were never cleaned! Lights in the hallway were blinking on and off. A small child looked at us in the elevator and said &quot;these rooms are disgusting&quot;.  We entered our room and it was filled with cigarette smoke, dark, dirty ( either a thumb print of blood or ketchup on our wall). We immediatly called the front desk and were told &quot; there is nothing we can do, we are oversold tonight). Why a hotel would oversell is beyond me, but upon insisting to talk to a manager, a room magically opened up. The next room was a &quot;suite&quot; that included a couch, but no bed. Once of us slept on the couch and the other on a cot. The next day we were promised the room we had orgainally requested in a renovated building. The room was not cleaned in time ( after 3:30 pm) despite being promised it would be ready by 12:00 ( we were driving around all day with our computers, etc. in the car) so we were put into &quot;their best room&quot;. That was a joke. This room had outdated decor and peeling paint. We asked to move again and we're put into a room that looked okay ( a relative okay by this point). That night we woke up to our neighboor jiggling the door between the rooms. The door was so thin that his light was shining through all night ( like a giant night light) and could hear him eating chips!!!!! No sound proofing! Worst of all, our beds felt cold and wet. We realized the a/c was pumping out cold wet air. The comforter was wet, the curtains were wet, our clothes were wet. The next day we checked out and found a much much nicer hotel in Old Town. We were concerned for our health at that point due to the poor air quality.  Many people at our confrence felt the same way about the rooms. While the grounds here are pretty, they are not clean. There was trash all over at 7:00 am. Cups, beer cans, etc. left out all night. Elevators were disgusting and front desk staff seems trained to lie. We were told so many mistruths in our short 48 hour stay. After 4 rooms in 48 hours, we had to give up. In addition, people spotted rats running across walkways.

The hotel was built around the 1950's and then updated to meet &quot;modern&quot; 1990's style decor. There were many items showing age etc. rotten wood overhangs. The compound map was inaccurate and difficult to use. The hotel landscaping and exterior sitting areas were very nice and the exterior pools looked well kept, but I did not use due to temps. Impressive layout once you get used to it. The meeting rooms were okay but the Wifi was not strong.The beds are very aged and sink to one side or another.They are scheduled to rebuild it in the next year or two. I would wait for that before I would consider returning.

The dark blue carpet, dark wood furniture and the cinder block construction took me back to the days when I would be sleeing in on that blue carpet with my brother. If you wanted to wear your liesure suit and gold medalion you would fit right in. Someone told me that they intentionally kept the decor like this as some sort of retro Chic thing. I doubt it. I will say that the sheets were clean, the towels were clean and good quality and the room overall was clean and well kept. there was a funny smell like old cardboard or particle board in part of the room but nothing too horrible.These sort of places love to tell you how everything you need is right there on the property so you never need to go anywhere. And, if you like mediocre food, over-priced souvenirs and horrible, slow, awful , bad service then they are right. We ate at several restaurants on the property and the service was invariable slow and not particulary friendly. But that may just be because it was California. The food however was always mediocre at best and lousy was a more common adjective. There is only one reason you should stay here.

421906641,"I will start off by saying that this property has great potential, with different management, and approach to customer care.Upon arrival, it was taking them 15 - 20 minutes a person to check in.  And only two staff people at the counter.  They were not pleasant, and offered no apologies for the long lines and delays. After securing my room, I had to lug all of my luggage (no help from the bellmen, and this is a large property!) to my room.  I had a horrible time finding the room.  Signs were mis-posted, and elevators were blocked off.  Needless to say, my room was about as far as you could get from the Registration.My room was right in the middle of the construction.  During the evening of my second night there, a gas/odor started to come through the AC vent.  After calling the front desk, and no one showing up, obviously the odor got worse.  I called again, no answer. Guess what? I passed out!  When I came to, i crawled out of the room, after grabbing my cell phone and alerted a friend, who called 911.  I tried calling the front desk again.  I was brushed off, because they said 911 was calling them. By this time, I was sitting on the ground outside of my room, with the door shut behind me.An hour had gone by, and Paramedics were at my room before anyone from the hotel showed up.  When the door was opened, people could smell the gas/vapors.  I was taken to the hospital where I stayed until 3:00 am, when my vitals returned to normal.Once back at the hotel, i struggled to get back in the hotel, as the had signs improperly marked, so people could not enter the hotel.  I spoke to the front desk person, and was basically accused of lying.  Vapors could never come from their AC Vents!  HA!!! After more wasted time trying to get into the room by security to get needed things, (I was changing rooms), I was then victimized by the Security Guard.  By this time, I wanted OUT!I was at a conference, and visited next morning with the conference people.  With their support, we went and visited some management at the hotel.  While they said things that of course you wanted to hear, I really believed that was not the case.They paid for  a nights lodging, and one night of room service for my inconvenience.  I was moved to a smaller room, different bedding (downgraded) because the hotel was full.  No offer in adjusting the price for that inconvenience!  Also, no offer was made to cover my hospital bill or ambulance ride.  They are going to get that bill!!!Once moved, I don't believe my new room ever made it on the maid list, as my room was not cleaned while I was there.  I also did not have any drinking cups/glasses in my room.  Though I requested them, they were never brought.  Also, my dirty dishes from room service were never picked up, even though I contacted them, left a note on them (housekeeping had to come in to see it though), and I had to work around them.The elevators were a joke!  The Construction crews were supposed to use the middle one.  I believe they used every one BUT the middle one (which was off limits to guests).  Guests had to squeeze in past broken wood, plaster, dirt, CRUD, dirty rude workers, just to get in.  Most of the time, the elevators were full of construction stuff, or SHUT OFF at certain floors by the construction crews, so guest could not use them!  Stairwells were blocked off (fire escape routes) for painting, etc.  Being on the 9th floor, this made me uneasy!!!I urge anyone who is a Conference Planner to seriously think twice, a third time, and then even a 4th time about ever using this property!  It should be condemned until management and staff are taught properly how to serve customers/guests.

Because a good fire is what this place needs!Stayed here the night of January 15th after a twenty-five year break since my last stay and I must say nothing has changed. While I was scheduled to stay for two nights, I left after one.This place is so run down and dirty I can think of only two reasons why anyone would want to stay here: 1. You think this place charges cheap room rates and you are trying to save a buck; 2. you secretly yearn for the 1950's and care nothing for modernity, cleanliness, or the amenities that a real hotel can bring.First, try and find your room. I dare you! Even with the provided map. When I was on my way to my room, I ran into two others that were dumbfounded on how to find their rooms. Once found, the elevators wouldn't work properly. The hallways lacked proper lighting (or lighting that flickered---this was also the case in my room), and a dusty odor permeated the hallway.Time to eat? Trellises is a joke. I waited for fifteen minutes in a restaurant that was almost empty before someone said, &quot;can I help you?&quot; I left. So I saw a sign with an arrow pointing to a steakhouse. Hmmm, this might be worth a try. This is the Town &amp; Country's way of messing with your mind. There is no steakhouse!!The good news? The front desk staff is nice. That's it. That's all you get.Oh. The place is changing hands and will soon be torn down and undergo a remodel. Until that is complete my advice is to STAY AWAY!I know. You'll look at some reviews and see an &quot;excellent&quot; rating (not sure what that's about. Could be those people have never been in a four or five star hotel or resort) and you'll wonder how anyplace can be so bad. You'll be hooked. They will have snookered you in. Can't help that.

291085276,"We booked 3 rooms at this hotel, we specifically requested the &quot;renovated&quot; rooms.  My son's family arrived right at 3:00pm.  He told the desk that we would be late, but he secured the other rooms with a credit card.  He requested a refrigerator because he had milk and medicine that need refrigeration.  It took 4 hours and two visits to the lobby and multiple phone calls to the desk for the refrigerator to be delivered.  At least the ice machine worked.  When we arrived about 12:30 am, we were told that our rooms in the &quot;renovated&quot; tower had been given away and that we were being given rooms in an annex.  When we arrived at the &quot;annex&quot; I was horrified.  One elevator did not work and the other was so small only two people could use it at a time.  It creaked dreadfully.  If we were not on an upper floor, I would have carried my luggage up the stairs.  The facility was &quot;shabby&quot;.  We arrived at our rooms about 1:00 in the morning.  I went to my room and the key did not work.  I checked the key envelope where the clerk wrote the room number and it was correct.  I called the desk and was told a bell man was on the way with a new key.  I sat in the hallway for about 20 minutes waiting and then called the front desk again.  The clerk  said that she could not find my room.  I am still not sure what that meant.  She then told me that I was actually in a different room.  I told her that I was at the room number written on my envelope and she got very snitty and said that it was the wrong room.  When we finally got in the room, the carpet was so stained I hated walking on it and the bathroom had mold in the shower.  The wallpaper was torn in multiple locations.  The desk called at 9 in the morning and offered us a room in the &quot;renovated&quot; tower.  The bell man was very timely and very nice.  The bright spot in this saga.  We moved rooms and found the &quot;renovated&quot; rooms were just as bad as the previous room.  Huge stains covering the carpet and mold in the bathroom shower.  The wallpaper was the same but it was not torn.  I needed water to take my medicine and remembered that the vending machine outside was being loaded as we walked by so I went to get some water.  I put my money in and a rigid plastic piece blocked the bottle so I could not get it out.  I called the desk and was told to come to the office, which was in another building, and they would refund my money.  I told them I needed the water and they said they would send someone to fix the machine.   No one came for quite awhile.  A maintenance man walked down the hallway so I asked him to try for me, he could not help.  He did lean over the rail and yell at the machine guy to come fix it.  Then the maid stopped by and said it had been broken for a week.  In the mean time I visited every floor and finally found a machine that worked on the 8th floor.  I went back to my room and about an hour later the maid came to get me to say that the machine guy was there.  He gave me a bottle of water and fixed the machine.  I told him that the machines on the other floors were not working either but he did not seem to care.  My daughter and her husband moved to the Marriott at the Marina after the first night and paid very little more.  They were on business and so would be in the hotel for the entire week.

It has a lot of different ammentities (and the spa fitness center is the one thing that is new and modern) but overall the property is old and tired.  One plus is that you can go for a walk or a jog thru the nearby San Diego river if you are into that.  My wife and I really enjoyed that on a Saturday morning. Another plus is that it is within walking distance of the Green Lne Tain so you can go down to the Gas Lamp Quarter and back fairly easily.  A negative is that many of the guests are there for convention type events, and depending on which group is attending, you might be sharing elevator rides with folks somewhat off the norm.

Someone has a sense of humor because there were displays of rabbits dressed in all kinds of garb (states, not real rabbits) and flamingoes. Beautiful rose bushes and succulants all around the place.  Several good restaurants and a cafÃ©.  Parking was convenient to our  tower. Check in was efficient. Staff was always pleasant.   A walk across the parking lot, over a bridge, across a road takes you to an awesome outside shopping mall.  The conference center was fine, like 'ok' fine, not super good fine.  People complained of crappy wifi but since I wasn't trying to use it during the conference I didn't notice this.  The rooms and the food served during the conference were all good.  Ok, so that's the good stuff.  Now for the room: Ick!  It was 'ok' but also substandard.  It did not smell, I was not afraid to sleep in the bed (actually I was a little but I examined the bedding and then decided I could use it) or unpack BUT the drapery was faded and stained, the wall paper behind the curtains was mildew and peeling--gross!   I could tell that the tower had some good care but the room should not have been like that.  I did fill out a survey and let them know my concerns (so hopefully this review isn't a surprise to them).  And that is that: It's dated but that is part of it's charm, the room need work!  I would attend a conference there, I would eat there, I would not stay there again.*I am having trouble with part of the review:  The Hotel Ratings buttons only click on terrible (no matter which circle I click on), and I can't seem to change it.  I did not review service as terrible and would not rate the other things as terrible so I didn't rate them.",-1,6,0.535208333
24560225,"Due to the Oklahoma State Cowboys being invited to the Holiday Bowl, we started making plans to drive to San Diego and make a three day road trip.  I found a 3 star resort on Hotwire and decided to give it a try.  When we arrived at the hotel, we found total chaos at the front counter.  We were given instructions to our room and when we opened the door, we found a king size bed with bed taking up the entire room.  Because there was 3 of us, 1 being an 11 year old, I called Town &amp; Country after I booked on Hotwire and was assured we were given a no smoking room with two beds.  We drove back up to the front counter and explained that we needed two beds and we were given a king size bed.  The employee stated since Town &amp; Country was a resort, they only guaranteed a room, not anything else.  I asked why I was told by an employee of Town &amp; Country that we were given a no smoking room with two beds.  The employee changed her story to our room being occupied by some people who wouldn't leave.  Right beside me during this exchange was a lady who was at the counter when we checked in which was about 30 minutes ago.  Turns out, she booked on Orbitz and Town &amp; Country was claiming they didn't receive the reservation.  All evidence was pointing to Town &amp; Country overbooking and now they didn't have enough rooms.  I told the employee that she was going call Hotwire and explain to them that they did not have the room that was promised.  She did call Hotwire and told the employee that I did not find the facility acceptable so the Hotwire employee asked to speak with me.  I explained the situation to Hotwire and was told they would refund the price immediately and asked to speak with the Town &amp; Country employee.  The Hotwire employee asked the Town &amp; Country employee if they were going to find alternate arrangements for us and was told no.  By this time, I had been lied to so much that I just wanted to leave and never come back.  As I was leaving, I noticed the lady who had booked through Orbitz was still there without a room.   Luckily, I had joined AAA before I left and had their California book with us.  We called several hotels in the area and eventually found a Comfort Inn Hotel &amp; Suites not far away.  This room was much nicer and larger than the room at Town &amp; Country plus parking was only $5.00 a day instead of the $14.00 charged at Town &amp; Country.  Why Town &amp; Country Resort survives is beyond me.  Worst service in the world, rooms that are no larger than a king size bed, furnishings that could be found at a flea market..  There is just no reason to stay here when there are so many other choices in the same price range.",-1,0,0.444306418

The thermostat in my room did not work When I turn the air on, it goes to 64 degrees and you cannot raise it up. You have to sign a waiver for damage, early departure, and a few more items which is not professional hotel. If a guest needs to depart early, they should be allowed without penalty. There is absolutely nothing in the area for entertainment. Plan to take the trolley to other parts of the city. This is a MOTEL by all definitions.

120556053,"I had stayed here for a business conference and was disappointed. I am EXTREMELY happy I had gotten a discount on the room, it was not worth what they ordinarily charge. First of all, this &quot;resort&quot; doesn't have anything but pools. They are all outdoors and only one is heated. The restaurants on the property are extremely expensive, which is to be expected, but the food is nothing special. I paid 9 dollars for a small plate of hash browns and coffee. One cup! There is a &quot;Starbucks&quot; in the cafe, but they were using different coffee and flavors but keeping the Starbucks prices and names. The line for the cafe went out the door and around the pool, they would only help one guest at a time and wait for their coffee to be made. Our room was extremely small with an old tv, and smelled like it was 100 years old. They need some fresh air. The nicest part of the &quot;resort&quot; is the convention area, which has been mostly renovated. The rest is a 60s flashback. There are no hallways and the whole place is motel style. You have to pay for wifi and the gym. There is no complimentary breakfast. All of the restaurants served on dirty looking cups/plates and smelled gross. Our convention had paid for breakfast, which was 25$ per person per day. I am very happy I didn't pay for it, all we got is hard sausage and watery eggs. Although the property is in bad condition, the guest service is very good. We were satisfied with the maid service and the bellhop was very good with driving us around. Although the guest service and conference went well, you can't put lipstick on a pig. I would not stay here. It is not worth your money. Needs a renovation badly.",-1,1,0.565164204

We were told by Jeremy that rooms we requested were not availiable today but that we could check into the rooms requested between 10am and 11am the next day.  We received our keys to the room.. We were not given directions but was given a map and no explanation on how parking worked. No information such as pools, restaurants, bars, etc were told to us. We arrived at the rooms which were like motel quality.  Outside the rom was dirty and unswept.  Inside was worse. The bed spread on the bed which is like a ivory color looked like it had blood on it.  It also looked like someone or a dog peed near the bed.  It was gross.  We switched to rooms upstairs which were much better.  The next day we went to check out of the old rooms and into the new room and was told we wouldn't be able to until 4pm.  I explained that wasn't what was told to us.  I was told all the rooms in the tower were being shampoo and they were waiting on them to dry.  At 2pm I received a call that the rooms were availiable.  The tower room was fantastic.  The floor was still wet.  I had already received such bad service I didn't bother to report it because that means having to drive back over to check-in for new keys. When I was in the lobby to get keys to the new rooms I heard the clerk checking someone in and explaining the parking, what restaurants were availiable and I wondered why we weren't treated like that.  We  went into the gift shop and the lady never opened her mouth to speak.  I was traveling with 4 co-workers and we are of color and I wondered if that had anything to do with the level of service received.  I never jump to that conclusion but after the gift shop, that conclusion definitely hit home. Only time I received decent customer service was from Donna at checkout. Probably happy to see us leave.  My advice. Stay elsewhere. Motel 6 will probably have better service.",-1,0,0.470878788

660635682,"This hotel fancies itself as a resort, but staff treats guests as though it remained the 40-room motel that it started as years ago.  It is on a huge property in an indifferent San Diego neighborhood, near large and noisy freeways.  (Despite reasonable sound-proofing, we could hear the roar from I-8 throughout the nights.)  We stayed two nights in a recently remodeled room on the top floor of an immensely large (wide) âtowerâ, which is a long walk from a temporary lobby on the other side of an on-site convention center.  Although there are nice palm trees and plastic flamingos, this is a minimalist âresortâ.  The pool and hot tubs are modest, equivalent to what one would find at an average Holiday Inn.   You can hardly see the pool from the tiny supposedly-poolside bar.The restaurant (the only one) is a disaster.  The grab-and-go breakfasts tastes terrible.  The dinner menu is such a joke that we didnât even have dinner at all.  The staff was completely ill-equipped to register the guests who appeared, vaguely referring to computer problems.  Staff could not respond competently to telephoned inquiries.  We asked the evening beforehand how to arrange for an airport taxi early in the morning of our departure, since it is too long a distance from the tower to the taxi zone by the temporary lobby to wheel suitcases.  We were told to call down 5 minutes before we needed a taxi and one would be sent over to the tower.   When we did that, a golf-cart appeared rather than a taxi.  The driver told us that taxis were never sent over.  By the time he got us back to the taxi stand, our taxi had been given to somebody else.The one advantage of this hotel is that it is located adjacent to a trolley station.  (âTrolleysâ in San Diego are actually an efficient system of rapid light-rail.  The network is not extensive, but you can conveniently get to some important places.)  Hotel directions said to take a pedestrian bridge over a tiny river from the tower parking lot to the station.  Unfortunately, the bridge was closed and we were told it was being taken down.  So you now have to walk a quarter-mile longer distance to get to the station.Our remodeled room was large and attractive, though rather spare.  There was an outside balcony with two comfortable chairs.  Sea gulls squawked at us from some adjacent eaves.  The bathroom shower was defective.  The price we were charged was reasonable.  But the venue has little to recommend itself.",-1,0,0.518253968

The place could use a deep cleaning. The elevators were dirty, the halls look like they have been vacuumed in weeks. The only way to get any service is by texting them. On the 2nd night stay, we came home to find a Do Not Disturb plastic thing stuck in our door. I have no idea who put that in there. Our room wasn't cleaned and we were out of coffee pods and couldn't get any from housekeeping. We ended up going to the store and buying some so we could have coffee in the morning. We wanted to use the pool and teenagers/young adults started congregating at the pool at sunset. We woke up at 2:30 in the morning on Sunday to loud noise. We went out to the balcony and watched this kid trying to open the sliding doors along the bottom floor. My husband yelled at him as to what he was doing. He said there was a party and he was trying to find the room. He was running around the place for at least an hour and we didn't know who to call. We should have called the cops.

213149506,"Stayed at this hotel this weekend (thurs, fri, sat) for a huge yearly convention.  This is a privately owned property so they don't care about anything. PARKING IS HORRIBLE. Booked the room three months ago, requested a fridge at that time, when we checked in on Thursday, no fridge in the room, were told the fridge would be sent up right away. 20 handicap parking spaces for entire &quot;resort&quot;. Had to carry 50 lbs daughter on my back for 5 blocks to get to our room. Complained to the manager Luis, and all he said was sorry. Asked for a discount for the inconvenience and he refused. TO add insult to injury, they charged the three night stay to our card TWICE. Refused to waive deposit as a courtesy. Was forced to pay deposit cash, and was STILL charged the deposit on top of that to my card.  Still, fridge didn't arrive. Difficult to find staff that speaks English. Room was dirty, no towels, sink was stopped up, maintenance called and nobody was ever sent. Friday we called again for fridge and sink, nobody sent. Screams could be heard throughout the night because we were near one of the pool. Saturday morning asked the driver of the courtesy shuttle to help us to our car (remember, I have a handicapp daughter) and he didn't speak any english. Told him in my broken spanish what I needed, and he told me to go to the lobby (which was about 7 blocks away from where i was staying). Saturday night, called maintenance again for fridge and sink, guess what? nobody arrived. Around 10pm, maintenance arrived while we were sleeping mind you, with the fridge and a snake to unclog the sink. All our food was already spoiled so fridge was not only pointless, but kind of insulting. It just seems to me like the staff here doesn't care about their patrons.

Half of the closet next to the sink was converted to a shelving unit and the refrigerator was inconveniently located on the floor of the other side of the closet.

We checked in a little early so we could visit the pool during the day, and did not want to leave the bags at the front since we did not have a parking spot for our car yet. Upon getting into the room, we noticed a strong wet smell. I put my bag down and had a seat on the bed, but I would not call it a bed. It felt like I just sat on a piece of plywood. It was as hard as a rock. All of the furniture in the room looks like it has gone through a war and back, scuffs everywhere, scrapes, and dents in EVERY piece of furniture. It really looked terrible. The room was very small, and the bathroom even smaller. The TV unit was a massive drawer/dresser thing that had room for a tv inside of the cabinet, but even though they upgraded their old box style TVs for a flat screen under 30 inches (it was very small), they just left the rest of the TV unit to be wasted. There was no refrigerator, which was very disappointing considering they call this a Resort, when I have stayed at Days Inn that have these basic things. I was appalled by the room conditions, so I called the front desk to see if we could upgrade, because we already paid for the room and did not want to deal with getting a refund. For an additional 20 dollars we got a room at one of the towers, and considered it for the best. They send a bellman to the room to help us, and he agreed that our room really was terrible. He also let us know that people complain about the comfort of THOSE beds all the time. Why would the front desk set us up with the worst room in this huge resort that people complain about all the time? Why have they not purchased new mattresses for them? This was very sub-standard, especially since they charge you a LARGE resort fee, for 32 acres of drought ridden gardens. I also asked the front desk about the shuttle they advertised upon check in. We wanted to take a stroll in little italy but when we called the front desk to inquire they said a prominent &quot;NO!&quot; and that the farthest they would go is 2 miles. What a waste.On the way to the new room we saw the pools. Very basic, lots of kids. Once we squeeze into the tiny elevators barely big enough for 5 people, we get to our floor. There was a HUGE broken glass window in the hallway, boarded up with plywood and duct tape. How are you going to have a classy place with an intimidating broken window being the first thing you see when you get off the elevator? Terrible. We arrive in our new room and notice that, once again, there is no refrigerator. I head to the ice machine, only to realize there is MOLD ALL OVER. I call the front desk and they said nothing about the mold and that a small refrigerator is at no charge to have delivered to the room. We accept and an hour and a half later a disgruntled maintenence guy shows up at our door and practically throws the tiny fridge on the ground. He rushes out of the room and proceeds on his radio call to yell at somebody at the other end of his walkie talkie. I must let you know that this newly UPgraded room had a great bed and linens, but no balcony, no caffeinated coffee (just decaf) and was just as big as the first (even though we were promised a larger room with the upgrade). The hotel next door to this (The Handlery) is by far my favorite in Hotel Circle. They have EVERYTHING. They do not skip out on customer service, pool room, refrigerators, or anything else. Their rooms are loaded, staff is courteous, and the hotel has always been quiet, so sleeping is easy there.We regretted reading other web site reviews, and because some were not bad and we felt like we were getting a deal staying here. A motel 6 would have been a better option. I cannot make up this kind of story, but only warn people that might be traveling to this area to seriously consider what kind of place advertises Gift Shops as one of their selling points.

When we arrived on Friday afternoon, each party was then asked for their personal credit card, that their rooms hadn't been paid for.  Some even had to wait 2-4 hours for their rooms to be cleaned!

When I spoke with Pisey she said that she never got the credit card information when we reserved the rooms... And my reply was simply &quot;You reserved 15 rooms without guaranteed payment&quot;?

I was told sometime later that perhaps the property sits on Indian burial ground.  The motel has refused to answer my emails.  Does anyone happen to know anything about the history of this motel, or the land it sits on?  Iâd REALLY appreciate it.  [--] is my email if you know something!  Thanks!",-1,3,0.454259259

Some parts of the resort are older and are starting to look very run down.  I hear that a major update is in store for the resort, and I will say, it's definitely needed.  In addition, the check in process was confusing, inefficient and extremely inaccurate.  Any time we needed to deal with the front desk, we could count on at least an hour in line to accomplish anything. Calling the front desk was always at least a five minute wait before the call was answered.  I'm not sure why the process is so slow because I've never spent that much time checking in to any hotel.  The rates were not what we were quoted, we were told the rooms we reserved were not available and then people behind us in line were given the rooms we wanted.  There were only two restaurants open on the resort for dinner, and one or the other seemed to be closed intermittently.  All in all, I would not recommend a stay at this resort.",-1,1,0.482004831

126294641,"I went to this hotel (would not call it a resort) for a conference and stayed there for three days.  Knowing that this place would be packed for the conference, I made a reservation 2 months ahead, thinking that I could get a better room.  When I made the reservation, I reserved a room in the Royal Palm Tower, which is supposed to be the biggest room with two quenn bed, nice view, and a balcony.  However, when I got there, although the front desk told me that I had a two-quenn bed room, when I got to my unit, I found it in a complex (not the tower that I reserved) under a stair case, no view, with two double-beds instead.  The beds were not comfortable to sleep on.  Since the place was packed with two conferences going on at the same time, I did not ask for a different room, which was a mistake.  In addition, the hot water boiler was way over the other side and it took forever just to have loop warm water.When we checked out, I mentioned to the front desk and was told that there was nothing they could do and that queen beds were available &quot;on requests only&quot;, which I thought I did.  It's not like I was asking for compensation or anything.  A heartful apology from the manager would've done it.In addition, this place did not have enough parking space to hold two conferences at the same time and we were having hard time finding parking space after we went out for lunch.The last day of the stay, we went to one of their restaurant there to get a bite before I had to go and do my presentation.  The place was full of people but only with one waitress.  We had to ask three times and it took 20 minutes before the second waitress finally showed up.  By the time the food got to our table, I had to leave for my presentation.  You would think that the management would realize that there were two conferences going on and schedule more people in those restaurants.Obviously this place only cares about the money and not the customer services.  I would not go back there again.  And if the conference is going to be held here, I would not go to that conference.  This is how much I do not like this place.",-1,0,0.506060606

They told me they didn't know who entered our room and when we asked the front desk they said they didn't know either. WOW~~ so someone was sent to my room  with no record of it! This is scarey. So back to the security interview.My daughter &quot; the ipad owner&quot; was so upset and they showed no compassion or ANY concern about our ipad being stolen. I was very concerned that someone was able to get in my room and I was told they couldn't find out who until a &quot;locksmith&quot; was available.  My gut feeling told me that this is happening here alot since no one there reacted with any shock. We then asked for a different  suite but was told there were none available. I decided to make a police report and call the police department since I could tell the hotel staff was so non concerned about this theft.So the next day saturday at noon after receiving no call from anyone we went to the front desk and asked for the general manager, and was told there is no general manager and spoke to the front desk manager.  What blows me away was when i asked for the name of the person who's her boss, she gave me the name but would NOT give me a phone number. Again  we got the &quot;nothing we can do&quot;WOW~~~ My friend received a call at 300pm from the security manager and he also would not give us the number of the Main guy. So we are almost at 24 hours and still have not received ANY help from anyone.  Just excuses and pointing the finger to someone else.  Today is thursday, and i received a phone call from the insurance stating  that since it was no force entry or anything, and the mainten. dept  guy was a 15 year veteran and &quot; wouldn&quot;t do it &quot; that  i have no claim. My comment to her was ~if  its not the hotel employee,but he was the only one other then us to be in the room mmmmmmm. I asked  did he leave the door open so someone else could come in and take it????  because my daughters ipad was stolen.  Its either by him or someone he let in or he left my door open.the lady said, &quot;How do we know you had one?&quot; OMG are you kidding me, First of  all they have not even reviewed the police report and they told me it did not matter. FYI,  the dumb thief left a half drank bottle of water in the room next to our luggage that the police were given as evidence, as well as some other info, that can be reviewed in the police report regarding a tracking system!!   I am aware that no hotel would want to admit fault because that would open then up for numerous issues, BUT this whole situation is beyond terrible, and showed they could care less about the SAFETY of there guest.   I am still waiting for the manager to contact me and expect them to pay for my daughters new ipad and charger.  I came for a relaxing weekend that turned out to be a weekend from hell.

148456171,"I sure wish I would have read all the negative reviews, because every one of the reviews was absolutely true regarding the 1960's rooms!  Ha....I'm pretty sure I didn't see any pictures of those God-aweful rooms, because they KNOW that no one would choose to stay in them!  There are much better hotels out there with rooms much bigger and nicer, and less expensive.  I felt duped, to say the least, as we trusted Hotwire and this hotel to give us a 3 star room, since that is what we bid on!  Oh, and just a tip for those other guests who didn't like the musty smell of the rooms....always travel with a scented candle and firestarter...they work miracles in hotel rooms, and give you a nice glow at night while watching tv! :)  I really can't say anything positive about this place, honestly.  From check-in, paid parking (right! what parking!), no wi-fi (had to call and complain, and I was given a coupon code to use), hard uncomfortable beds, terribly small room with 2 queen beds...I can go on and on, but I won't.  It definitely wasn't anything close to the beautiful rooms I was admiring on their website after we bid on Hotwire and got $71 for a 3 star room!  We were so jazzed, as we saw the room rates varying from $125 to over $200!  So, be careful when you book this hotel...you really won't know what you are getting.  I suggest that the hotel be more responsible, and show that extra block of rooms from the 1960's and just offer those at the low rate of $70's if people like the location and ammenitites but can't quite afford the nice rooms in the tower.  I will never stay here again, if I can't be sure that I'm getting the room I reserve based on pictures.  We were so unhappy with it, we left after 2 nights, even though we paid for 3.

I call my friend and while in bed saw a white cloud passing across in front of the mirror. I start getting so nervous and almost cry I called immediately the front desk and explain them was going on . At that time that presence step behind me and all my body was in goose bumps. I got out of there and they put me in a room where the AC WAS NOT WORKING, so I was change again of room, at the end close to an alley. At least dint felt anything there.

165950886,"And not in a good way... The worst of the 1970s. The attached photo of the bedspread has not been altered in any way. I'll do my best to describe the rest: similarly hideously-patterned plastic-backed pull-chord curtains, royal blue carpet, mustard colored blankets, heavy &amp; ornately adorned faux-wood hutch, table and nightstand, 25&quot; tube television, gold-colored &quot;candelabra&quot; hung from the ceiling by matching chain links, 4&quot; white ceramic bathroom tiles, white formica countertop... Visit your local thrift shop if you can't quite picture the horror I'm describing. The walls are paper-thin, allowing you to clearly hear your neighbors. The champions next door treated me to 3 games of bedspring poker at 1:30, 4:30 and 7:00am.  The pillows are foam and do not resemble down pillows in any way. Now that I think of it, everything in the room was made of synthetic, man-made materials. Aside from a pool and ice machine, there no extra amenities. They charge $8.00 for 24 hours of wifi (ethernet not available). Breakfast is buffet style and $12.00. I did not partake of either.The front-desk customer service employees could benefit from basic customer service training. I went to the lobby on three occasions and not once did they eye contact with me. Perhaps they are charitably hiring workers that are on the autism spectrum. In one instance, Three of us patrons waited for 10 minutes while one person attempted to help a patient couple while one worker catatonically stared straight ahead the entire time and another shuffled papers for five minutes then took her purse and left on her break. It is in the Hotel Circle area with numerous other hotel options. Save yourself some money and stay somewhere else at half the price. It's not near anything except the Fashion Valley Mall. You will have to drive and become familiar with the freeways if you want to see San Diego's sites.  Trying to put a positive spin on it, it might be useful for a movie location if the director needs a tacky 1970s hotel setting. Or it could be useful for renewing wedding vows, if the couple wanted to be reminded of how far they've come since being poor newlyweds in the 1970s.",-1,4,0.348598049
161296428,"We attended a 3 day conference here. The conference was fine - the hotel was awful. Check in was a nightmare. We arrived at 11 and were told the room wasn't ready (not surprising - we were early) but would be ready in an hour. We joined the conference, returning at 1. Still not ready. Finally got in at 3, which wrecked my afternoon plans since the next conference session started within the hour. Although I did not experience a problem with bellman service, a number of conference participants badly needed help getting to their rooms with their luggage - and had no luck getting a bellman.There was another large group holding an event. When we returned to our room after dinner (9 ish), sleep was impossible as there was a loud band playing and the rooms were anything but sound proof...and I'd specifically asked for a quiet room when making my reservations.  We were in the main room tower on the 6th floor. Do you really need an amplified band blasting away right below the rooms?Catering: I'm not a huge foodie, but the meals were truly grim.  Everything was overcooked (vegetables to mush) and every entree was swimming in one or another overly sweet sauce.  Breakfast was as bad - liquidy scrambled eggs.  I choose to go across to the mall food court for lunch on Saturday because food court food was infinitely superior.  Really a sad commentary.Another source of annoyance was that just about everything had an extra charge. At a time when even mid-price motels have free wifi, this theoretically upscale resort charged for wifi. Bottles of water provided in the room had a price on them - we moved ours from one counter to another...and were charged for them (yes, the charge was ultimately removed). And, of course, this is California, so there was a hefty charge for parking.  The facility is very spread out and labyrinthian to negotiate. Anyone with mobility problems needs to beware bigtime. Check out was almost as bad as check in.  The automatic check out through the tv simply wasn't working (and that's at 6:45 AM, so not likely due to too many people trying to access at once). That meant we had to make our way to the lobby to check out. The conference rooms themselves were adequate to our needs. The hotel room was nice enough although the sink pressure was week and one of the sinks didn't drain very well.  All in all, a weak second to third rate.  I understand next year's conference is planned for Palm Springs.  Thank goodness, because if it were at Town &amp; Country, I'd give it a skip.",-1,3,0.524916944

We loaded everything back in the truck and drove to the lobby.  A girl at the front desk stated they were completely sold out of king beds.  I told her my reservation was specifially for a Traditional 1 King room, and the room was booked on Town &amp; Country's website, not a 3rd party website.  She asked if I would like to speak to a manager.  She walked away and began a conversation with Josie Rogers, Guest Services Manager, who &quot;peeked&quot; around the clerk to see who she was talking about.  She approached the desk and stated the same thing, they were sold out of king beds.  The only rooms available were two queen or two double.  I told her the same thing about specifically requesting this exact room type on their website.  She said there was nothing she could do.  She put a grounds map in front of me and told me two locations were queen or double rooms were available.  She was so rude and had a smirk on her face the entire time.  Before we walked out she said &quot;if I could go outside and build you a room with a king size bed I would&quot;.  We went to our two double bed room.  I went into the restroom and there were dead cockroaches on the floor.  My boyfriend called the front desk, asked for Josie, told her about the cockroaches and said there was nothing she could do.  He asked to speak to the hotel manager and was advised she was gone for the night.  He asked to speak to anyone about her and she said she was the biggest one there.  He asked for any other manager.  Jeremy Medica, Guest Services Manager, took the call and promptly apologized and stated he would do what he could to fix the situation.  He sent a bellman to our room and we were moved to a two queen bed room.  The next morning, Waneda Ambil, Front Office Manager and Josie &amp; Jeremy's supervisor called to offer us a king bed room.  We found this interesting as there was not one available the night before and there was no way anyone had checked out of a room that early and it was already clean and ready.  She also comped our first night.  I explained what had happened the night before, that we were not upset at all until Josie started speaking to us in a rude and condescending manner, with a smirk the entire time.  We have never been spoken to in that manner by hotel staff.  We met with Waneda to go over all details and she was doing fine until she said she would have to speak to Josie to see what happened.

39002924,"I stayed at the Town and Country for four nights in August for a business conference that was taking place at the convention center on the property.  This is a really odd hotel and I'm not quite sure what type of traveler it is built for.  Its not in an ideal location to be a relaxing resort, its not nice enough to be a good conference center, and its too expensive to be a budget hotel.  First of all you have the location, on I-8 just east of I-5.  While you're within a short drive of most of the San Diego area, you aren't really anywhere of interest.  You're not downtown, not by the ocean, just kind of out among lots of other hotels.The property is large and spread out.  Upon first look, it appears to be something out of 1960's Florida.  There are several buildings and each contains different types of rooms.  I stayed in the tower, which is at the back end (north end) of the property.  It's about eight levels and has exterior corridors.  Almost all rooms have a view of the pool below.  The room I received was damp and dank, even with the air conditioner running all day.  While it wasn't noticeably dirty, everything seemed to be sticky and there was a musty smell to the room.  The bed was a murphy bed (pulled down from the wall).  The TV cabinet doors would not stay open unless propped.  There was a door that joined with the room next door that was paper thin and didn't even reach the floor.  I could hear the slightest noise from the room next door, including every time the water was turned on and every footstep on the floor.  Fortunately my neighbor was another business traveler, so there wasn't much noise from the room.  After speaking with others who were staying in some of the other buildings on the property, it seems the tower offers the largest rooms.  My room had a wet bar and mini-fridge as well as a couch and dining table.  Rooms in the other buildings apparently did not have these amenities.  The tower rooms also have a balcony.Even at the discounted conference rate, this hotel was no deal.  Add on a $14 per day parking fee (no reason for it given the location) and a charge for internet, and this hotel is no value whatsoever.  I was able to get around the internet fee by connecting to the wireless signal from the cafe below my room.  For some reason that access was free and the signal was even stronger than the regular hotel signal.There are some aspects of the resort that were acceptable.  The grounds are nice to stroll around (although it's easy to get lost or turned around).  There are trees and rose gardens everywhere.  There are also a couple pools that looked well maintained.  The staff at the convention center was excellent.  Fast and attentive.  There is also a large shopping mall just north of the property, just across a small river and a street.  There are plenty of dining options within the resort as well as a few at the mall, all within easy walking distance.  But those aspects don't make up for the drawbacks or the high price.  One colleague of mine said she saw a rat on the property one morning.  Another checked out upon arrival when his room smelled so bad he couldn't stand it.  I didn't find anything so awful I felt I needed to leave, but I certainly won't be returning here.",-1,0,0.497515143
38314326,We stayed in the middle of Aug for 4 nights.  Reservation requested room in the courtyard of one of the pools.  I confirmed this at check in.  In short the room was down the hall from the pool not a courtyard room and worse the windows backed on to the parking traffic and staff smoking area.  Worse yet the pool nearest to us was closed.  We asked to move rooms and were given one in the rose garden.  Very nice room but a walk across a driveway to the operating pool - not a courtyard (we have a 5 and 7 yearold).  Requested to be moved to a courtyard to the pool for the next night.  We were told we'd have to wait and call in the morning?  Why?  I don't know - don't they know who's checking out the nite before?  Anyway it was too complicated to try to reason with the front desk.  The second nite we were moved to a room in the courtyard to the pool!!  We were happy but disappointed when the kids said that pool is freezing - I asked the front desk and she tells me that only the pool we had moved away from was heated.  This info may have come in handy had we not just moved to our third room in 2 nights.  In the end the kids walked 1/2 a block to the warm pool most nights.The hot water to the tub did not work right - it was extremely finnicky on how to get the magic 11 o'clock angle to get the hot water but after 30 minutes my husband figured it out.The only great thing was the bellmen they were all great and very helpful in moving our luggage from room to room and in suggesting places to eat and go out to.,-1,5,0.629450113

Eventually they found a room in 'The Tower', and directed us through the road construction to the parking 'out back'.The room was old, outdated, no insulation so you could hear the inhabitants of the next room using the toilet - as well as other activities.On four occasions, we had to contact the front desk to get towels, and 'complimentary coffee', since housekeeping had left none in the room.  On the last night we returned to find the dirty towels and sheets from the room in a pile outside of the door.  To our surprise the beds were made, but there were no towels, and no 'complimentary coffee'.  It took an hour to get them.There were loud parties going on on the patios well after midnight, which the hotel 'could not do anything about'.The restaurants on the property are mediocre, the food overpriced, and the staff rude- consistent with the rest of the property.The wireless internet service is $9.95 for 24 hours, but was out for the first day.  The hotel did set up a complimentary router for the conference use to compensate for it - but with 400+ people trying to use it the bandwidth and number of connections were ineadequate.Oh - and for dial-up, they charge for it.When booking beware:  The rates the second week of september were $49+.  The third week they were $169+. The last week, $119+.Bottom line:  The Staff are there for the convenience of the staff, not the customer. The conference has booked the same place next year.

They first put us in a room not in the tower - carpet was stained, tile was dirty, killed 2 bugs in the bathtub, curtains were broken.  I called down and asked what type of room my $149 rate gave me as I thought it was the new renovated ones.  The girl immediately told me it was and offered to me us to the tower.  This room was better but I would hardly call it renovated.  8 coats of paint on doors, bad chalking in the bath, wallpaper peeling off the walls and the chunks of concrete missing from the balcony.  It was rough.  Really too bad that they haven't done more to really make this a nice place.  The resort is huge and the grounds are beautiful but the rooms need some help.  I would be afraid to see what the $79 room looks like!  My advice is to go across the street to the Courtyard!",-1,3,0.497710438

To begin with, the customer service is horrible. I called for the location of the gym and was not told that there is actually an extra daily charge to use it. I found out when I arrived. The gym was not worth the extra cost. I asked for a small fridge for my room and was told it would entail an extra charge as well.Â Also, I was charged an early check out fee even though I explained to the manager it was a mistake, but they still refused to waive it. The parking attendants ate slow and inefficient.Â The rooms are dated, small and dingy. The walls and windows allow tons of sound In and out.

Outdoor entries to rooms; did not feel safe when walking to my room at night. Rooms featured stained wall paper, dirty tile around toilet and tub, very low water pressure and AC that never properly cooled the room. Service at Trellis was very slow, and they were appalled when our group of 12 came to eat. Room service food was particularly bad; I ordered fish tacos and cheesecake.

At first glance it didn't look like I had any comforter. The thickest blanket was still super thin, so I had to turn on the heater in 75 degree weather. When we made the long trek to the pool there were no towels there. We asked the lobby three times for towels and they never got delivered. We had to move pools. The jacuzzi felt like tepid bath water, it was warm but not hot and the foam was brown.

They have old dated wallpaper and then they painted the wall sconces bright purple and stuck wall-stickies of psychedelic shapes all over the hall walls.

I asked him questions and he had an irritated tone when he said 'I don't know' he never offered to find the answers to my questions just didn't know. But it seemed the rooms were filling up all around San Diego and I didn't want to have to stay in Tijuana for the night so I booked anyway.  Then when I got there the line was chacteristically long. There were four people checking people in and three standing at a desk talking... kind of annoying since it was a funny conversation for them and a long wait with children for us. We got booked into a room right next to a loud engagement party. They were up all night. So was my baby, he's not a very sound sleeper and any noise will wake him so if their song was a little slower or quieter he would fall asleep only to wake when the next loud song came on. Congrats to the happy couple but I [--] hate you! Then we were woken in the morning at 8am by the housekeeping, fell back asleep, they knocked again @9am. They don't all have to start with us do they? Oh well, at least I came to the door in my grannies panties. That should scare the guy off for a while. Since they had us up at that point I decided to treat us to breakfast at Terrace Cafe. WOW that was a MISTAKE!! We sat down, it took a while for the server to come over to us and he said &quot;are you ready to order?&quot; not exactly friendly but I'm not real picky first thing in the morning. We ordered, in the middle of the order I had a question so I asked, his response to my question about french toast and bacon &quot;If you're not ready yet I have other tables&quot; as he backs away, that was not my question. I let it go and waited for the ojs and waters that my table ordered.... waiting waiting waiting... the server is at all the other tables and is refilling coffee so I know he's been in the back, I'm sitting right next to the kitchen it's not a far walk to get some oj and water for us. Then I told the manager that I thought our server could use some help, I said &quot;I understand he seems busy&quot; Dude had 5 tables including ours, one was finished two only had 1 person each... sooo... he was not really that busy, but I was trying to give him the benefit of the doubt. So the manager said &quot;Thank you for telling me&quot; and walked away, I thought 'great I'm about to get some service now... THE MANAGER BROUGHT THE SERVER OUT TO CONFRONT ME! What kind of an unprofessional inexperienced person does that? I wasn't being rude, I wasn't wrong. Yet here they were standing over me with the server's eyes rolling saying &quot;What do you want me to do about it? I'm working on it, it's coming&quot; I was so uncomfortable it was a very threatening moment for me to have them both angry and standing over me. So after they walked away I approached the manager one more time and said &quot;Excuse me I just want you to know that was very unprofessional and it made me feel very uncomfortable&quot; he said &quot;What do you want me to do&quot; and in his eyes he really seemed like he really didn't know what he was supposed to do when a customer has a complaint about something. Why is &quot;What do you want me to do&quot; the catchphrase of that restaurant? Not to mention the menu was crap. I told him that what he was supposed to do in that situation is apologize to the customer and get their drinks out to their table, check on the food and make sure that the rest of our service was better. I'd have been fine with bad service but hostile? wow! I am never going back there. I go to San Diego once a month I only live in LA and we love our long weekends in Daygo, and we've stayed here twice... Both times I found pubes in the tub. First time only other person in the tub before I found it was my 10month old baby, I know it wasn't his but there it was floating through the water toward my happy baby boy.

To get everything wrong as consistently as the Town and Country does - they have to be trying.  No way could this much badness be an accident.  Sleep on a park bench before you stay here.A few highlights, I mean lowlights.  The rooms are very old, dingy, and dated, all beat up.  All rooms are entered from the exterior - there are no interior hallways.  The headboard for my bed didn't actually reach to the floor.  It was too small so it had been bolted to the wall.  The alarm clock was hidden behind the TV with the cord wrapped around it (so off) - I found that it on the last night of my stay.  TV was blurry, I don't know how they managed that with cable.  It was perfectly alright for a hotel worker to stroll along the hallway at 5am with a noisy cart - who needs sleep?  The bathroom door would not close - it was one of those sliding doors that had come off the runners years ago - which is probably an apt metaphor for the entire property.  No safes in the rooms, great for a conference venue where everybody brings a laptop.  No ramp to get into the tower unless you walk all the way round the back.  Conference logistics were anything but logical - meeting rooms downstairs, exhibition halls and break rooms upstairs, not reachable without going outdoors (it was raining of course).  The &quot;high-speed&quot; internet timed out on simple Google searches.The food was even worse.  Kelly's is the worst restaurant I have eaten at in a very long time.  After being seated we waited 30 minutes for someone to say, &quot;I'll be with you in a few minutes.&quot;  Drink orders were taken, then another 30 minutes later, food orders.  When we complained the server was extremely rude.  The food was abysmal - $25 filets and such that were not as good as you can get at Denny's.  My &quot;demi glaze&quot; was actually a runny soup.  My neighbor's ribs were &quot;horrid&quot;.  Last night there I ordered a hamburger and a beer from room service.  It arrived 95 minutes later.  1 hour and 35 minutes for a hamburger!  I called twice to ask about the delay and was assured both times that it was on its way.  It wasn't of course, which was easy to tell because my receipt had the order time printed on it - after my call.  The room service was also rude to me when I asked why a hamburger was taking so long.Everything about this hotel screams cost cutting and being cheap.  Calling a place a resort that is (a) in the middle of town, (b) has nothing but a pool, and (c) has consistently below standard service and amenities - is just wrong.This was not an individual bad experience.  I was at a conference with about 150 colleagues and it became a running joke how bad the place was.

The front desk staff were not very welcoming, and although we arrived early, we were told our rooms would be ready by 3:30pm.  We checked back with front desk staff at 4:30, and only one of two rooms were ready.  It was 5:45 pm before the second room was ready.  The front desk staff did not apologize for the inconvenience at all.The rooms were not what we had registered for nor confirmed.  We registered for rooms with king beds and both of us actually ended up with rooms that had two double beds.Both rooms had 1 inch gaps between the bottom of the door and the flooring, which would have allowed insects and small critters to enter the room.  As a result, we both stuffed towels and pillows under our doors each night to avoid such scenarios. One room did not have a hair dryer available, and when one was requested, it took nearly 55 minutes before it was delivered.  When my friend attempted to use the hairdryer, there were sparks coming from the plug of it.The bathtub in one room was not clean â there were rings of soap remaining from shampoo bottles utilized by previous occupants. The Kleenex box was empty and was not refilled for two day and the dÃ©cor was extremely dated - like 1980s!!  There were no desks in the rooms for working, and as a resort that is accustomed to hosting business conferences, the rooms should all have proper desks and appropriate chairs conducive to business.  The small round table and chairs are absolutely not conducive to effective working conditions for business personnel.  There were no extra blankets available in the room which is especially critical since neither the heating nor air conditioning units were in working order. The water bottles in both rooms were not replenished after being consumed by occupants 2 and 3 days prior. There was no refrigerator or mini bar/snack bar available in rooms which is absolutely standard at every other &quot;resort&quot; I have stayed at. A proper resort would never offer a combo shampoo/conditioner product, but rather would offer spa quality personal products.  As a result, my collegue and I went out and purchased shampoo and condictioner for use during our stay.One of our rooms was located next to a housekeeping room, and staff was extremely loud and disruptive beginning as early as 5:30am. So rude and inconsiderate!!!! Numerous carts were being pushed around at all hours of the day and night by staff, and was extremely disruptive.  Many conference attendees had the same complaint.The security was inadequate to assure the safety of hotel guests.  While this is a large complex, the resort could and should implement some basic safety precautions, such as having security personnel on duty and walking the premises, installing entrances that require use of card keys to enter hotel areas.  Anyone could walk onto this property at any time without being stopped by personnel or card key access points. The food and service quality at each of the hotel restaurants was substandard.  The staff no more than handed us our menus, and they proceeded to ask us if we were ready to order.  When we requested another minute or two, they walked away and did not check back with us for nearly 10 minutes.  Despite our attempts to get their attention, they continued to talk with other restaurant staff, and were oblivious to our attempts to wave them over/get their attention.  Once we got our food, we repeatedly waited in excess of 15-20 minutes before our wait staff checked in and gave us our bill.There was a fitness center on the property but we were told that cost extra.  That is ridiculous to charge extra for fitness center...especially at a resort!To top this ALL off, when we went down to check out, we weren't even asked how our stay was which I guess is not surprising b/c Im sure they are tired of hearing from guests how bad it is.  They also didn't even offer to help us out to a cab with our big bags and is not easy to get out the door of that lobby.  Appalling!!!!This entire property is in dire need of updating and a general maintenance overhaul!I would NEVER return to this resort and will not recommend this facility to any friends or colleagues, nor for any future conferences.  I hope they take this feedback seriously.",-1,16,0.436281179

First, if you are taller than 5 foot, showering is impossible as the showered heads are approximately 65 inches tall. Even after speaking with management, and told &quot;Its an old building&quot; there was nothing done and we were told all rooms were the same. Being only 5'6&quot; I feel this is a ridiculous situation. Then, after being locked out of our room at midnight, even though we had a l call to the manager about this issue at 5 pm, we were told there was no record of our &quot;complaint&quot;  Then why would be asking for new keys to our room if there was no problem?  They then had the nerve to blame us for deadbolting the door. From the outside?  How does a person do that? The humerous part is the lock was repaired  no mention Of a deadbolt  The management here passes the buck from shift to shift.  For someone who works in the hotel industry, I would expect much more.  The housekeepers are awful and the restaurants were obviously made to cater to a captive audience because the food is equivalent to a high school cafeteria.

A month before check-in, I called again to 1) request a refurbed room and 2) add an add'l night.  Was quoted $325 for Sunday night!  No, thanks.  Read the reviews here and was uneasy about the stay.Check-in was slow.  4 staff for a long line of check-in at 3pm for a 4pm conference start.  That happens.  Asked 'is this a refurbed room?'  Oh, yes.  FYI - $19/day for parking and $50 'early departure fee'. As this was the second conference of three, I had my suitcase shipped to the hotel.  'Pick it up at the loading dock and fee of $25'.  This is all in addition to a $20/day resort fee.  Resort fees are common.  Ok.Got to the room and there are constructions crews every where including a shute from a few floors up to the ground.  Where is my room?  Right around the corner.  And...the key doesn't work on the digital pad  Walked over to the Loading Dock to get my suitcase.  Gentleman was very nice and offered to help with the key.  'Oh, I've never seen a lock like this.'From end of the property back to reception.  'The key doesn't work'  Get a new set of keys (larger and orange instead of small and blue) and back to the room.  These work.  And...the room is for handicapped.  That's not right.  Back to the reception.  The first staff member says 'no, it is not a handicapped room.  'Open shower with two shower heads and pull down bench with grab rails on every wall means handicapped.  I don't need one.  It should be saved for someone who needs it.'  Second staff says 'that's all we have available.'  At this point, I've given up.The room was clean and old.  There was an inch of space between the floor and the door so plenty of light.  Big bathroom is nice.  The mirrored closet doors were sticky, broken and held together by tape.  Had a small fridge and a smaller coffee pot.  Solid unsecure wifi.  Big slider window with a small table &amp; 2 chairs that opened onto a busy walkway.  Decent tv with Cox Cable. No premium channels.The construction noise was awful.  Truck backing up, jackhammers, men yelling at each other and for 2 hours on Saturday morning (8am-10am) the beep beep beep of a lift alarm from the construction crew.  Noise cancelling headphones helped.  I get it.  Construction crews are trying to get ahead to avoid penalties.  The upside:  The Terrace breakfast buffet was good.  Although room service is faster with more variety.  There is a coffee shop next door that serves Starbucks altho the line was usually out the down, down the porch and stairs.  The grounds are lovely!  Beautiful roses, little spots to sit,  great looking pools and spas.  There is a day spa and gym on the property as well.  The standout is Charlie's.  It's BBQ and a bar.  Patio seating.  Lots of big tvs and a game room.  Really great BBQ and beer.  And happy hour starts at 2pm!  Great wait staff especially Jeanine and Chris.There are cute little bungalows, a few 2 story buildings, a dog run and the 2 towers.  Get a bungalow.  I was able to peak inside a few while they were being cleaned.  Plus they are in a quieter area away from the pools, construction.  The grounds are lovely.  The staff (minus reception) are pleasant and friendly.  The BBQ is great.

We'd arrived early yesterday about 11 am and was told our room is now ready which is normal. But what is not normal that we had to ask about our room aroind 3 pm and were told maybe in hour - the lady was pretty rude on the phone so my husband had to come to the lobby and yell at them only then we got the &quot;suite&quot; as an apology .

117138631,"I would not recommend this place to anyone. The staff was rude and unprofessional to us from the moment we arrived. For example, we asked the bell staff to call us a cab--but instead, Elisha--the bell captain, gave us a card for her friend's private (and undoubtedly more expensive) car service. This was happening as we watched other cabs pull up to the hotel for other guests. I think she figured we were young and was trying to take advantage of us with the expensive car service, while she had no problem calling cabs for other older customers. The next day we used their complimentary shuttle to drive five minutes away to order take out In N Out Burger to bring back for our group. This was working perfectly until we called the hotel to have the van come get us and were told it would be 25 minutes before they could come. This was after we were told by the driver to simply call the hotel when we were done and they'd come right back and get us. And oh guess, what--surprise, surprise, Rhodes Scholar, Elisha was in charge of dispatching the vans and wouldn't send one to get us. She said the driver was on lunch. Oh really? You knew you had customers out and would need a ride back soon and you approved a lunch break when nobody else would be available to pick us up? Brilliant. They also refused to pay for a cab to bring us back, so we had to simply wait for the van to &quot;become available&quot; as Elisha put it. When the driver finally returned, he asked what took so long and said that he was never on lunch. So the dispatch is lying now. Upon returning to the hotel, I asked for Elisha's manager, though the only person around that was above Elisha was a similarly unprofessional woman named Tina. As Elisha went to tell Tina that we were waiting for her in the lobby, we literally saw Tina roll her eyes in annoyance that we wanted to speak to her about this. Tina was as unwillingly to apologize for this error as I imagined she would be. And she even had the gall to blame the driver more than once. Wow. Sure, blame the lowest guy on the totem pole for a mistake that you could have easily corrected, and couldn't have possibly been his fault as he is not the one dispatching the vans. At one point, she must have been exhausted by my insistence that she apologize and take ownership b/c she turned exasperatedly to her  partner in crime (Elisha) and whined, &quot;What is it that she wants me to do for her? I mean, is there anything we can possibly do for her???&quot; Mind you reader, she is asking this with all the sarcasm and disrespect she could muster. So there you go. And for the record, the only nice staff members we encountered there were the van drivers. We had used them several times before this incident and Oscar, Orlando or Octavio--can't remember which, and Kirk or Kurt--can't remember which, were ALL extremely polite, helpful and courteous. The problem there is Elisha. And Tina. And however much further up the chain of command it goes--I don't know. Additionally, the decor was outdated, and the grounds a little run down. Beautiful roses were in bloom, but also untidy. We had to shout &quot;Hello? Is anybody here?&quot; when we first walked into one of the restaurants bc nobody was staffing it. We ate one meal there and it was good, but nothing to write home about. They have three pools on the property and oddly they wouldn't serve food or drink at the pool. There was a complete lack of visible signage which was annoying b/c it is a big property and easy to lose your way. We had two hair dryers plugged into one room and the power went out.We joked about this hotel feeling like an assisted living community b/c there were so many old people in wheelchairs and the decor lives up to that. Additionally, the gal in our group who booked the hotel, was told by a hotel staff member that the hotel was walking distance from the beach. It is not. It is a 15 minute drive.

About 20 more people came in with the same complaint so they finally let us park in the 20 minute parking place over night. They said we wouldnt be towed away. Without even taking the type of car we had. When we finally to to the room after 1 1.5 hours we saw all types of big rodents or badgers roaming around the premise.

Upon arrival, we (my girlfriend and I) checked into the hotel just a stroke before midnight, and were informed that we had already been checked in. We both exchanged a few words of confusion, which I'll just assume the front desk employee didn't pick up on, and were handed keys and shown a map of where we were to park. The hotel is spread out over a sizable area, with a portion of the rooms being in a 10-story or so tower-like building and the rest of them being in what I can only describe as trailers. Not trailers like the on-wheels kind of trailers, I mean trailer park trailers. If a trailer park and an apartment complex had an illegitimate child, it would probably be called the Town and Country Resort.We ended up driving for 20-30 minutes searching for parking, as the parking situation is best described by the words &quot;pure idiocy&quot; and &quot;moronic&quot;. The vast majority of the &quot;streets&quot; around the &quot;resort&quot; are practically one lane, leading to plenty of drawn out and awkward scenarios where you'll be maneuvering around another poor soul's car. Each set of trailers has it's own parking lot, only fitting about 20 cars or so, which is far too few. Around the corner is a two-story parking structure (one lane) and with a bafflingly low 6-foot clearance. In our search for a parking spot, we drove around the cramped structure only to reach the abrupt end of it, which is just a wall, so getting out of the structure (one lane, still) involves having to make your car shuffle into the opposite direction to leave, while hoping no one is coming in the opposite direction. We finally found parking in the back lot, which is much larger but has tiny parking spots and, again, narrow lanes to navigate. We got out of the car and spent 5-10 minutes walking back to our trailer style room, slid the key into the door, opened the door, and were greeted with a room with luggage and clothes strewn about, as it was already inhabited. We left and made management aware, who offered us another trailer room, which we dutifully declined, already angry that it was now pushing midnight and we just spent 20 minutes looking for parking just to turn right back around.Skipping all of the issues between, we were eventually moved to a room in the tower style building. Like the rest of the hotel, the room is disastrously dated. Don't let the photos online fool you, I am scrolling through their provided room photos now and none of them match the room we were in, which I'm assuming was a step-up from the trailer style room. The bathroom is small and the floor is made of dirty tiles, and (my favorite part) the shower head is about 5'5&quot;, so I spent a great deal of time trying to kneel down beneath it. I just grit my teeth and pushed through this problem though, as I knew that the quicker I got showered and dressed, the quicker we could leave this horrid place.I would not suggest this hotel to anyone, not even my worst enemy. I've stayed at plenty of hotels that looked cheap or dated on the outside, but had those stays redeemed by passable room interior- this was not the case.

The check-in people were nice, however, it took 40 minutes! to check in and 30 minutes! to check out - I've never had to wait that long to check-in and out.  The resort is huge and it seemed to be well kept - they did have carts to take people to their rooms, however, I decided to walk it by myself.  My room was nice and clean, however, it did not have a microwave or refrigerator so all food had to be ordered at one of their very high priced restaurants or you could walk across the street to the mall, which had several options.  The bed was nice to sleep in, but the bathroom was a little run-down.  The resort had several pools to swim in, but the fitness center and hot tub were in a different building and you had to pay for that, along with having no breakfast or nightly reception available at the resort - If you come here just get used to paying for every little thing you can imagine - not a lot is free here.  On the positive side - the Fashion Valley Mall is across the road and the trolley stops right in front of the hotel and the trolley can take you all over San Diego - I would definitely recommend it - very inexpensive and fairly clean.  The restaurants on site have good food, however, they are insanely pricey.

On another night, I woke up to a huge water bug in my bathroom which could have crawled in through the front door because the front door of the room had a big gap at the bottom of the door. I was on the second floor of the hotel and I had a feeling I would have some type of an animal crawling in, and of course it happened. The hotel definitely needs to be refurbished.

You cannot guarantee a non-smoking room, even if I book 5 months in advance?  What do you mean, Kinkos 5 miles away when there is a business center at the conference center on site?  What do you mean, 'we are a conference center, we cannot guarantee that service?&quot;  Is there a single hotelier on staff?  What do you mean, the Sea World rate is cheaper than the conference rate, and I cannot get the Sea World rate because you now know that I am at the conference?I have never experienced a staff more trained at knowing nothing in all my travels.  They were very well trained at being polite and not answering questions.  While I am sure this is not their fault, who the heck is running this operation?

405533916,"I attended a convention here, and did not stay in the hotel. The hotel did not have enough rooms to accomodate our convention attendees so many of us had to find lodging elsewhere.It was a very incovenient and unpleasant convention venue. Meeting rooms are spread out over a large area and finding anything was like getting lost in a rat's maze. Even the bathrooms are hard to find. You have to walk outside in the direct sunlight to get anywhere, so you have to remember sunscreen, a big hat &amp; sunglasses. There was no staff available to ask directions. There were no phones available anywhere in the complex to call the front desk. People wasted a lot of  time just wandering around trying to find places.There was no wi fi. How can you have a convention with international &amp; out of state guests and exhibitors with NO WI FI?!! Since there was no way to contact the front desk, except walking a long ways to ask them in person, it was never clear if there was a paid wi-fi service available. It was a disaster.The convention area is completely disjointed from the hotel itself, so there's no reception area or staff. The few staffers who were in the convention area were more lost than we were. No one seemed to know where anything was.There were plenty of complaints about the restaurants from attendees. There were 3 restaurants in the convention area, with one provisional lunch place set up. Since convention goers are on basically the same schedule, eating at the same times, the lines were tremendous. Staff just didn't seem to be able to handle it.We have held this same convention in many other venues across the US for many years. There is usually a central bar, or meeting place where people can sit and chat in between events and order a coffee or drink. The only place that came close was the coffee shop with outdoor seating, but it was way off to the side of the convention rooms. It just didn't work. This might be a fun place to hang out on vacation, to wander around the maze of convention rooms in the hot sun and sit outside at a picnic table, but it's just not appropriate for a convention. This isn't a place of business. It's a poolside resort.",-1,3,0.393487395
120182605,"We were at the T&amp;C for the World Fantasy Convention, along with about 1000 other professionals in the literary field.  We booked a suite and an additional room - and received anything but VIP or decent service.  The maids forgot something major every day - despite a $5 tip in each room (you try drying yourself with washcloths because there's no bath towels). The rooms were dusty and mildewy; we had to have the air filter changed because it dripped with dust bunnies.  The faux New England decor must be from the 80-'s; it's like Laura Ashley vomited in the rooms; I mean, it's Southern California!  What happened to light, airy, comfortable - and above all, modern?!  This place needs a serious overhaul.  Peeling paint, doors that stuck, dirty dusty fake flowers, a bed mattress that must have been 20 years old, peeling stickers on the glass doors, and dust and cobwebs everywhere.  We expect a bit more when charged $2500 for an 8 day stay.The resort was laughable; horrible food in the restaurants (when open); no disabled access to the coffee shop when the restaurant was closed, because the only ramp goes into the restaurant - and an extremely b***chy hotel rep who basically called me a liar when I said an attendee in a wheelchair couldn't get in.  There are serious fines for not being in ADA compliance, I believe - and they should get the book thrown at them.We waited four hours for a luggage cart to move items to the convention ctr; we were charged for a package left at the front desk 10 mins. before we arrived; they charged $10 a day for internet (hello, 1993!); they didn't clean the bathroom before our arrival; the main bar we were supposed to use (Trellis') was closed most evenings, and when open was seriously understaffed, and with horrible food and expensive drinks; Charley's was the same liquor at half the price, so that's where we went.I understand that this is used for a bunch of regional conventions - but boy, we are not a Shriner's or Comic-Con bunch, and we are used to a good hotel, good service, good value for your money, and this place failed to meet all expectations, and was a complete wipeout as an enjoyable decent place to stay.  Beautiful rosebushes all around were all that was presentable about this place.  It was like my grandmother's retirement community, stuck somewhere about 1983.I am not sure why people like this place - understaffed and surly customer service (they wouldn't even recommend any restaurants apart from the ones on the premises, and they were awful), so I can't imagine why they are still in business.  If I need to attend a convention in San Diego ever again, it's back to the Hotel Coronado for us and our employees.  This place was terrible.The only positive I have to say about this place is that the catering person who helped me make my room reservations months before was really helpful; although she'd quit by the time the con started.",-1,4,0.545288671

My room smelled like it had not had fresh air in years. The carpet was stained. All rooms have outside door access with doors that do not swing shut automatically. Since the property is not secured from street access this poses a safety risk for women traveling alone. Upgrades to the building that has more that two floors is $60 a night, making the room way over priced. Of course when the unacceptable condition of the room for the price is reported, you receive a response that you signed the agreement to pay the upgrade so nothing can be done.

3742570,"I just returned yesterday from a 5-day conference at the Town and Country, along with other coworkers.  Before leaving home I read the previous tripadvisor reviews and knew some of the concerns.  I stayed with a coworker in a &quot;bungalow&quot; facing one of the 4 swimming pools, and at first was pleasantly surprised by the size of the room (included sitting area), vaulted ceiling, dark colonial styled furniture, and colorful wallpaper (although dated).  We had a lovely view of the pool and tropical vegetation if we kept the drapes open, although people could then look into the room.  The bathroom wallpaper was pealing in places, but not bad.  The room was clean, and well-supplied with towels, etc.  The handle on the bathroom sink kept coming unscrewed.  The room clock/radio periodically made loud humming noises, so we finally unplugged it.  The mattresses were VERY firm, too firm for me.  The walls were somewhat thin, as we could hear the doors slamming closed next door, the service personnel rolling their carts back and forth over the cobbled walkway outside, and people talking as they walked by.  After the first night we turned the room AC fan up on full to help drown out the noises. There is a charge for all calls outside the resort, including 1-800 calling cards and local calls, and you have to pay by the day to use the exercise facilities.  We got parking included with the conference fees, but other people staying there had to pay.  There were billing problems for many of the folks from our group, which still weren't resolved when we left.  A PO had been issued by our employer to cover room costs, but the front desk hotel personnel (usually &quot;interns&quot;) insisted upon billing someone for each room.  Some of our group got angry and refused to give them a credit card #.  One supervisor was told her credit card would be billed for the total cost of the group.  Two of my coworkers said they had problems with their rooms, and called for maintanence, who promised to be right there and never showed up.  The food at the restaurants onsite was overpriced, so most of us went to the mall next door to eat, or drove to other San Diego locations.  The tram system is right behind the resort, and very handy to travel about town.  It even goes all the way to Tijuana.  I wouldn't stay at the T &amp; C again, especially at the rates our employer was charged.  The best things about the T &amp; C are the grounds (lovely tropical flowers, vines and roses everywhere with gazebos, trellises, benches, and the pools), and the location next to the trolley system and mall.  It's worth walking through to see the resort grounds, but stay somewhere else if you have the choice, unless you get a super deal.",-1,0,0.469374308
3703143,"Where to even begin, let's start with the $12.00 a day parking fee that they throw at you when you check-in.. Has anybody ever heard of getting charged to park in a hotel parking lot in which you have reservations for? On top of that they charge $15.00 per day occupancy tax yet again adding more to the bottom line when checking in. We decided to rent a movie off of the service that is provided in the room which was a great movie but did not expect to pay $11.00 for it and the $2.00 movie tax they charge on top of that. So what ever your quote is to stay at this hole go ahead and tack on $54.00 and an additional $13 if you rent a movie. I won't even go into how over priced room service was.

209829211,"Two months ago I started speaking with the senior saleswoman to set up over 60 rooms for my daughter's softball league.  Prior to signing the contract for the rooms I was promised the following.  We would be in the renovated rooms and we would all be together, four tickets for what she called their &quot;HOT&quot; breakfast buffet and free parking.  So where do I start?  When parents started checking in some of them did not get the rooms that were promised and were scattered in different buildings.  That ruined the point of being together as league so right off the bat the fun was taken away.  One parent called me and found feminine napkins that were full of blood in the trash cans and their room was dirty.  I went to see their room myself and let me tell you the room was exactly what an hourly rate room.  Wow embarrassing!!!!  It was very stressful to hear how parents were being treated after they began complaining.  The rep had given me her phone number whether is the hotel cell phone or her personal cellphone.  She answered it and attempted to give me us all drink tickets.  For what??  To forget about the conditions of our rooms, the condition of the entire hotel, how we were being treated at the front desk by Jeremy who just simply said there is nothing I can do.  So lets move on to breakfast because I can go on and on.  Breakfast was modified by the sales rep because she stated that it would be better if we were separated from other patrons since we were a large group.  Well the buffet style breakfast now became eggs, bacon, waffles, three different types of cereal, milk, small cups of juice, and coffee,  I guess it was alright, but again what is stated on the contract I signed was not delivered.  The free parking well I guess that was the perk that worked out.  The grounds themselves are nice, but once you go into the buildings oh my god you are transformed into another world and its not pretty.  Everything and I mean everything is outdated and falling apart.  I normally do not even waste my time writing reviews and I do sometimes check on what others right before I stay somewhere.  I hope that future guests read this review and choose to stay somewhere else because to this day my phone calls, emails are being ignored.  I could continue writing and writing, but my point to this review is that what I was promised through emails and verbally was not delivered.

The showers had warm water only and the pool had no towels at 11:30 in the afternoon and the towels they called pool towels were about the size of a large dish towel.   Parking was another joke around the property but maybe because it was a labor day weekend.   I don't even believe that they could refurbish this property minus tearing it down and starting over.

Some of the money coming in from higher rates and extra fees really needs to go back into the rooms and grounds.  Planting rose bushes everywhere may make the grounds pretty, but it doesn't mask peeling paint, dated decor, and bathrooms that need a replacement of tubs/toilets/tiles etc.  You can only pile on grout and sticky sealants so many times before it looks really tacky.If you are staying here by choice, rethink it.  There are better values and better rooms in the same vicinity.  If you are here for a conference, just be sure you don't leave anything behind and deal very frankly and firmly with the staff.

The first room they gave me had a strong smell of pee and old carpet and mildew. I had a hard time breathing, and called the front desk asking to move me. The had me on hold for 10 minutes, because they were busy. The room they moved me to was on the second floor and was less stinky, but it still stank of old carpet. The rooms are sooo tiny, i haven't seen such tiny rooms since i stayed in an inexpensive hotel in center of Paris. The furniture is very old. The TV was antique(maybe they tried to match the furniture). The blanket had a hole and a large dirty stain. The decor is very busy, and makes you dizzy, especially because the room is so small. The housekeeping wasn't great, but i brought it to manager's attention.Overall, you feel like you are in a 1 star motel. The grounds are large, and there are many rose bushes and beautiful trees.

The surcharge was for use of wifi, spa, shuttle to fashion valley which was a pleasant 3 minute walk away.

134823434,"I work for a federal agency and traveled to the Town and Country for a work related conference. I made my reservation via telephone on March 11 for my stay March 29- APril 1 2012. I asked for an email confirmation of my reservation. As the date for my trip approached, I realized I had never received an email confirmation, but I thought, no big deal. BOY WAS I WRONG!! When I arrived around 3 PM on March 29th, the indifferent attendant informed me that my reservation had been cancelled and I was charged a night stay because I failed to show up on the previous day, which she stated my reservation was for. I informed her that this was a work trip and I would not have made a reservation for the wrong day and I had never received email confirmation or I would have noticed the error and fixed it. I implored to her to take the charge off. She wouldnât. I got the manager involved, who said she would only give me a $40 credit for a $139 charge.At this point I was stunned and upset by the total lack of customer service, but I still had a conference to attend so I begrudgingly continued with my check in, ANOTHER BIG MISTAKE. The room I was given was the only occupied room and a wing of the hotel that was under construction. In fact, I had to walk through a construction zone to get to my room! Once inside the room all I had was hammering, power tools, and other construction related noises and all I saw out of my sliding glass door was a procession of construction workers going to and fro. I called the front desk and told them my room in the construction zone was unacceptable. Again I spoke to the unhelpful manager (who I dealt with minutes earlier with the reservation debaucle), I believe her name is Katie, who gave me two choices: go to another room or cancel my reservation and she would refund my charges. Of course I picked option two and immediately got off the phone and found a great place near by, as I still had to attend the conference at the Town and Country. I stopped by the hotel lobby on the way out to receive documentation of the refund for the charges to my corporate credit card, as this was a business trip and all charges had to be accounted for. I received a paper that showed the charges and then showed a credit of the total charges of $237.72. I asked the indifferent attendant directly âSO this amount of $237.72 is what will be credited to my account?â and she responded âYesâ, obviously annoyed.WRONG AGAIN. These people never did nor had any intention of crediting my account. Apparently, the documentation I THOUGHT was proof they refunded my accounted was actually what is called a âfolioâ which, according to my credit card dispute representative, simply shows the CHARGES to your account. I had been duped! AGAIN!!This was the worse hotel experience I ever had and I am appalled that these people are actually fighting me on trying to get the money they fraudulently charged me back! I obviously NEVER stayed there and Iâm certain that NO ONE would have stayed in that room they put me in so it is not like they lost money! If you choose to stay here, which I obviously would not recommend, make sure you get ANY correspondence with this place IN WRITING, otherwise you will be playing the âhe said, she saidâ game that I am playing now.

Remember, each room has a 14$/day resort fee in addition to the daily rate.Here is the kicker, when you reach there, they will tell you that you have to pay 18$/day for parking! this is not mentioned anywhere, and the booking company refrains from telling you this as well. call them and get that money back.What is worse is that there are no parking spots on site during weekends/conferences although you are paying for it. you need to park semi-illegally.The hotel rooms are below average. The sheet that we slept on had nothing between us and the water resistant mattress cover.The blanket/comforter was just spread in between two sheets and had no closed edges. So unless you like used comforters on yourself, this is not pleasant.Sometimes they miss room service, which I find is really sub standard.The kicker came when one of the beds in one of the rooms had bedbugs. yes, that's right - bedbugs. My friend was bitten profusely on his legs and when we notified the hotel, they didn't bother getting back to us. then we tried again, same response - promises to get back but no call back...finally we got a supervisor, who was able to allocate another room and arrange for a move late at night.The only reason the word bedbugs is not on the title in caps is because they waived the resort fees for one room, and the parking fee when we told them what we went through at checkout - again this was not done voluntarily, we had to ask for it.Overall, I am not very picky, but I have major phobia wrt to bugs in my bed, and this was very traumatizing. I am not sure I will stay at this hotel again, but the rate is decent and the location is awesome.

The hotel has extra charges for everything.

The lack of maintenance in the room such as a broken lamp and a electrical outlet that was torn off the wall was not seen by housekeeping prior to check in. I would think that housekeeping would check to make sure everything in the room is in working order before they put a guest in there. I went to the Front desk and they did not move me or offer additional housekeeping services to clean the build up of black mold in the room. I asked to speak to the General Manager and was told that the Front Office Manager was the only one that could handle issues. He had a very strange schedule so to get up with him on this issues was not an easy task. After day 3 I was finally able to speak with the FOM. They did offer a movie and popcorn!! Really how about a clean room? The mold was never taken care of and I draped towels over the counters and bathroom floors so I did have to look at it. I even went out and bought Lysol wipes and cleaned my room. The hotel is located next to a transit station where many homeless people slept and hung out and this was a true safety issue for many of the people there when we wanted to go somewhere.

Although the roach I shared the room with the first night seemed like a nice enough character.  I complained about the condition of my room to my association and I was told, to âget in lineâ as many of the other attendees were complaining also.

The food is bland, over priced and unless you like hanging out in a lifeless, barfly setting, not the place to be.English is also obviously a problem here, because unless you are inside the hotel building (sorry âresortâ) finding someone on property to speak the language is equal to Indiana Jones finding the Lost Ark.

Then I was given a Sheet detailing a host of other potential fees for everything from smoking in the non-smoking room to a $1,500 fee for steam cleaning the rug if needed.  I was irritated but after starting travel at 5am, I wasn't prepared to look for another hotel after 10 pm.  When given the key there was yet another fee of $15.  The room itself was not in the glossy high rise, but something from the Bates motel, a single story room from an old motor court style motel tucked in the far corner of the property close to a frontage style road next to the freeway.  That might have been okay, but the parking lot was on the other side, forcing guests to leave their cars well away from the room and walk down dimly light creepy corridors looking for Norman Bates along the way.  The air conditioner was blasting, leaving the room dank with moisture hours later.  The blue carpeting was badly in need of replacement, and seemed crusty to walk on.  I tried to discuss the inflated price to 3 different desk clerks, one asked to see my confirmation of the stated rates.  When shown the quoted total fees quote was more than $50 lower, I was told of course that price was wrong because it did not include the hotel and other taxes.  Right.  Do not stay here the motel 6 down the road would have been a much better option.",-1,1,0.519594017

Two &quot;queen&quot; beds filled the area with less than two feet between end of bed and furniture.  Two suitcases would not fit in the room.  Bed beside window was too close to room a/c which blew cold air directly onto bed.  Humidity and cold air do not mix thus we had condensation forming on the sheets - cold damp and miserable.  Unfortunately, turning the ac off resulted in a horrible stench of urine.  Door to room did not close tightly and had a good 1.5 inch gap between floor and door.

137114794,"Our family of 4 stayed here in July for the Albion Cup soccer tournament.  After reading the reviews on TripAdvisors, I had concerns about staying here so I specifically asked for reservations in one of the renovated rooms, which was email confirmed by the resort.  When we arrived, the check-in area was a mob scene, which was a clear indication of things to come. I find out that not only were the soccer tournament teams staying here, but teams from a martial arts competition as well as a basketball tournament were also staying here at the same time.  They initially assigned us to the Regency Tower, where the lobby area reeked of cigarettes.  Upon entering the room, we could smell an even stronger smell of cigarette smoke.  We immediately called the front desk demanding a non-smoking room (which we also requested and was initially email confirmed by the hotel).  The girl at the front desk insisted that there weren't any other rooms available because of all the tournaments.  Then another lady takes over the phone and tells me that we have been assigned the wrong room.  They then moved us into one of rooms in the bungalow complex.  Unfortunately this room only has one king bed, for the four of us!  Excuse me, this is still not the room we requested.  (They didn't even offer to provide a roll away bed.)  Although the room didn't smell like an ashtray, it was the equivalent of a Motel 6 room, particularly the louver type windows that didn't completely close allowing all outside noise into the room.  The room also came with WiFi.  Unfortunately it was so slow it was completely useless.  I wanted to write this review that night we checked in, but couldn't because the WiFi was so slow.  The other families from our team also had similar experiences with their rooms.  We later found out that the hotel did have our team assigned to renovated rooms but gave them away to other guests who checked in before us and complained of their non-renovated rooms.  Couldn't wait to get out of this dump.  How can they even call this a resort??",-1,3,0.435802469

When he went to speak with front desk about this, it was explained that there was nothing they could do except return $200 back to him... seriously? The hidden fees are crazy. $20 a day for parking, $15 for our room fee, we got charged $50 a day for a fridge... we don't even have a fridge in our room? Also, we spent 20 minutes trying to find a parking spot because there are hardly any spots to park. Ended up having to make our own. A little ridiculous if you're going to offer 900 rooms with not enough parking.Don't waste your time with this scummy hotel. Honestly so disappointed, especially with how they handled it and how they treated a Marine.. Never will be staying at a Town and Country or any of the affiliated hotels again.

There were dirty linens outside our room, both on the sidewalk and stuck in one of the trees that were never removed over the course of our 3 day stay.Dramatic renovations are promised and assuming that the pictures reflect the end product, things will be much improved.

After you get the food you are ignored. The food is subpar and expensive including the hotel catering.  Internet bandwith is so bad it makes the internet useless and it will only cost you 10 bucks a day for that. The hotel must beleive in hiring people who will do the jobs americans won't do.

19057648,"Stayed here with a previous conference a few years back--even staying on the company's dime, I would absolutely not recommend this &quot;resort&quot; (?). See reasons below:Check-in debacle:Checked in at 10 p.m. with two young children to find out that they didn't have &quot;a room with a bed&quot; available for us until the following day. Yes, folks, there are indeed hotel rooms without beds?!?!? Not to mention that the room had been reserved for nearly two months, so what happened to our room? Okay, whatever...the kids and I are tired from being in planes and airports for the past 6 hours. Have to wait for the only bellhop in the place (yes, only one on a busy Saturday night and the place was hopping). He takes a large group off to their room--we can't walk to ours w/ our bags and a brass luggage cart because the staff &quot;can't allow guests to use them&quot; (oddly enough, they stay chained up to posts around the property). So we wait, and wait...and wait some more. The 6 minutes slowly turned into 25 minutes :( Ugh...tired, grumpy kids...Make it to the bed-less hotel room (via golf cart because it's all of a 2-minute ride and all) and they have a portable cot/bed delivered. There is a pullout sofa bed in the room, but it's so paper thin and uncomfortable that we are forced to actually rearrange heavy furniture in this room so that my youngest can sleep on two overstuffed chairs that are facing each other. Sigh...Paid $35 for two kids' buffets and 1 adult buffet for breakfast the next morning since we were all starving from our travels. The food was below par, although the service was great. I found this to be true throughout the stay. The maids and waitstaff were courteous and friendly, while the &quot;professional&quot; staff up front could learn some customer service lessons from these hardworking folks! Honestly!!!!To add insult to injury, I make it over to the supposed state-of-the-art workout facility (I can't vouch for this because I didn't actually go into it OR see anyone using it at any point in passing by) on the grounds inside of the day spa (also, not busy) to be greeted by the less-than-enthusiastic desk person by, &quot;Oh, are you staying here with a conference?&quot; I reply with, &quot;Well, yes I am.&quot; Then: &quot;Oh, they must have forgotten to tell you about the fee for use: $8/day.&quot; WHAT??? I'm paying $14 per day to park, ungodly markup on ho-hum food, overpriced (not to mention old and run-down furnishings in the) room, and now I'm nickle-and-dimed to workout??? I immediately left, of course, only to watch another fellow walk in and right back out. Who pays to use a treadmill at a hotel? I'm sure the Vagabond Inn around the corner has a free workout facility.In the end, I'm sure the management will kindly thank me for my feedback and apologetically promise to look into the issues I raised (as you've probably read in the other 150+ previous reviews). But, it's obvious to anyone and everyone reading these that the management is NOT willing to follow through with this because the same complaints would not be consistently arising. Okay, management, let's here a real game plan on turning this place around?!?!?!All in all, save your money and stay somewhere else on Hotel Circle.

18655352,"So I am sitting here in the Town &amp; Country resort room that was booked for me by my company.  I have to say that the grounds are amazing, beautiful, and well taken care of.  I wish the rooms were as well taken care of as the rooms.  The rooms are outdated, old, and need some TLC.The arm chair i'm sitting in is lumpy, and old.  So is the bed I had last night.  LUMPY and OLD.  You guys need new beds.   Every high-end hotel or even budget hotels are getting new beds these days.  Even the Comfort Inns and Quality Inns.For me, if the bed is great, than the room itself is not so important.  But, since the bed is bad, I look to other things inside the room to off-set the bad bed.  This doesn't seem to be happening.  :-(  Furniture is old and worn out.  Towels, small, and not very thirsty.TV is old, and needs more channels.  Bravo, etc...Room is NOT private at all, I am facing the parking lot with sheer curtains.  You can totally see in at night.  Not good for changing clothes or just after a shower.  I don't like closed windows, or cover windows, so this is a problem.  I asked them for a more private room, but they said that they didn't have any other rooms, and that  it would be better to call the next day.  I haven't called yet because I'm kind of settled here already, but would still entertain something else.  I asked the desk clerk last night to make a note of it, but NO ONE called me today to see if I still wanted to change.  I justed to work in hotels, and if we had a note like that, we would have called them to see if they wanted to change rooms, accommodated them, and sold their old room to someone else.  I did ask for a nicer room when we checked in.  I was educated on types of rooms from their website, and saw one I liked.  But was told the one I wanted wasn't in a good place...  Well, I am looking at 20 cars out my window right at this very moment.  Is that good?  I think it could be better.  PLUS it's loud.  People constantly walk by talking, yelling, or just making noise as they walk.  Not very relaxing.I am surprised at the spa/gym.  They charge for those.  $10/day for the gym and NO AMMENITIES. or $25 for 3 day.  I was told too, that 3 day gym &quot;membership&quot; with sauna, hot tub, and steam was $65... OUTRAGEOUS! These things should be included with the gym price - regardless.  There's an advertisement in the rooms for the Spa and gym - sounds and reads like hot tub, steam, sauna should be included.  No mention of PRICE or daily fees on the card in the room.  UGH!  And you wonder why there's no one there...  This place has 5 or so restaurants.  I went to one last night, the Terrace.  Food is diner-y.  That's okay, it was 10pm when I checked in last night.  Haven't been to any of the others yet.  I'll follow up with more later if I can.Oh, the windows don't reall open either.  they are just louvered on the outside and windows on the inside.  Not much flow through with those.  Could use another window.  or windows that OPEN.  Speaking of open windows, the A/C is horrible!  Doesn't really work.  Works similar to a swamp cooler.  Kinda cools, but not really.Anyway,  I'm in room 3250.  If you decide to stay here, just beware of the noise in this room...  VERY NOISY.Thanks!Tyler",-1,6,0.472319211

I traveled here for a conference, and while the hotel was beautifully landscaped there was nothing else to compliment- especially at $130-150/night. I tried to check-in and the front desk said that the reservations I had made in October had been deleted 2 days before my check-in (This also happened to one of the colleagues I was travelling with). I had the paperwork from my original reservations in hand so they finally relented and gave me a room. My colleague was denied a room and ended up at the Marriot across the highway (much nicer and newer anyways). The hotel is very spread out, and I dragged my luggage to a two-story building in the center of the &quot;resort&quot; - there were no elevators so I had to carry everything upstairs myself. I found an extremely dated room that looked older than I am. The room was a decent size but the walls were thin and I could hear my neighbors. Cracked tiles in the bathroom, hair on the bathroom floor, the tub handle came off everytime I tried to turn on the shower and the toilet rocked. My closet doors didn't shut all the way, and there was only one available power outlet in the room, unless I wanted to unplug the lamp in the room. The bed was hard and the comforter was so old that it was covered in fuzzies/pilled spots on the fabric. The tv was old and only got a few channels and I got to use the internet for 5 min one day out of the 6 I was there by walking to someone else's room. The hotel has wireless but it is EXTREMELY spotty and will cut off in a few minutes. The maid staff seemed nice, but were never consistent in what they left me- one day they took the bar of soap I left by the sink and never replaced it, somedays I had plenty of towels, somedays there wasn't a single washcloth in sight.  I tried the Sunshine Deli, The Cottage Cafe, Trelisses and Charlies. The staff and food at the Deli were great- they had amazing chocolate chip cookies. The Cottage Cafe was okay, Charlies was completely unaccomadating to food allergies and food allergies were hit or miss at Trelisses. We had lunch at Trelisses and had a rude waiter named Jesus who did not even try to accomadate my food allergies (no acidic foods- ie no tomatoes/citus/bell peppers- I just wanted a plain salad) he completely ignored our table and I actually had to find another waiter to get our check (I used to wait tables in college so I am usually very understanding if servers are busy or such). We went back to Trelisses another night and had a server named Jamie and she was great. I wasn't the only one who had problems- one of my other colleagues went 3 days without hot water before they would move her into another room and she missed several parts of the convention trying to wait for the maitence staff. If you want to use the gym it is $5/day and the sauna and hot tub are $25/day. We went to the concierge several times with questions, and everytime were given answers- ie. whether we could print boarding passes, get a ride somewhere, etc. I think that the only reason this hotel still gets business is that there is a conference center located on the property so it is convient for that.

The housekeeper finally left the room, BUT SHE LEFT THE DOOR TO THE ROOM OPEN!! Are you kidding me!!! This created a totally unsafe environment for my daughter. Anyone could of walked into the room!!! I am so upset that my daughter was put into this position. I called immediately on the drive home and left a message with the manager. It has been four days, and NO ONE has bothered to call me back even though my message stated that I needed to talk about a situation that happened with my 16 year old daughter during our stay. Never would I stay here again, especially if I have my children with me.",-1,8,0.310151515

First of all I arrived at the facility early at 1 pm and it was understandable my room was not ready, but the lobby was jammed packed with angry customers.  That when the red flag should have went up. I waited 5 hours for my room.  That is ridiculous,  but I was here for a convention and didn't, t have a choice, the room was booked for me. When I got to my room it was filthy. Someone had pour a red substance all over the carpet all and there was mold in the bathroom.  The furniture is very dated and worn.  The wallpaper is peeling and there are holes in the wall.  I asked for another room and I was told it would be a down grade a down grade are you kidding me.. They offered to clean it and do gave me a coupon for a free drink while they clean it.  Then I learned a $40.00  daily surcharge was being applied to my bill in case I damaged the room. Really.

224956245,"I'm not even sure where to begin. This was the absolute worst experience at a 'resort' hotel I've ever had in my life. A group of three of us were to stay 8/23/14 - 8/30/14 for a convention. The hotel looked absolutely beautiful online, and boasted about newly renovated rooms and beautiful rose gardens. It looked amazing, and I was very, very excited about coming. We booked our room (An expensive suite) back in February, because a member of our group called to tell us the rooms in the Palm Towers were going very fast.  We arrived on Saturday and came to check in, and the drive in confirmed our (high) expectations. The landscaping was gorgeous, and you drove in under several very tall palm trees. When we got to the lobby, it was packed with members of our organization checking in. We got to the front desk, got our room assignment and keys, and were on our back to the car when I I looked at the hotel map and realized we weren't in the Palm Towers. So we go back in, and the woman pretty much tells us &quot;Your reservation meant nothing, and you are sh** out of luck.&quot; They gave our suite away because it is first come first serve. What is the point in booking a room here if they give it away?! We were scheduled for Saturday, not for Friday! I have two people with me who have health issues. One has sleep apnea, and the other has two very bad legs. They aren't the smallest people in the world, either.So after being told we were sh** out of luck, and that they would put us on the &quot;priority&quot; list to be moved to the tower the next day, we went to check out our room. They put us on the side of the property, in a dingy little room, in the dark, that was no bigger than a walk in closet. The two beds were pushed very close together, there was no dresser, the TV was outdated, we had a lopsided 'straw' table, two wooden chairs, 4 coat hangers, and a very tiny bathroom that had bugs crawling around in it. We reluctantly settled in for the night. Neither of the people I was with got any sleep, whatsoever. The next morning we go down to the front desk believing that we were going to be moved, only to find out that they gave all of the rooms away - again - and that there was nothing we could do. We mentioned the bugs, and the fact that the room was like something out of a horror movie, and they 'apologized' and told us there were 20 people checking out of the tower tomorrow, and that they would put us on the priority list again. We go back to our room, reluctantly, and settle in again. They both went to sleep in the car because it was better than our room. The next morning they had a meeting so they sent me to go see what was happening with being switched to our room. I went down and they told me 'there were 14 people checking out, none of them were checking out of the tower, and there was nothing they could do. Well I was sick of it. I raised hell, told them this was bullsh** and that we needed a new room because this was posing a serious health risk for the two of my companions. I demanded to speak to a manager, who reiterated that there was nothing she could do, and I yelled at her as well. They gave us a slightly bigger room in a different building, but it's not much better. In the new building, my room and the hallway it's in is a WIFI dead zone. I'm not able to access the internet unless I walk out of my room, down the hall and to the pool, which is really annoying because I have work to do while I'm away. Every single member of our organization is disgusted by the way this hotel is ran. Members have horror stories that range from there being bugs everywhere, to filthy rooms, to moldy refrigerators, ect. The one man said he booked a suite and that when they got there, there was one bed and that the room was tiny and not at all what they wanted. To accommodate them, the hotel opened the room next door. When they went in, there was a Murphy bed (One of the old fashioned beds that you can fold out from the wall?) and that it was pulled out and unmade. The room service people are rude and many times you need to ask them to come to your room. Everybody at the front desk is rude, and the landscape of the hotel is very hard to understand. The maps they give you do nothing to explain where you are and how to get to where you need to go. We found out today that the section of the hotel where we were initially staying wasn't even open until recently. Once they knew we were having a convention here, they opened those buildings up in the hotel and must have forgot to clean it. Before that, the towers were only operational. There are only 300 rooms in each of the towers. If you are having a convention and you have a lot of people attending, do not come here. This is one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in, and we are absolutely disgusted with every aspect of the hotel and it's staff.

The &quot;resort&quot; has rooms all spread out everywhere.  When we got to our room in Bldg. 3300, we found it was extremely small.  No room in the tiny bathroom for toiletries, and for two (2) people staying for a week, only six (6) hangers, and four (4) small drawers in the &quot;entertainment stand&quot;.  At one time there was a TV in the entertainment stand, but now there is none, and it is used for a dresser.  Oh, did I say four (4) small drawers to put your clothes in.  We finally had to either lay things out in the closet, or not empty the suitcase.  They have place a flat screen on top of the entertainment stand.  The second evening at 7 PM, the TV remote control stopped working.  A call to the front desk was put me on hold for 15 minutes.  Ratyher than continue to wait, I took the remote to the lobby.  The front desk clerk did not apologize but said I'll call it in.  When I returned to the room, the remote started working, and when Housekeeping called, rather than saying we'll either swap it out or fix it, I got &quot;oh it's working, OK&quot;.  It stopped working again 15 minutes later, and I called the front desk at 8 PM to report it.  The front desk clerk said she would report it.  At 10 PM we called Housekeeping and they said someone would come fix it.  45 minutes later we contacted the front desk and let them know that no one had come, and it was late and don't send anyone to our room that night.  The next morning we called Housekeeping at 6 AM to report the problem again.  We told them we would not be in the room, and they said they would send someone to swap it out while we were gone.  We returned to the room at noon, and it still had not been fixed.  Another trip to the front desk, and the clerk said he would report it.  He had a &quot;I don't care attitude&quot;.

We asked to be moved but they said they were sold out, yet we kept walking by empty rooms every day. The carpets had a grime on them, I wore my shoes at all times. The beds were clean enough. We had to keep the air conditioner on so it would circulate the air, I was having a hard time with my asthma in our room so the A/C seemed to help a bit. On the plus side... The staff who greeted us when we arrived were kind. Although they had 1 person booking people in, and there was a line of about 6-7 people.

If you want help from the front desk, the phone will ring for as long as 10 minutes before being answered. Although the grounds are beautiful, the carpets in the rooms are old and stained.

I'm under the impression there are some changes and new management, but that doesn't change the fact that this place is beyond old and outdated and smells pretty bad. It smells old, musty, dank.. and in some places, of smoke. The set-up is confusing, and if you're not in one of the towers, it may stake a few times before you finally figure out how to navigate the grounds.The rooms are so outdated and just scary. I can't believe I slept on that box of a mattress. Not much rest happening here... as nothing was comfortable.Line for check-in was about a 30 minute wait, because of course they'd be understaffed while they have 2 events going on at the hotel. If you're in your room, don't bother calling the front desk. You have to trek your way back to the lobby (to maybe wait on a line again).Food options were ridiculously bad. One of the places is only open for breakfast and early lunch, as it closes at 2.. and charges $15 for a crappy buffet restaurant.

58372039,"I stayed at the Town and Country for seven days during a conference that was being held there. Before I left for my trip several colleagues mentioned that it may be best to look elsewhere for accommodations, but I decided for the convenience aspect, I'd keep my reservation. Big mistake.My (first) room was in the Regency Tower. Stepping off the elevator at my floor I noticed the smell of urine (!!) and walked past fresh gum on the carpet which also looked as if it hadn't been vacuumed in a week. The decor was awful - who's idea is it to add blue carpet, a scary picture of a little girl on the wall (this picture was also in my second room in the Royal Palm tower) and curtains that date back to the 70's? After one night in this room I requested a move to the Royal Palm Tower, similar decor but a step up nonetheless.I thought about switching to one of the other hotels in the circle (there are MANY other options), but was told that it I would be charged $50-75 PER NIGHT of my unused stay if I wished to cancel. This made no sense especially since the hotel was at capacity and was even turning folks away due to lack of roms. I've never been at a hotel that enacted such a policy. Ridiculous.Be aware that this is 'nickel and dime' CENTRAL! Everything is extra so be prepared to pay for the gym ($8-10/day - only open until 8pm and the air was stagnant, no A/C or fans) and to use the internet ($9.95-12.95 per day). Several of the front desk staff were incredibly rude (When asked about internet my companion was told - 'Please wait until I'm finished and I'll answer your question'). I frequented the Terrace Cafe for breakfast and lunch and several times sat for 10 or more minutes before anyone came by to take my order or refill my drink. To avoid this, I would stop next door at the Deli to grab a Starbucks-type coffee and each morning the line was so long that it would take 15-30 minutes of standing in line to get a drink. (I blame the management for this one since they only had 1 staff behind the counter between 7am and 11am). If I were ever in the area again, I would stay at the Courtyard Marriott where the rooms were cheaper, the gym was free, there was hot complimentary breakfast, and you received $20 in coupons per day good for any food/drink at the hotel - and it's only a 5 minute walk to the Town and Country.

The room is $149 in the main building. For that price, I don't think it's worth it. This is a motel 6 type hotel. The reason they can set the price so high, it's because they host so many group events. For your individual travelers, don't stay there!!!

We were in a stinky and small room, but located adjacent to pool and ice so we could go somewhere nicer than our room. Rooms were not cleaned very thoroughly...our ice bucket sat for days w/water in it until WE finally emptied it! We often did not receive washcloths with our towels and rarely received bath mats.

We complained and were told someone would fix it. We never saw anyone come fix it, but it did drain better, however, we still stood in our shower water - just not as deep as previously/ We also found short, wiry hairs and nail clippings on the night stand between the beds, as if someone shaved in the mirror above the nights stand and let their clippings fall.

We drove from Las Vegas and upon arriving at about 3PM, we found it very difficult to even find where to go to register once on the property.  After about a 30 minute wait to check in my husband and I were fortunate to get our room right away as others we overheard had to wait until their rooms were &quot;prepared&quot;.  We booked and were promised a king size bed, but when we got to the room it had two double beds!  Fearing having to wait a long time for another room, we just opted to stayed there.  When my friends from the convention and I tried to get a meal Thursday night, we went to one of the three restaurants on property and the lines were horrendous.  KNOWING months if not a year or more in advance that a group of over 2000 would be staying and EATING on property, you'd think they would have hired extra waitstaff to accommodate the crush of diners that would descend on the places to eat for breakfast, lunch and dinner times.  Not the case.  We had to wait long times to even get a table, then we had to bus it ourselves from the last diners, and there was an even longer wait to get a menu and even longer to get served and get the check.  PPPlanning if you ask me.  They could have had a few extras to work the shifts they knew would be swamped but they opted not to. So we had to wait.The grounds were very beautiful I'm sure in their prime, but many of the roses were dead or dried up and it was a LONG walk from the first room we were in to the convention center and I got lost coming back every time!  SIGNAGE other than big maps would have helped a lot!   Speaking of rooms, the first room we got with the two beds was clean but very tiny and cramped with an old TV.  There was a gap under and down the side of the door that was at least an inch and a half all around that let the sun in and the noise and the cigarette and CIGAR smoke from our very inconsiderate neighbors.  We called the front desk to confirm that we were in NON SMOKING rooms and the very helping receptionist confirmed that indeed they were non smoking.  We asked the neighbor to move down or to please not smoke in front of their room as the smoke came right into our room.  The woman did move down a bit.  The husband told us to &quot;put a towel under the door!&quot;  HOW RUDE!!  My husband had throat cancer and the last thing he needs to be around is smoke blowing directly in his room!  My husband called maintainance to see if they could fix the door.  They seemed very concerned and sounded like they would take care of it.  Filled out a report and everything.  Nothing happenend.  The next day when the man was smoking his cigar in a chair on the deck of the walkway in front of our rooms, I asked his very nicely to please not smoke. I told him it was a non smoking building and asked he if could possible move away from the door.  Again he was very rude and refused to stop or move.  Finally my husband called the security who drove by but said nothing to the man, the finally the manager who was very helpful and got us moved to a much nicer room for our last night.  It had a king sized bed and was in the newer tower building (but on the first floor) right next to the convention center where my activities were.  It was a great room, two sinks, a desk, a table and chair, a lounge chair and  a patio that led to the pool and hot tub.  It made the last night much more tolerable.The walk to the Mall was pleasant and we did that a couple times, but I don't think they'll ever have to worry aout us staying at the Town and Country Resort again!

I respond to the desk and get a new room. I remove the blankets from the king bed...guess what...the same deal; the sheets are 12&quot; too short for the mattress. The TV didn't work either...but there was heat this time, if you could make it across the floor for the broken glass left by housekeeping.Oh, BTW, a door prize of a two-day stay at the Town &amp; Country Hotel is refused by the gentleman whose name is called.

Well, it was. I arrived about 10:30pm to check in after a long day of travel. The room they had me in at first was not only dirty, it was also on the ground level with an exterior door and two full screen windows that couldn't be effectively locked. As a woman traveling alone, I immediately went back to the desk and requested a new room. This one was at the back of the premises in a dilapidated, dark and damp building with no security or front desk. There were stains on every towel, and the sheets. There was also a huge stain on the carpet. I ordered room service twice during my four day stay and the trays stayed there for over a day each time. The food itself wasn't great, but at least it wasn't terrible. Luckily, there's a huge mall across the street that I ended up spending most of my free time at.  What's sad is that you can tell that this hotel was originally nice. A lot of time and money must have been spent building that hotel.

I know that I booked for Saturday, June 21, and they messed up the date of my booking!So they got my reservation date wrong, charged my card in full, and then when I ask if there are any other rooms available for us that evening, they tell me no, they are completely full.

My first inclination that things might not be very good was during check in when the front desk stated that since I booked through Hotwire I would be getting a room in a specific building.  However, I was offered an upgrade for $40 which I declined.  After checking in to my room, (which was adequately clean but equal in comfort an amenities to a budget hotel, certainly not what I would expect from one rated at 3.5 stars), my wife and I attempted to get dinner and drinks at the onsite restaurant, Charlie's.  The host, Nicholas, caused to us to wait an inordinate amount of time to be seated while he conversed with multiple employees, all the wile glancing up to verify if we were still there. My wife and I chose to eat off property instead.  As we were walking away, he finally came and inquired if we could be helped.  I informed him that we were going elsewhere due to the unacceptable wait time.  He was very rude at that point after which I asked for a manager, to which he informed me that he was the manager.  I immediately called the front desk and informed them of his rudeness.  The following morning I noticed that they had put authorization on my account for $56 and $59 when I was informed it would only be a $40 deposit.  I went outside (only to smell the pungent aroma of marijuana being smoked, which I also reported) and headed to the front desk to inquire.  I was informed that it was an error and would be cleared up the next business day.  I checked out, went about my day and received an email with the invoice.  Dollar amount was correct, so I double checked my account to see if it had been taken out.  Imagine my surprise when I find another $79 authorization holding funds on my account placed after I checked out. I did speak with the front desk supervisor who could not explain the mulitple auths, but being a holiday weekend they said they could not do anything because the banks were closed.

Our arrival was great, the bell person (whomever that is that greets your car) was very observant and read the name tags on our luggage and addressed us by name when he opened the cab door - nice touch.  Check in went ok, just normal.  Stayed in the one story older rooms (3252).  First off exhaust fan did not work upon our arrival, call to maintenance...they showed up timely and replaced the fan.  Later go to iron some clothes, added water to the iron...it just pours out through the holes, ok, now call housekeeping to get an replacement iron.

If I had to judge the entire experience by this hotel alone (which I won't), then this place is a poor representation to tourists. I would never suggest this place to anyone. The place is huge! Lots of tropical foliage and flowers to enjoy. The property itself is well maintained; the pool and lounge areas were clean and inviting. However, from the front lobby to the tallest tower of rooms is about a half mile walk! Not fun with luggage and no one offered to drive me to the room! Upon a closer look, the tower itself looked like an old brick summer camp building. The room was dated with over-the-top gold gilded decor. There is a Starbucks on the property, but their espresso machine was broken the entire 4 days I was there, so they could only serve coffee. The breakfast buffet in the restaurant was bland and luke warm, and it costs $11.95 - it was equivalent to the free breakfast you get at Holiday Inn, but I think that at least is hot and tastes better. The wait staff is also poor. At breakfast, I had to ask for a spoon, creamer, sugar, and refills - none of which was brought at the same time or before my coffee got cold. At dinner, I sat at my table for 20 minutes when I was done with no drink refill and no check because my waiter was on a break and no one else was covering. And the restaurant wasn't even busy. Internet service only worked the first night and was down the rest of the time! And yet they had tacked it on my bill for every night I was there. At checkout, they removed the charges for when it didn't work. I asked them to also remove it for the first night for my inconvenience. The front desk manager argued with me about it - a charge that was only $7.95! I asked her why then was she trying to charge me for it every night when it didn't work, for which she had no answer except she had removed those charges so it didn't matter. She didn't even say thank you and pretty much topped the whole experience for me which is why I'm even bothering with this review. I was here for a trade show that was on site, so it was convenient to be here for work and there was a show rate for the room. Other people at the trade show who I spoke to also had complaints about their room and experience which they shared with me.

I had asked if we can switch rooms the following day if a guest checked out from a tower room. He said yes and wrote down our information. I also asked if there was a fee for the switch of rooms and he told me No. When we booked the room, it was advertised with free breakfast like previous years. When we finished getting checked in, I asked about our breakfast pass and was told that our reservation didn't include that. I told him that when we reserved our room It said free breakfast, he just looked at me and said that we could pay for it and it was $15 per person. I said no Thank you and left disappointed. We go to our room and it looked ok. There was a funky smell when we turned on the A/C. The next morning before we left to the convention i called the front desk to ask for any available rooms. The person said there is one but there was a fee for it. I said oh really, i explained to her about the gentleman who told us it was going to be free and no extra charges. She said no, and it was going to be $15 to $80 a night for the change. i told her never mind, and requested a refrigerator. She said it was going to be $15 a day. I said no and hanged up. I was just so confused with all these lies and deception from the staff. After that we really wanted to leave and go to another place. But we knew with the convention going on it was going to be impossible and expensive. So we stayed and tried to enjoy the rest of our trip. When we went to the front desk to check out on Sunday morning the gentleman who helped us at check in assisted us again. I had told him about what happened with the room and all he said was sorry. So when we were waiting for our receipt he told us we had a charge of $28 for parking. I told him No since he gave us a free parking pass. He looked at me like if i was lying to him and told me to bring him the pass. So we left to pick up the pass and walked back to the front desk. But when we arrived he saw us and left to the back room. So the next person who assisted us was really nice and kind and she deducted the parking fee for us. So overall, after this visit. I don't think we will be coming back to this hotel. I understand they have to cater to other guest.

I was looking for a place to stay in San Diego for my bachelor party weekend for a single night and the deal with tax and everything was about $177. That seemed like a good price for a place to stay in San Diego, and at a Resort! No question, I was buying the deal... So it seems because of the size of the property it is considered a resort. But when I think of &quot;Resort&quot; (Because I've stayed at many) I think of upgraded amenities and more available things to do. When we got there Saturday night at about 9:45PM, I asked about the pool and spa situation. Closed at 10PM, no &quot;Resort&quot; I've been to prior had the pool and spa close any earlier than midnight. (I wouldn't normally care that much, but that was a long day prior to arrival and we were really looking forward to sitting and relaxing in the hot tub). Oh well moving on right... Oh here is the resort fee... and here is the parking fee... REALLY?! Pay you to stay here, but then my vehicle is like a separate guest? Rubbed me a little wrong there... Okay whatever at least we're at a &quot;Resort&quot;, we'll be comfortable in the room at least... HA! This room had what seemed to be the first light fixtures ever mass produced and the wallpaper was a rare breed of nursing home mixed with better homes and gardens magazine. We stayed at a Motel 6 the night prior because we were trying to conserve cash, and that cheap motel put the &quot;Resort&quot; to shame by a long shot. I don't know if we got put in the suck zone of the &quot;Resort&quot; with a broken ice machine and had to park on the sidewalk because there was no parking near our building (Good thing I paid for that), because we got a deal online, or if everyone else was just as lucky in these swell accommodations. All we could do was laugh and joke about this glorious &quot;Resort&quot; while we were there and make fun of the extra fees for staying at a &quot;Resort&quot;.

Which was not remotely close to my room. What did i pay for? When i entered mo room the first thing i noticed was that it looked nothing like the room i was lead to believe i reserved based on their VERY misleading website. The room i recieved was tiny, dirty, smelly, and very uncomfortable. The television in the room was a step down from ones you may find on the side of the road. Dealing with the staff was an absolute NIGHTMARE! At one point during my stay i needed some towels. I after multiple hours and many phone calls where staff promised me the towels were on their way, I walked down to the pool and got the towels myself. Through out the remainder of my stay i wondered if my towels might show up but they never did. The people in the room next door ordered room service and left their dirty dishes out on the balcony. They are most likely still sitting there collecting bugs.

Be aware the website shows several pictures which appear to be resort like, however its far from that! We were first checked in to the 3200's room but upon entering the room we were overwhelmed with a strong odor of bleach, the room was dirty with mold on the lamp shade. We voiced our concern to the manager who sent a gentleman to let us look at a different room which was the size of a closet and had a bad odor as well. We then decided to talk to the manager yet again where we voiced our concerns and said that we either want a refund or to be in a room that is not in the condition of the first two we seen. At first the manager was reluctant but after letting her know that this is unnaceptable especially when their website shows photos and details that dont even represent the &quot;resort&quot; in the slightest bit.  The manager stated that she will give us a tower room that is usually more expensive but nicer in hopes that we will stay there again. We decided to give it a shot and found that the room was much nicer than the first two we looked at however it was the equivalent to a super 8 room!

We ate Dinner one noght in the Sports Bar and Grill and I have never been treated so rudely by a waitress. Very unfriendly, did not smile once, never came by and asked how our food was or asked for drink refills. We asked her a question about the menu and we received a very sarcastic attitude back. then the room we stayed in was nice it had a door with access outside to the pool. But the A/C and heater unit had no knob to choose air or heat, so u just turn it on and all night it gets really cold then really hot. Every morning me and my daughter woke up with stuffy noses and sore throats. It was very uncomfortable. Addressed my concerns to the Front Desk at check out but they just seemed to brush it off. So for the price per night which was $129, was very overpriced. Definitely would not stay there again. Very disappointed, especially saying that we stayed there 4 nights.",-1,0,0.629100529

The bathrooms remind you of your grandmother's bathroom -- only one person can fit in there, and hubby had to leave his toiletries on the dresser because there was no shelf space.  But even worst were the paper-thin walls.  The parking spaces are very close to the rooms (with single-pane glass in the large windows), so you constantly hear car doors slamming and moms yelling at kids to hurry up and get in the car.  Once in the room, you'll hear your neighbor's TV set, and mom yelling at the kids to hurry up and get ready for bed.  We were there for a business conference, but we definitely felt like we were on a hellish family vacation from the 1970s.  The restaurants were expensive, slow, and had so-so food that also tasted like it was made by Betty Crocker.  Finally, we had high hopes for using the bus and trolley station nearby, but they run so infrequently, we ended up taking (expensive) cabs everywhere.

I asked to be switched and they put me in a part of the hotel that was so outdated, I literally expected the guy from Fantasy Island to come out and greet me. All jokes aside, when I got into my room, it was filled with a musty and unpleasant scent, and had this creepy painting that just seemed... well a strange choice. The redeeming qualities could be found in the friendliness of the staff, from the Trellises and the responsiveness of the event AV guys during my lecture.

The signage in the hotel is limited and confusing, and I got lost more than once - and noticed others also getting lost.The staff that I came into contact with were really friendly, but not in any great rush to get things done with the quickness or professional levels as I have come to expect when away on business trips.

21232780,"The Town and Country Resort hotel is a sprawling mess of a hotel complex.  There are modern towers and quaint bungalows spread out across the vast acreage.  There are also some  extremely average old, apartment-style rooms sprinkled into the mix.  Unfortunately, I got one of those rooms in October 2008. For the privilege of staying in room #3714, I paid $169 for a Saturday night and $189 for a Sunday night. One earlier reviewer said this was &quot;Motel rooms at hotel prices&quot; and I think that nails it on the head.  The hotel complex is so huge that you need a printed map to figure out where you are and where you're going and there are also maps with the familiar &quot;you are here&quot; arrow spread out over the grounds.  My room was quite difficult to find, due mainly to the fact that the well-meaning but clueless young woman on the front desk who checked me in told me the room was on the first floor when it was indeed on the SECOND FLOOR instead. Whoops! Strike one.  The room, once I found it, was very average. The bedroom and bathroom felt small and cramped. The bed was very comfortable, though although the bedspread and room decorations were old and tired. It had an old, small TV and the balcony looked out to the back side of one of the many meeting and convention facilities on the &quot;Resort&quot; property.  I put &quot;Resort&quot; in quotes because, even though there are a few nice areas of the hotel complex, I felt that the room I got stuck with dispelled the notion that I was at a resort.  The &quot;view&quot; was a joke, unless you like looking at the back side of another building ten feet away.   I heard a great deal of noise from the rooms next door and below me, and even more noise from the hotel's maintenance, landscaping and housekeeping staffs wheeling their carts right outside.    I had stayed at this hotel several years ago and stayed in one of the Towers, which made a great deal of difference. I enjoyed that stay a lot more than I enjoyed this one.  This is not to say my stay this year was a total loss. The T&amp;C is quite close to the Trolley line that runs east-west and is quite convenient to travel around San Diego.  There's a mediocre but serviceable golf course next door and a great deal of shopping available in Mission Valley.  The T&amp;C property does have a couple of pools, but some of them are much nicer than others. The one near the lobby and one of the resort's restaurants is decent, but the one outside one of the towers is quite noisy, and there's another small pool in the courtyard of one series of rooms that reminded me of a Motel 6.  Not all was average here: I enjoyed two wonderful breakfasts sitting in the San Diego sunshine outside the Trellises restaurant.

The carpeting was buckling in places and needed cleaned.  Everything looked and felt old and worn out.  The walls are very thin.  Every time the phone rang next door, we heard it. We also heard them use the toilet, shower and blow dry their hair.  Like they were in our room.  It was very loud.  The shower was ok but the head was placed very low on the wall.  The bathroom appeared clean and maintained.  There was a sink in with the shower and one in the entry way that made it easy for me to get ready while my husband showered.  Towels were rough and unforgiving.  The one thing this place has going for it is that the Fashion Valley Transit Station is behind the parking lot.  It was very easy to get to SDCC every morning.

The day I arrived they couldnt give me my booking as they were booked out so we were put in a room with one queen bed on the 4th floor and the bed was a pulldown bed from the wall at 209.00 a night. There was an adjoining door with the room next door and even quiet talk we might as well as of been sitting with each other on the sofa cause you could hear every word said.  The bed was really old as were the pillows god knew when they had last been replaced there wasn't much stuffing left in them at all.  We did ask for more but they were as bad as the ones we already had. the couple above us like to have sex 100 times a night and there is no insulation so lets just say they might as well be laying beside us we could hear every single movement. It was so noisy at night people running down the hallways etc.  One night they rented out one of the rooms for an event and we had to listen to the loud music played there till 10.30pm at night.  When we complained was told there was nothing they could do as it was booked out for them till 10.30pm. We had booked for 10 nights but we left two days early as we could just not take the noise the uncomfortable bed anymore.  I was charged fully for the room for the two nights we did not stay plus and extra $100.00 per night for leaving early.  After 3 international phone calls at my own expensive I am still fighting with them to get this money refunded as they say it is their policy to charge for early departure.  They staff were not friendly at all and have been down right rude at trying to get our money back.

Another business partner ended up checking out a day early because she requested a non smoking room due to health issues the rooms around her were all smoking room and she said it came through the vents and she got really sick. Another business partner found bugs in her room. All in all this was a horrible experience and I would never go back or reccomend it.

It looks like a few  50 year old country motels , with a high tower and a some random buildings. It is quaint, the flowers are nice and there are cute streets and welll â¦ So I get to the two story building, no elevators. But its all good, I donât need one. The hallways are inside  and dark,  first floor is filled with students -the doors are open and its LOUD. A woman is screaming at them to hurry up. ( oh no Iâm thinking) My room is on the second floor. A well dressed older European couple and I offer wary looks. I open the door to the worst MUSTY - OLD carpet smell.  The carpet is blue and probably really old , the fabric on the bedspread thread worn. The smell is overwhelming. I phone the front desk. Oh she says , yes some âpeople complain about that building âBack to the front desk , back in line and a new key. &lt; I did hear one woman exclaim to another about her four poster bed in the room - I was hopeful) My next room is set at the end of the property . There is an alley way leading to somewhere near the freeway which I can hear very plainly. The out side is kinda funky cute, well worn white paint cute terrace of flowers. I can do funky , even thread worn if its clean.. Inside the room with two double beds smells like old unwashed clothes. Gross. The carpet is really stained , a white chalking smear is on one of the bed covers. A glass on a plastic tray is shining sticky. The fabric lampshades are whiteish grey and dusty. There is a dead bug enclosed in the picture frame directly over the bed. Looks like a tic. I pull back the covers and a black curly hair is laying on the sheet.  The other bed looks clean so I fold away the cover and wash my hands. I wish I would have had my camera. On a happy note the bathroom is clean. Except for the wall next to the toilet where there are some dried brown drips. Iâm thinking a spray bottle of cleaner , paper towels and buying some sheets will get me thru the week.In the middle of the night I hear the freeway and the guy next door snoring.

If you book rooms for someone - do them a favor and book somewhere else. Right across the street are the Hilton, residence inn , Sheraton , double tree ..

The double beds were harder than boards, and the furniture appeared to be out of something from a &quot;Golden Girls&quot; episode! The bathroom was so tiny, you could not use the toilet without the door literally in your face or the shower curtain hanging off your head! The fixtures were outdated, the TV had little or no signal (of course, 10 years old!), and there were so many stains on the lamp shades that I thought it was a &quot;patterned&quot; shade at first!

647253152,"This was pretty much the worst experience Iâve ever had at a hotel anywhere in the world.  I had booked for only one night to avoid jet-lagged driving; I had flown in from abroad and wanted to stay the night near the airport before driving another 45 minutes away for a family emergency.  I should have just made the drive.  From the time I checked in (around 10pm) to the time I finally reached my room was over an hour.  Secondly, I was told untruths by the front desk staff.  This hotel is a vast complex with many buildings.  At night it is nearly impossible to figure out where you are and find your building.  There is very little signage to guide you.  One âmapâ I found was high up, too small to read, particularly at night.  There is no lighting.  I parked twice and tried to walk, with my luggage, to my room and both times was in the wrong place.  When I finally found my building (âGarden Buildingâ) there was no parking.  It was dark and late.  I went back to the front desk to request a room in a building where there was parking.  I was told the first untruth, âthere are no other rooms, we are fully booked.â I was given no help and was shrugged off.  The only person who helped me was the woman at the gate (Karen) who, seeing my distress, gave me very specific instructions of where to park (some 8 minutes walk to my building).  When I finally reached my âGarden Buildingâ at 11:15 pm, the signage did not indicate where my room was.  After wandering around unsuccessfully for a few minutes a golf cart driver helping someone else told me roughly where to go to find my room.  Frantic to check on my family emergency situation, I tried to get on email.  Second untruth, that the hotel provides Internet.  I called the front desk.  They said they could move me to another room âwith Internetâ (wasnât I told that the place was fully booked and there were no rooms available? Wasnât I told upon check-in that the hotel has Internet and what the serverâs name was?).  I was too exhausted and upset to make the walk back to my car, with the luggage, and go through another lengthy attempt to find yet another building and parking.  I stayed only 7 hours.  The room was adequate but hardly worth what I paid.  The bathroom was clean but quite old.  The furniture seems to be a mish mosh of unwanted, beat-up items, so they were stuffed into this small room; it was difficult to maneuver in the small room with the large and unwieldy pieces of heavy wood dressers.  How could two people manage in this room? Among all this furniture, however, there is no desk and nowhere to put your suitcase.  I had to put mine on the floor, further making maneuvering around the room unmanageable.I have no idea what the rooms in the rest of the complex are like, but do not expect to get what you pay for.  In addition, parking is $20 per night, for the privilege of parking very far from your room, and through dark streets and walkways with luggage (lovely if you are a single woman). This raises the final, possible, untruth.  Upon check-in I was told I would owe $20 for parking.  At check-out they said âno charge.â  I fully expect to see my credit card charged after all, but weâll see. I am submitting this review amid the process of moving a loved one into hospice.

We told him we want our original booked room but the guy insisting there's no room available as they're fully booked.  Since we only intended to stay one night for the Music Convention the next day, we opted to stay.  We drop our luggage in the room and went out to grab a bite to eat and when we return to the room to rest for the night, the carpet was all wet.

We decided to walk to the front desk and talk to one of the front desk person's Lupe Lopez.  We told her our situation, she insist housekeeping can clean the wetness.  I ask her so you would expect all four of us to wait outside of the room at 9:30 PM for housekeeping to come and blow dry the room? Does that look like a way you want to treat your guess?  How would you feel if you check in a hotel with your family in a same situation? She responded there's no other room available and she would not know what to do...do you want to check out?

However the location is not great as unless you want to shop you are spending time at the resort as there is not much around but highways and other hotels. The resort is old, outdated and in desperate need of a major renovation. If you are planning to stay here one night as you are passing through then maybe this hotel could work. If you are planning on being there for a length of time for a vacation or a conference then you must be warned. The rooms are extremely old with mouldy and cracked tiles on the deck and in the bathroom. The furniture in the room is very dated and showing wear and tear.The curtains are yellowing and overall the rooms feels dirty. The beds are hard and the bedding was old. As a group of us were there together we were able to see that not all rooms were alike so it would be difficult to request a room. It seemed like they had bought a mish mash of furniture at a garage sale to put into the rooms. The resort itself is also very old. There was one very small heated pool and hot tub. However no towels are provided and the lounge chairs are also old and uncomfortable. The restaurant was also dated and dirty. The floors were greasy and the tables sticky, The food was terrible!!! Actually uneatable. We were there for four nights so were stuck eating there and each time the food was bad. If you go eat across the street at the fashion mall as there is restaurants there. Also do not spend the extra money on the breakfast buffet as all it consists of is bacon, scrambled eggs, stale pastries and hash browns and one drink of your choice.San Diego is a beautiful place and there are so many other places to stay.

5981519,"This resort caters to conferences and conventions.  It also tries to position itself as a place that is convenient for families.  The old tagline is to pick one thing and do it well... T&amp;C should heed that advice.  After reading other TripAdvisor postings, I can see how there are so many different feelings about the same property. I've broken my review into a few sections to help you consider the property:Check-inCheck-in is hit or miss.  I sailed right through with an early arrival (10:30am) and they were very helpful.  A colleague arrived at 11:30am and had to wait four almost 5 hours... they kept saying a room would be ready on the hour... only to keep repeating that every hour until 4pm.  Bumped?The hotel has around 1,000 rooms.  Apparently they often overbook, and I knew several people who got bumped to the Red Lion down the street because they didn't have any rooms upon arrival. Pick a themeThe property is an interesting mix - part palm jungle, part rose garden and lots of concrete.  There are little areas around the property to sit down, but they seemed to be inexpensive benches that weren't very sturdy.  Kind of like whatever company had a closeout on benches at the time, they bought many and put them everywhere.  Most seemed like they needed a cleaning and a new layer of paint.  Suggested RoomsThe property is kind of a wierd mix of styles - doubt this property ever had much of a master plan.  There are small (1-3 story) units that are wood structures with cedar shake roofs.  Then there is a Regency Tower that is about 8-9 stories, and a Royal Palm Tower that is about 12-14 stories tall.  I was given a room in a two story unit - not bad size, though the pick a property theme continued - lots of 1970's wall paper with dark blue carpet and colonial style furniture.  My room had seen better days - although it was a good size, it was pretty musty smelling.  Some colleagues were assigned rooms in the Regency Tower, and mentioned it too had a lot to be desired.  I heard best comments about the Royal Palm Tower, though a colleague mentioned his room was quite small and even had a Murphy bed.  Yep, that was the only bed in the room.  Wierd.RestaurantsAte mostly at the Terrace Cafe.  Breakfast buffet for around $13, though seemed pretty tame - nothing special and seemed like it used the 99 cent sausages and frozen hash brown potatoes.  It is open to midnight, so not a bad place if you need a sandwich later in the evening.  Adjacent is the Sunshine Deli - home of pre-made sandwiches and salads for $8-12.  Adjacent FoodRight behind the property is the Trolley Station and the Fashion Valley Mall.  Fashion Valley is an open air mall, and has a good mix of retail (JCPenney to Saks, Macy's to Nordstrom) and a nice food court (Rubio's Mexican, Chinese, Hamburgers, etc).  It also had a Pizzeria Uno restaurant, and a PF Chang's and Cheesecake Factory just north of the mall (on the mall property but just beyond the main central walkway to the north near the parking areas).  There are lots of maps so you can find your way around the FV Mall.  If you have time, take a walk (easy pathways, sidewalks &amp; crosswalks) to the mall for better menu selection and prices.  Taxi'sMy fare was about $23 to the property.  Apparently the pathway from the airport to I-5 is a wierd route, and many people thought their cab driver was running up the fare using side streets to get to I-5.  I later learned this is the main route, so don't fear if it seems like it's a strange way.  The hotel often has shuttles stopping by for return trips to the airport - $10-15 one way.  Shuttles - good news is that there aren't many hotels between here and the airport for them to stop at, so most of the time I understand it's a direct run to the airport from the hotel (as in my case). Spa/WorkoutTook a tour - seemed nice, though it's around $8 a day if you want to use the workout room.  Quite small for a 1000 room property, so when a convention is on site, it is often packed full with wait times for each piece of equipment.  General FacilitiesSeemed like a time warp in some areas - some of the restrooms in the convention area were modern and nice, others were tiny and worn.  I understand the convention facilities were the only ones in the area in - you guessed it - the 1960's, so be ready to go back in time.  While ok from a distance, when you get close or look with a purpose, you see dirty ceilings, funky light fixtures and what appears to be lots of cosmetic work to dress up a very tired facility.  In some places it works ok, in others it seems as effective as putting lipstick on a pig.  Be careful around the convention area - the load in area for the exhibit hall is right in the path to the facility for convention participants.  A few times the forklifts almost took me out with their long forks and somewhat inattentive drivers.Check-outAfter a convention, it's chaotic in the lobby.  Check-out time is 11am, so if you have a later flight, you can hold your luggage at the bell station.  *NOTE* If you have a laptop, they WILL NOT take the laptop with the rest of the bags.  I asked if I could sign something that would waive any damage - no way.  I was stuck - until I asked at the front desk and learned they had a few (2-3) larger safe boxes.  If they are available, you can put your laptop in there for safekeeping (I had to find that out on my own - would have been nice if the bell station would have offered this option).  Otherwise, you are out of luck and hauling that around.  Bottom LineIf you get assigned here for a conference, aim for the Royal Palm Tower if a more modern room (for this property) is important.  If you want quiet and can stand a musty smell, aim for a smaller unit on the property and keep the fan or a/c running to move the air around.  If you get a good price and need a convenient location for San Diego attractions and all you need is a bed, this could work - though I'd really check out other properties in the same price range.",-1,4,0.480083468
5948457,"I have to say that I must agree with the terrible reviews of this place.  It has got to be one of THE worst &quot;hotels&quot; I have ever had the displeasure of staying.  Out of no choice of my own, our school district booked it for a conference that I was attending in July.  (The conference hall, which is part of the Town and Country, is a step up from the rest of the hotel).I'll begin with the total disorganization in the lobby during check-in...  Granted, there were a zillion teachers and other guests swarmed in the lobby, but one would think that by now management would have implemented some sort of organized procedure for handling guests at such high volumes.  No one seemed to know what was going on and the times we were told our rooms would be ready varied from one staff person to another. As we trekked through the overgrown jungle-like walkways to get to a restaurant for breakfast, we landed upon a low-class version of a cafe.  It looked like some sort of side of the highway Jerry's Restaurant from the 1960s.  After standing in a line that went out the door, we were seated at separate tables (not a big deal, since there were 9 of us).  However, after waiting forever I was hoping for a meal that was at least somewhat palatable.  I'm not sure how you go wrong with a cheese omlet and potatoes, but they managed to.  The potatoes were charred and the omlet was grey - everything tasted like a piece of charcoal!  Yuck!!  After two bites, I paid my twelve dollars and easily convinced the rest of our group never to dine here again.  I've never paid so much for such a disgusting meal.  Several hours later we had a room.  With all of the money that they get from ripping people off, I don't see how they can't afford to update the place.  The rooms were dark, dirty, old, and just plain old creepy.  They have this bizarre old Victorian thing going on as their decor.  The bathrooms have peeling wall paper and the shower doesn't seem to have been scrubbed since they built the hotel.  There were special hairs in my bed and on a few &quot;clean&quot; towels.  Yes, the special kind that you keep down under. The toilet backed up even after having someone come in and &quot;fix&quot; it.  The walls are paper thin.  We could hear our neighbors brushing their teeth and unfortunately for us, we got to smell their cigarette smoke all night and morning while in the room.  Haven't they heard of separating smoking floors from non-smoking floors???  I've read several reviews about the beautiful grounds and pools.  Not true...  Unless you consider gardens littered in trash and worn down pools littered with seedy characters everywhere beautiful.  This &quot;hotel&quot; couldn't have gotten things more wrong.  They need to shut down and renovate every inch of this property.  Perhaps back in the 1950s or 60s this place was of resort quality, but it has since been flushed to sewer quality.

We were also told by one of the guests who studied Art History that the painting of the girl is studied in Art History classes because shortly after the painting was commissioned the young girl committed suicide.  The staff very openly hate working there so there is little customer service offered.  I do not recommend this hotel.

If you are traveling with family or on a pleasure trip, many other hotels offer much more in the San Diego area without having to worry that 10,000 conventioneers might come clogging up the lobby or restaurants around you. For the rooms at the hotel, they were always very clean, but not top quality.  The sheets and bed, the towels and customer service were no better than a Motel 6 (about 100 less a night on the same block). The hotel has two major types of rooms - tower and garden rooms. The tower rooms have the advantage of being larger and having balconies. The balconies, because there is not much to look at outside the hotel all face in toward the pools so everyone can look at each other - not my preference. There is a large mall that is within walking distance, but not much else.  Everything seems to be within a short drive - downtown, SeaWorld and Balboa Park.",-1,0,0.375489418

When I returned home there were emails from the hotel saying &quot;looking forward to you staying with us&quot;.

260983636,Do not stay here!  I am here for 2 nights and both nights they had the worst group of musicians playing a concert until 12:30am.  They are about  50 feet from my door!   Who in their right mind lets a group put on a concert at a hotel?  They obviously made a lot of money from this group because they don't care who has to up all night listening to it.  Every time I called the front desk it just rang... no one would answer.  I had to call from my cell phone just to get someone to answer.  Then they informed me there was nothing they could do for me!  Yesterday I tried to go to one of their restaurants for lunch and only half of the tables were full but it was an hour wait for food!  They have the nerve to call this a Resort and Convention Center!  I will never come here again for a conference!,-1,8,0.550340136

I called several times asking for a copy of my bill - no response.----------------I just wanted to tell you how disappointed I was with our stay.We arrived Thursday night.  We were given a room on the 9th floor.  The elevator was so rickety, I asked for a lower floor room.  The front desk gal was clearly annoyed even though I had just come from a very empty lobby.  She put me on hold so long I hung up and called back.  At which point she said that a bellman was already on the way with new keys.  She couldn't have gotten back on the phone and explained that to me?We were then put in Room 1129, the carpet was so damp that it smelled like mildew, but at this point it was after midnight.The line to get a table for the buffet took literally 20 minutes Friday morning.  Then they said we couldn't sit outside.  Instead we sat inside with little birds flying around.We came back friday night late and discovered the phone didn't work, so we went to the front desk to tell them we were checking out Saturday morning.  We also inquired about room service.  The front desk did not have a menu, but gave me a number to call from the lobby phone.  It was Charley's bar, who just said to come over as they were too busy to deliver.  We were then referred to Starbucks and the bar kiosk by the pool.Even the vending machine near our room didn't work!Your website is as outdated as your facility.",-1,2,0.343404635

To make matters worse, while I requested a room in the Palm Towers, I was placed in one of the &quot; ranch rooms&quot; and I did not feel safe. As a single woman, I generally avoid outside entry rooms on lower levels at all costs. I was placed on the second floor of an outside entry room that was closento the highway. I voiced my concern and I was told this was my only option. Also, the tv had terrible reception and the walls were thin.

It was a last minute booking (due to a maintenance issue at my residence), so I suppose I was lucky to get a room on a busy weekend in San Diego. I hadn't stayed here previously, and found it to be a charming property from the outside. However, it was a bit overpriced for the quality of the dated room and more like staying at a budget motel than a &quot;resort.&quot; I stayed here during an unusual summer rain storm and was drenched getting to my room as the roof overhangs on the outdoor building to my room didn't have gutters. The lack of adequate drainage on the ground was also unequipped to handle the rain, so I had to trek through flooded outdoor walkways to access the room. The parking was an issue, and I couldn't find a space near the building of my room both nights I stayed. The parking and resort &quot;service&quot; fees are excessive for what you get in return. The ice machine was a long walk to another building, and guest services was understaffed and of no help. I found this surprising for the size and occupancy of the property. My advice is to keep your expectations low if you choose to stay here. Be sure to do your research, and read reviews here (and on Yelp) first.",-1,0,0.531449106

During the conference my laptop and portable hard drive were stolen from one of the workshop rooms that was supposed to be locked over the lunch hour.

Security was virtually invisible during our stay.  San Diego police stated that security had been very poor and they were aware of several other times that articles had been stolen in the past.  They also stated that the resort had done very little to improve their security.  Their insurance company stated this week that they were not liable for reimbursing my loss because no one could absolutely identify the thief as a staff person, although staff were the only people having access to the room.There were several individuals who did not appear to be staying at the resort who would yell at us and at trees or flowers during the day.

230972533,"Booked a room here a few months ago since I would be attending a conference and like to stay on-site whenever possible.  I read all the mixed (mostly bad) reviews and still decided to take my chances since the reservation I made was for a &quot;Premium&quot; room [$139/night] and I was told it would be in one of the renovated towers.  Fast forward to today when I arrived...As others have said, it's tough to find something/anything positive to write about the property or rooms.  I was given a &quot;Garden&quot; room that was dirty, old, and smelled, so I asked the front desk (and later spoke with a manager) about why my reservation for a tower room wasn't being honored.  They said reservations booked at a conference rate are always Garden rooms, but I could upgrade to one of the &quot;recently renovated&quot; tower rooms for $40/night.  I knew I wasn't staying in that first room, so I made the mistake of thinking the tower room would actually be acceptable, because there was no way this manager would send me to another bad room now that he's charging me $179/night.  While the tower room was certainly better, it was also dirty, not fully serviced, and had stains on the carpet, furniture, and bedspreads.At this point, I just decided to cut my losses and move to another nearby hotel.  There are many in close proximity...it's not called &quot;Hotel Circle&quot; for nothing.  After some negotiation, they wanted to charge me a full night (not sure if it would have been $139 or $179) since it was after 6pm, I ended up paying a $50 cancellation fee plus $6+ taxes and $5 parking for the 25-30 minutes I was occupying a spot, I guess.  As I now sit in my clean room, which is also $139/night, less than a third of a mile away, I can't help but think that was probably the best $61 that I've spent in a long time.Read the reviews, learn from my mistake, and just book at a nearby hotel and walk here for your convention.",-1,0,0.454208754

She immediately said that the breakfast was ordered through room service and she had &quot;nothing to do with it&quot;.  They were charging us for the room service and for the buffet.

We had to describe the clerk in detail and another clerk at the desk finally said who they thought gave us bad info.  The clerk helping us was now thoroughly irritating me and I asked to speak to the manager or a supervisor.  She informed me that she was the manager, but didn't even have a name tag on.  She tried to explain her position, but lacked the necessary language skills to properly convey her ideas to us.  We argued some more and she started taking off charges, had to get information from the other clerk at the desk that I would think she should have known, and then informed us that we were responsible for paying the tax and delivery charge on the room service meal.  We argued more and she would not relent.  FINALLY, i just paid the bill, but it turns out they MISCHARGED us anyway and we need to argue some more with them.

120355358,"I worked in the service industry for years, so I was particularly appalled by the astonishing lack of service at the Town and Country Resort Hotel in San Diego. I was rooming with a business associate who&#39;d reserved the hotel room for the World Fantasy Convention the last week of October.  Despite the fact that I was named on the reservation, the hotel front desk not only wouldn&#39;t let me check in until my associate got into town over five hours later, but was completely unconcerned when I told them I was about to have back surgery and needed to lie down after a seven hour flight.  After my associate arrived, the damage was already done and I spent five days in absolute misery.  The hotel pool did not have clear hours posted--in fact the only posted hours were next to one of the three entrances to the pool area and in complete shadow.  So the first night when we went in to the pool to swim unknowingly after the pool was closed, we were alarmed to be confronted by armed security guards with their guns out.

The low point of...</span><span class=""fullText hidden"" data-hiddenOnPageLoad=""true"">I worked in the service industry for years, so I was particularly appalled by the astonishing lack of service at the Town and Country Resort Hotel in San Diego. I was rooming with a business associate who'd reserved the hotel room for the World Fantasy Convention the last week of October.  Despite the fact that I was named on the reservation, the hotel front desk not only wouldn't let me check in until my associate got into town over five hours later, but was completely unconcerned when I told them I was about to have back surgery and needed to lie down after a seven hour flight.  After my associate arrived, the damage was already done and I spent five days in absolute misery.  The hotel pool did not have clear hours posted--in fact the only posted hours were next to one of the three entrances to the pool area and in complete shadow.  So the first night when we went in to the pool to swim unknowingly after the pool was closed, we were alarmed to be confronted by armed security guards with their guns out. Then, despite trying every restaurant on the resort property, we received horrendous service in every one.  In the bar designated as the convention bar, only one bartender was on duty. Not only was he slow, but he was also rude and incapable of keeping the bar or tables bussed.  The low point of my experience came upon discovering that a gift basket had been sent to the resort for me on Thursday, October 27, and that the hotel not only didn't bring me the package, but didn't even bother to tell me it had arrived.  I found out on my own (October 30) when the sender asked if I hadn't received it.  A busboy drove me to the package room in a golf cart--much appreciated--and once I finally got to where the gift basket was, I was charged a five dollar handling fee.  Yep--charged FIVE DOLLARS for NOT receiving a package.  I found this experience to be the signature attitude of the hotel and its staff (excepting one bellman, one server, the maid service in our room and one front of the house manager) throughout the whole of my stay. No one seemed to care that the entire hotel was providing NO service at all.  This hotel was an unmitigated disaster, and the entire business convention ruined as a result of their lack of care for their guests.</span><span class=""taLnk ulBlueLinks moreBtn"" onclick=""widgetEvCall('handlers.clickExpand', event, this);"">More</span>",-1,0,0.523555556
156476377,We booked a total of 8 rooms for a family wedding we were attending. (Stayed here about 3 years ago and had a pleasant stay.) Here are some of my complaints. Rooms were old and outdated. Lighting was dark. Sheets had partial tearing in them. Requested 2 of the rooms to be next to each other or adjoining for myself and my elderly mother ( I realized could not guarantee). After checking in they said there was nothing available. I found 2 others in our wedding party that had checked in after us that had connecting rooms and they were willing to change with me. I contacted the front desk to change. They were very rude and finally agreed to let us switch rooms. I even helped the maid change the sheets. Breakfast was terrible. We had the buffet at the Terrace CafÃ©.  Food was cold and french toast so hard you could not even cut with a knife. Worst  of all...after returning one evening my daughter  found a COCKROACH on the bathroom floor in her room.  She immediately contacted the front desk and asked to be moved (this was at midnight). Front desk was rude and acted like she was bothering them! None of the guests in our wedding party will ever stay here again (nor will any of our family or friends).,-1,1,0.594259259

I called the front desk but never got a replacement. The pool at the tower I was at was closed, the maintenance workers I saw around the grounds were just standing around talking. The gym was a mess, no clean towels available, no water available either. Ceiling tiles were missing in the gym ceiling, the tv's in the gym didn't work either. Somebody had spilled some kind of liquid in the elevator and nobody cleaned it up. The elevator also smelled terrible. The grounds are beautiful but the hotel itself is run down and in terrible condition. When I checked out the woman checking out never even looked at, she did ask me anything about my room or stay.

However, after telling the person at the registration desk that I now needed a first floor room, he said  &quot;why didn't you request that when you make your reservation&quot;. I informed him that there had been a change in health since the reservation was made and he told me I could come back to check in when the room was ready. Since I had already waited over 20 min. in a line that went from the desk around to a door at the side entrance, I was not happy. We waited for over an hour without receiving a call from registration as promised and went back to registration and were told that the room was still being cleaned, that the carpet had to be cleaned. To make a long story short, we finally got into our &quot;cleaned&quot; room at 6pm. The refrigerator requested during registration was not in the room, so we had to call for a refrigerator. When we returned to our room around 9pm, our keys did not work. I walked back to registration and when I asked for someone to take me back to the room, I was told they only had 1 person on duty. This was a Friday night and I was attending a large convention, I can't believe a &quot;:resort&quot; that hosts conventions had so few staff on duty.. We were cold once we finally got into our room and when we looked behind the drapes that were sagging in the middle the louvers on part of our window were stuck open &amp; the crank to close the window was broken. When we tried to turn the heat on there was no response from the thermostat, so we had trouble sleeping because we were cold.Wouldn't you know it, the maid opened the door early in the morning! Unfortunately, we realized there  wasn't a &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign available.until after being awakened. We left the room a few hours later &amp; when we returned to the room 4 hours later, the room hadn't been cleaned! We called housekeeping and someone came quickly, but the carpet remained dirty &amp; my friend told me she had found 2 dirty wash cloths on the shower rod in the morning.

I tried to change rooms immediately, but they were completely booked and told me to try the next day.  They did manage to get me into another room the next day, but it was only a slight improvement.  Thankfully it didn't smell, but the bathroom was not cleaned!  There were hairs all over the tub and on the shower curtain.  This was my worst experience at a hotel my entire life.  If you need to be in hotel circle, stay at a different hotel.  We had a special rate of $152 for this hotel and it is definitely not worth it!

We bought a package that the front desk was inclusive of internet, fitness AND SPA and parking.  Turns out the Spa was closed two out of the four days we paid for and the package didn't include the spa (at least according to the spa).  Also when my husband and I went to the fitness center together, they told us that the package was for one person only.

There are actually no windows on 3 sides of that building.  We had a convention there, and everything was so difficult to find it was unbelievable.  This is not really a resort by any modern standards-- there is no green space, just a mass of confusing blacktop roads leading to the practically unmarked buildings.  There was a few small pools, and overgrown plants and shrubs everywhere.  Every room I saw looked like poor colonial-style decor from the late 70's/early 80's, with loud floral prints, tons of ugly wallpaper, and loud teal carpet.  The food was not real appealing either.   Parking was expensive.  (So was everything else, and it all cost extra) The only good thing was the trolley stopped just a block away.

The climate controls in the rooms are apparently there solely for the purpose of keeping the occupant distracted.  No matter what thermostat setting you choose, you get a humid 75 degrees of something blowing out the vent.The grounds are huge and there are a number of swimming pools and restaurants on the property.  The overall effect of the outdoor setting is actually charming.  Unfortunately, there are no consumer alternatives within walking distance:  i.e. no convenience markets or family restaurants to visit.  Without a car, you are stuck entirely at the mercy of the establishment.  It's like being trapped in Disneyland without the rides.  Every beverage costs you an hour's pay.  The restaurant portions were both skimpy and expensive.  A club sandwhich, which consisted of four corners that appeared to have been snatched off of an hors d'oeuvres tray, was about $11 at one of the &quot;casual&quot; restaurants.In the way of toiletries, your room comes only with soap, body lotion and shampoo.  In order to expedite my way through airport security, I decided to buy toothpaste, mouthwash and deodorant at my destination.  That was a mistake.  When I stayed at the Hampton Inn in Stockton, the room included a basket containing mouthwash, deodorant, shaving cream, shampoo, a razor and a comb.  The Town and Country had just such a package for sale in their gift shop -- for twelve bucks!Many places have free high-speed internet access.  Not so at this place.  Their WiFi costs you $2.95 and hour or $9.95 per day.

Royal blue carpets, not clean under beds (I always check that) and skimpy on amenities (coffee was hideous).The Ugly: thought most things were dated and for the price we could have stayed at the Mariott and had a modern room.

The room I stayed in had a shutter-style window, so the window doesn't actually close.  This gave me the opportunity to hear everyone as they walked by my room and the freeway.  What a horrible design idea.  The room has three &quot;porno&quot; style mirrors on the wall in front of the bed.  Apparently, I was not the only one who thought that, which was evident by what I can only imagine were bodily fluids on the mirror.  Whoever picked out the artwork for the room needs to find a new line of work.  There was a picture of this creepy looking vintage-style girl on one wall.  If you ever stayed there you know what I'm talking about.  If you ever stay there you will know what I mean.  Bring something to cover the picture.  On another wall was a latin-inspired print and colonial style flowers on another.  I have no idea how they thought that matched.  The bathroom had close to no room to put anything on the sliver of a counter they offered.  Of course you wouldn't want a big counter since it would make the child-sized toilet look even smaller.  The ironing board had years worth of crud on it that I feared would get on my clothing so I opted not to use it.  I wont even bore you with my comments on the bedding, but enjoy.  It's 2001, upgrade your 19 inch, broken, tube television.I ate one of their sandwiches they had for sale in the deli.  If you get one of those, be sure to order two drinks so you can use one to soften the bread.  I went to Charlies which is their pub style restaurant.  Their food was actually okay.  Their employees were appalling.  I was the only customer when a group of ten people showed up and decided to eat outside.  The entire staff made inapropriate comments about those customers.  I know everyone jokes, which is fine, just don't do it in front of other customers.  The resort will continue to fill their rooms since employers will continue to send employees there for conferences, which was why I was there.  If your employer hasn't paid for your room and you don't require the convenience of being on the grounds for a conference, stay at the Double Tree.

I don't know if they responded or not, but when I got back to the room late on the second night, it was still intermittently shrieking.  (Didn't the housekeeping person hear it?) I called and requested immediate assistance.  It was 11:00 p.m.  To their credit, someone came in 15 minutes, and changed the battery, saying it had been inserted backward.  He was very nice.  However, he left and 5 minutes later the alarm went off again!  I climbed up on a chair and disconnected it from the wall, and in the morning demanded a NEW alarm be installed.  They did that, and it resolved the problem.  I had also reported that the sink in the bathroom backed up; however, nothing was done.  Physically, the resort is old and tired.  Handrails and chairs are sticky and icky.  Dirt is in every corner.  The rooms are very dated.  They are starting to renovate.  That's fine, but be advised they start banging at 7:00 a.m.!  Then on Sunday there was a fire in the construction dumpster outside the Royal Palm Tower, releasing toxic fumes.  Final indignity: I told the desk when I checked in that I would have a rental car the first four nights and then return it.  They said they understood and would charge me the parking fee for 4 nights.  Then when I returned the car I duly surrendered the parking pass and and went back to the front desk to confirm I would be charged parking for 4 nights.

The selection committee had been told that the entire facility would be renovated which was a complete and unethical sales tactic regardless of who owned what when.The reviews stating that this property &quot;isn't so bad&quot; obviously were not placed in old rooms (they are all old so renovated is relative) with dank air, moldy air conditioners and dirty carpet.  Ironically, I am now on antibiotics just prescribed by my ENT doctor for first time in life following return home.  Just saying.I moved to the Royal Palm (they consider this building updated) after a bad night with bad Oder in first room.  Mixed blessing as my new room adjoined a couple that had children that woke crying, whining and shreaking every morning at 4 am.  The crying and whining was continuous til they left after 7 am.  I and other rooms from my group called front desk about these kids.  I was stuck for at least 5 nights with this family.  They should have been moved to a far building...there were plenty of &quot;far buildings&quot;.Food was dismal and we walked to mall for decent choices.  Exception to this was the late pizza ordered from a friendly staff at the coffee bar.  Like others have said, the hotel was planning on closing the larger restaurant prior to my group (hundreds) arrival.  They kept it open for a few more days but really, who wants to eat at a restaurant they are shutting down?  Dishes were dirty.  Waiter blamed the hard water.  I blame old dishes.  Lipstick on my tea glass at lunch.  It happens but too many things were &quot;happening&quot;.Toilet did not flush unless you stayed in bathroom and repeatedly coaxed handle to right position.  Sliders didn't lock on balcony door.  (very thin runners that I doubt pass earthquake codes).  Pool to noisy to sit out on balcony and I had to call desk to clear a laughing-hyena-lady out at 11:30.  The staff (what remains?) seems to be very professional in dealing with adverse conditions.  My opinion is they all need to seek employment elsewhere and neighboring hotels should review their resumes with great interest as they have worked the toughest property in San Diego.  Christian at front desk was aware of my concerns from past visit and I applaud his calming manner in easing my mind that I was on a &quot;move&quot; list next morning.  There was little he could do about the propert and I completely fault my organization for returning to this property.  Buyer beware.The staff is not to blame.  I only saw professional work ethic, friendly with a touch of apology on bad situation.  They are working hard and deserve better owners.

The rooms are old and somewhat claustrophobic.    The restrooms in the rooms are tiny as well as the bathroom fixtures.  Carpeting is antiquated and the odor both inside the room and in the hotel building itself does not reflect a clean and tidy atmosphere.

The line was moving very slow due to only half of the front counter were open/manned and some of the guests were frustrated and cranky. After the mayhem outside the hotel fighting over a parking spot who could blame them. After about 20 minutes of waiting it was my turn. When I heard &quot;Next in line&quot; I stepped up to the counter.  The customer service person behind the desk must be having a bad day by the way she moved about the behind the counter and from the way she handled my paperwork.  When I mentioned to her about the parking situation/experience, she seemed unsympathetic.  3) After first night of stay, a maid left a (One liter bottle of water) in our room that says $2.50 if the seal is broken. This is not a complimentary bottle of water mind you. Anyway, I wasn't dying of thirst so we left that bottle of water alone.  Later on that evening we ordered an In-room dining service; two small plate of something called California fruit palette and (Although there were no bottle water listed on their menu) 4 bottles of water.  After the food delivery guy who banged on our front door continuously until we opened the door, as if we didn't hear after the first bang, we received our tray of food. The total bill came to whopping $70.00 dollars!! When I read the itemized receipt, to my surprise $5.00 per 20 oz bottle water X 4 = $20.00! I should've just opened the one liter bottle of water that was sitting on the desk for just $2.50.  I don't get it.  When I asked the person working at the front desk how do you justify charging $5.00 for 20 0z bottle of water from the kitchen and then you leave one liter bottle in the room for $2.50? He had a very puzzled look on his face but gave me no answer. 4)  If you like bugs there were plenty of that in our room. Our room guest consist of: one &quot;Earwig&quot; bug in our sink to greet us and two pretty good size spiders crawling around our ceiling doing tricks. Bugs don't bother us, however, something to watch for in your room if you have family members who are afraid of the bugs.   5) I've traveled all over the United States and stayed in many of the major hotel chains, and Town and Country hotel is our first that we have stayed that charges parking fee.  When our son attends San Diego State University next year to play football we will be visiting San Diego often, however, Town and Country will NOT be on our list of hotel we would want to stay.

It is a 38 acre property, which sounds nice, except it is 38 acres of concrete and asphalt between a freeway, shopping mall and a train depot. The room quality was poor.  The hotel has various room options from single level bungalows, to very old concrete condo style with outdoor catwalks. The buildings are unpainted concrete, poorly lit at night.  The room itself had parque fake-wood and a moldy bathroom door frame. The bed was way too soft, and sagged in the middle. Towels were super- worn, and the shower head was only mounted at about 5 feet, so you had to &quot;duck&quot; under it. The bathroom amenities were poor and scant, with some heavily perfumed soap. The iron leaked and did not get hot enough to iron a cotten suit dress shirt.  It would seem the last update to the property was in the 1970s. Hallway (outdoor) noise was noticeable when trying to sleep, with a car alarm going off. Building was surrounded by asphalt.  TV in room was old school (not flat screen) and every channel had snow so it was hard to watch.

Misleading:  Here is an excerpt from their website: &quot;..the new Town and Country is a modern expression of the 1960âs Southern California vibe...&quot;  When I made my reservation, the representative talked about how the place had been renovated; which is why I decided to try the hotel again.  Well when I got there, they gave me an old moldy, humid and hot room.  I called them and informed them that I cannot stay in such a room.  They switched me to another room, that was slight better, as at least it wasn't hot and moldy.  When I mentioned that I thought all the rooms had been renovated, the receptionist stated that only certain parts of the towers had been renovated.  The website nor does their booking agent disclose this information, so you don't find this out until you are already there. I was so disappointed.  Then they tell me that they cannot upgrade me to a renovated room because the reserved slot of conference rooms was booked at a certain rate.  The photos shown on their website are misleading and do NOT adequately represent this hotel, as only a small set of the rooms look like the hotel website photos.  Pros:1. Friendly staff 2. Renovated rooms are great - do NOT get an unrenovated one! 3. Pretty grounds 4. Great fitness center -- bikes, treadmills, ellipticals, free weights, circuit training weights, medicine balls, pull up bars, etcCons:1. Unclean - moldy, mildewed, ancient carpet2. Unstylish - ugly fabric, wallpaper, accents3. Not really close to anything.  There is an upscale mall behind the hotel but other than that there's nothing there.  4. Not a hotel but really a MOTEL...the doors on more than 90% of the rooms are all on the exterior of the building!!!  There was only one small building with interior room entrances.  5. Overpriced - they need to demolish half of the property.  The exterior of the buildings reveal chipped paint, rotten wood, rust stains, discolored metal, etc.  I DO NOT recommend this place to anyone unless you get a renovated room.  One of my friends had a renovated room and it was amazing...it actually looked like the photos shown on their website.  MAKE SURE YOU SPECIFICALLY ASK FOR A RENOVATED ROOM AND GET IT IN WRITING WHEN YOU BOOK!  My advice to the management team: Be honest with your customers (don't falsely advertise) and indicate that you are in the process of renovations....all the rooms have not been completely renovated!!! Let's be honest, less than 50% of the rooms have been renovated!!!  Also, the name Town &amp; Country does not have to reflect an outdated country appearance, you can preserve that country style with a modern flair and clean amenities.Check out my photos!",-1,25,0.525697913

The pool areas are nice as well. However, I do not know if the rooms have been updated since 1985. The hotel has outdated wallpaper, faded bedding, and worn out furniture. I also did not find it to be secure. It seems anyone could wander in and out. While we were there we encountered issues with the air conditioner, shower (not draining) and toilet (leaking).

236264699,"This big hotel is right in the middle of Hotel CIrcle, and right off the freeway exit, so the location is great and very convenient to Mission Valley, Qualcomm Stadium, SDSU, USD, and only 8-12 minutes to downtown, Old Town, and Gaslamp areas of SD.  They cater to large conventions often, but also are an option for pleasure stay, as well as groups. Unlike their name, they are not what we would call a &quot;Resort&quot; in any way, however.   The Mission Valley Mall is directly behind the hotel, so there are several great restaurants (and super shopping) just 1 block away . We ate at the Mall's Cheesecake Factory, and Stacked, literally just 3 minutes from the hotel.   The entire hotel is old-fashioned and outdated, including the lobby, the rooms and the resaurants, and the decor is not what you would expect for a &quot;resort&quot; in San Diego.  There are several &quot;towers&quot; (buildings) to choose accomodations in, and we took a room in the &quot;best/most updated building&quot;; The Royal Palm Tower.  There is nothing &quot;royal or palm-ish&quot; about it however, with the decor being musty and semi-victorian. The dark woods, and blue and gold velvet chairs, combined with the 1/4 fabric tapestry castle-style curtains above our beds, and lace window sheers were reminiscent of the pirate's bedroom inside the Pirates of the Caribbean ride and Great-Great Grandma's house deep in the mid-west.   There are  2 Queens or 1 King bed offered in this tower, and the beds are basic, non-pillowtop style, with basic pillows which are polyester and firm. One of  our queen beds sagged severly and we both dipped into the middle like two bowling balls on a sponge. Additionally the mattress made loud, squeaky sounds with every move, and it sounded like we were trying to pop a large balloon all night long. At first it was comical, but truly we did not get any deep sleep that night due to the discomfort and noise of the bed.   The rooms are a good size in this tower, with a full bathroom with 1 sink, and a dressing area with another sink too. The room windows face the pool courtyard, and have sliding glass doors and a personal balcony with a table and chairs, which we like. The front doors all face the main parking lot though, (with no interior halls or corridors, it's all covered, but outdoors), and the parking lot gets very full and noisy after dinner when most guests return.  When booking, there is an additonal &quot;resort&quot; fee and a parking fee too, but many rates you can book at the hotel discount or include them, so check the hotel's packages or on-line for your best savings.    If the beds had been far better and we didn't care about the musty, depressing decor or over-crowded parking lot, for the money we could consider staying again. Although far better than a motel, often you get only what you pay for, and this was one of those times.",-1,0,0.474135611

BUT, just stayed here as a guest and the room was pitiful- small, old, musty, tiniest bathroom ever, nasty bedspread, the worst roll-away ever, clunky loud A/C unit.  First, room was supposed to be &quot;premium&quot; room with 2 doubles with patio by the pool, so kids could go in and out as I requested at booking.  They messed that up and we had a second floor room with one king that did overlook the pool but required running up and down steps all day.  Wasps kept hanging around the patio (we had the maintenance guy spray).  The worst part, though, was the service.  We put 3 balloons at the poolside table for my daughter's birthday, which prompted a lecture from a very stern manager about no outside food at the pool, which we were not planning (we did open a tab and the bar and purchased overpriced drinks from them along with the overpriced hotel room).  The older, more rustic accommodations were forgivable had the service been decent.  But, It was rare to encounter anyone, from the bartender, servers or security staff who smiled or went out of their way to make you feel welcome.  We had to ask for towels, search for a server, etc.   And, the kicker is that they are by no means a bargain.. I regularly stay at the Hyatt for less than we paid to stay here and this place has nothing to justify the prices that they charge for a room.Perhaps allowing locals to use the facilities (which, being a local, is great for me) has shifted their focus away from taking care of their hotel guests, but I would not recommend this place to visiting friends and family.  I do have to say that the young woman who checked us out (which we had to WAIT IN LINE to do???  Hello?  21 st century- see electronic check out please) was very nice and even comped our parking.  She was the only person we encountered who seemed to get the whole concept of customer service.",-1,4,0.502531229

Whilst the location is good for accessing Sea World and the Zoo (with a free shuttle provided), there is nothing much else around with the nearest decent restaurants in Old Town. In hindsight, we should have paid a few dollars more and stayed downtown. Despite being referred to as a resort, this property is essentially a motel and has that sought of feel about it.

4390993,"I stayed at the Handelry with a group on buisness. The group as a whole likes to stay at budget hotels so this review isn't based on expecting a four or five star resort. First point, calling the Handlery a resort is marketing at best. The hotel is a 1950's style motor court that looks like it was last updated in the mid 1970's. I made my reservation on the internet. When I checked in they couldn't find my reservation. They kind of winced when I told themI booked on the internet so they must have recuring problems with that system. I had a printed reservation confirmation so I gave that to clerk to assist. It didn't help. The young lady at the front desk told me that I made a mistake in booking the wrong date, was charged a no show and that was the reason why they couldn't find my reservation. But she said at that point everything was fine. I asked for the confirmation back the check for myself and as I suspected, I had booked the correct dates. I later checked with my credit card company to see if they had charged me with a no show and they had not so the front desk clerk had totally lied to my face to cover their mistake. So they put me in first floor room that had two double beds, which would have been fine except that I had reserved a king. So back over to the front desk I went. The clerk (different one this time) moved me to a different room with a king. We wake the next morning to find that the pipes had backed up into the sink in the bathroom and left a deposit of rust and god knows what else. If we were not with a group we would have sought another hotel close by but we didn't have much of a choice without a major pain going from one hotel to stay and another for meetings. Other than the first front desk clerk who lied to me the other staff were friendly and tried to help but obviously have very little to work with.Do yourself a favor and avoid the Handlery.",-1,0,0.357738095

This hotel's rates were higher than other options without the quality to back it upParking costs extra, ballpark of $12 per day.  There is an exorbitant charge held for &quot;incidentals&quot; ($100 per night which came to $300 total for me, compared to $50 total or $0 total from other hotels). When I refused to allow the $300 charge I was left feeling very un-welcome but they still gave me a room for fear of losing my business. No elevators. The room had a filthy dirty carpet which literally turned brand-new white socks black within the first three minutes walking in the room after check-in, and filth continued to also be a problem each day after a maid enters to &quot;clean&quot;; and made bare feet visibly revoltingly dirty. Hole in tile on wall in shower. Very dated and poor quality shower and bath fixtures. No option for 2 queen beds (only 1 for 2 double beds).  We got a king mattress but where would the kids sleep?

157521717,"We stayed at the Handlery Hotel with our two young kids over spring break.  They tout it as a 4 star hotel but I'd say it's a stretch to give it 3 stars in any hotel ranking.  We arrived and checked in at the lobby which looks like, at one point, they had great plans for this place.  We got our key, paid the parking fee and headed out to our room.  That's when our thoughts went from &quot;this may be really nice&quot; to &quot;what the heck is this place?&quot; Once you leave the lobby, you're on your own! You enter the building to the rooms through a beat up push door ala 7-Eleven.  Once inside, the carpet looks to be about 20 years old and there is a hair salon at one end of the building that looks like it's straight out of an old Sears.  When we entered our non-smoking room, the smell of decades old smoke hit us like a brick wall.  Even our children asked us why the room stunk.  We entered and low-and-behold, we were basically in a Motel 6. In fact, I've been in Motel 6s nicer than this room.  Old carpet, rusty tub fixtures, a clogged drain, and a sticky old sliding door to the patio that was probably original to this 50+ year old building. My husband was awakened at 4am by housekeeping staff shouting and going in and out of a janatorial closet near our room. We were mortified to hear the guests in the room next to us doing &quot;things&quot; you really don't want your young children to hear! If that's the kind of place this is, the owners should at least embrace it!  Don't stick a cheap granite-top nightstand and desk into each room and call it a 4 star hotel.  Don't be fooled by the name.  This is MOTEL quality through and through.  My advise is to stay at the Double-Tree or Marriot across the way or if you just need a nice clean place to rest, stay at the Motel 6 a few doors down and save yourself a ton of money.  This may be the first time that I actually felt ripped-off by staying in a &quot;hotel&quot;.  I only gave this place a 2 because it is pretty centrally located and you can get to quite a few restaurants, shopping centers, theme parks and freeways pretty easily.

655006928,"My family, total of 15, but broken down to four of us(my wife, my 2 sons and myself), my sister and my parents and then relatives, were taking a tour that left out of and returned to San Diego and uses the Handlery as the meeting place.  So the night before we were to leave, the four of us moved from a great night at the Westin Gaslamp, to meet the others for a night at the Handlery.  We had a room facing the interstate.  The noise level felt like the sliding glass door was open.  My cousins that also stayed there said the walls were thin and heard televisions and people all night. The one bright spot was the restaurant staff the next morning opened early for us and accommodated our needs.When we returned, I was only going to stay at the Handlery because my parents were staying there.  They decided when we arrived after the tour that they were not staying and going to relatives.  I wanted to switch hotels but the cancellation policy is 24 hours.  They would not cancel my parentâs room. We voiced our concerns about the previous bad night of noise so they put us in a room away from the highway, 212.   So I kept the extra room, that my parents would have been in, that they would not cancel, and my wife and I stayed in one room, 212, my kids in another 208, and my sister in another.After a long day of travel and dinner my wife got into bed around 7:30 as I watched tv.  Then a rattling sound started coming from the wall where the tv is.  I thought it was our refrigerator and got out of bed to check.  I then noticed out fridge is in between the beds, this was coming from the other side of the wall.I called the front desk, a male answered, and I told him a rattling noise is coming from the 214 side of our room please check.  It was too loud to be able to sleep through.  After about 15 minutes and no change in sound, I called back.A female answered and I explained the situation again.  She put me on hold.  She came back and said security checked 214 and it was quite.  I again said it is not people or tv, it is a rattling sound, more like a bad refrigerator.  She said she would send security again.About another 15 minutes passed and I thought I heard security in the hall, so I got up and went into the hall to get them and show them, or let them listen, to the problem.  When I was in the hall I did not see security, but I did notice there was an unmarked door between mine, 212, and 214.I called the front desk again and the female said security found nothing in 214.  I said I noticed the unmarked door; please send security to my room.Security showed up in about 10 minutes and came into 212 and heard the noise right away.  One stayed in the room, the other said he would go out and see if he could find it.  In about a minute the noise stopped and he radioed the security that stayed in the room if the noise had stopped.  We confirmed.  He said the room next to us is a pump room and they would try to fix the problem.  He also mentioned 210, was open if I wanted to switch.After about 10 minutes the rattling returned, not quite as loud, but now there was also a loud squeak.  I tried to call the front desk to tell them to move us but no one answered.I got dressed and headed to the desk.  When I reached the desk, the female attending, said she just talked to my wife and knew we want to switch rooms.  She suggested some room upstairs, somewhere.  I said 210.  She hesitated and I repeated 210, also knowing that my 2 young children would be nearby.She returned with the keys and offered her apologies and had coupons for a free breakfast.  I told her to keep the coupons, as I would be leaving for the airport before the restaurant opened and just mentioned to get my wakeup call correct.There were no problems with 210.The obvious point to this long event is that on that first call when I said I hear a rattling sound coming from the wall on the side of 214, they should have said that is not possible, and that there is a pump room between you.  And if maintenance was not on staff at this hour, they should have immediately offered to provide another room.  And then the petty apology of a free, overpriced, breakfast is terrible customer service. We gave them 10 rooms tied into this trip, the least they could have done was taken one of them off the bill.Please, no need to reply, our paths will not cross again.",-1,1,0.473542098

398872221,"We stood at the Handlery for 2 nights while being in beautiful San Diego for our sons travel sports team tournaments.  We were very disappointed.  We got a discount on the room rate for booking with the group but still paid about $150.00/night.  This place was so not worth it.  The hotel is old with bandages all over basically.  The hotel smells bad through out the entire property.  It appears to be clean but the smell is telling you something totally different which gave us a creepy/ekkey feeling!  The staff is rude.  We had to interact with about 12 people during the course of our stay.  Out of those 12, 4 were nice and kind.  The bell boy who showed us other room choices after complaining about our room was great! The ladies who were doing housekeeping during our stay were also very kind and the best person we encountered here was the waitress who was covering the restaurant and pool in the evening, I believe her name was Mia (she was super sweet, funny, helpful and kind, she was a younger African-American girl).  Sara at the front desk tried to be nice but her hands were pretty much tied and couldn't really help us with any of our request.Sam (manager) listened to my complaints about us not liking the room, the room smelling very badly, the employees being very rude, them not having any water or refreshments or ANYTHING for the guest in the lobby.  He offered to switch us rooms but all 6 rooms we seen were identical to what we already had so switching served no purpose.  After telling him this, he offered to help us check out of the Handlery early... WOW!  Sad shame.  LIke I said, we just were not happy here at all.  The hotel is OLD, stinky and doesn't look nearly as nice as the website makes it look.  The pool was the nicest part of our stay.  Good size, fresh clean water and you can order drinks out there.  The gym is a joke.  They had 5 machines and one had an out of order sign on it.  They had an okay set of weights available too.Unless I had no other choice, I will not be staying at this hotel again until they fix the smell issue and upgrade the place.  Good luck everyone and happy travels!",-1,4,0.65575

I was eight months pregnant and carrying my sleeping two year old, while my husband pushed most of our luggage on the stroller. It was late afternoon, and the hotel was mostly empty. I can't imagine the lady who checked us in being less helpful. She checked us into a room on the second floor, with no elevator access...and she had absolutely no qualms about it. &quot;It's just one flight of stairs,&quot; she told us. Seriously? Our actual room wasn't much better. The sliding glass doors to the patio did little to block the sound and draft of the freeway, which was right outside. The bathroom was small, and the sink stank badly from some kind of blockage. I'd say the most disgusting part of the room was the mini fridge: It clearly hadn't been plugged in for quite a while, which I didn't realize until I opened its door to a warm putrid blast of air in my face. At least it was empty, I guess?Although the hotel did offer free in-and-out parking, the parking attendant seemed generally irritated that we were pulling him away from whatever Netflix show he was watching on his phone as we tried to figure out which slot to put our ticket into...I wouldn't stay here again.

We finally got to the room and called the front desk to make sure we were in an upgraded room.  They said yes and that only premier rooms were pool side.

Service was also very poor: loud neighbors were ignored by management (made worse with paper thin walls), had to wait for 20 minutes to get my key when checking in, and we got no help with the internet - which turned out to just be spotty, but if you are going to charge for it, how about some service?

We had a patio door to our room that lead out to a shared patio.  The door hardly shut and were afraid that someone could easily get into our room.  Upon looking around there were 2 half drank bottles of water sitting on the dresser top.  So it made us wonder if someone else had been in the room earlier?  Also our shower was TERRIBLE!  The water trickled out not only did it not have pressure. it was actually hard to get clean because it was so weak.  I have never seen a shower that bad.  The bed was comfortable but the pillows were awful!  Both my boyfriend and I were up in the night trying to make our pillow flatten.  They were like plastic blowup pillows.  Also you have to pay for parking and the gate was broken.  Again the room was decorated nice and the bed was comfortable.  And they turned off the party jams at 9:00.  Those were the pluses.  The staff seemed friendly and nice.  Also the room had amazing blackout curtains.  You couldn't even tell when it was daylight.

However, when I arrived to the hotel I was told that I will be getting a king bed room which was not acceptable to me. I traveled with a colleague and we needed two beds. The girl at the front desk was something else! At first she blamed it on me, stating that I booked a room with one bed. When I presented her mu booking confirmation which clearly stated two-double beds, she began blaming on Expedia. She lied that Expedia ply allows you to request a type of room and it all depends on the availability. When I showed her on Expedia app that it is not true, she ran  out of excuses and just said there was an error. All this hassle was happening after 9 pm when I was exhausted from traveling and I all wanted is to get my room. The girl was persistent that it was my mistake and there is nothing they can do.After about 20 mins of this spectacle (we had a small audience at that point) a &quot;miracle&quot; had occurred and a double-bed room suddenly became available!

155313641,"Booked into this hotel with my wife and five year old son for five nights last July. It's more of a motel than a hotel. It's quite a large hotel/ motel in that the rooms are spread out over a low rise complex. The location is Ok as a cheap base to the likes of the zoo, Seaworld, and the chargers stadium. It's also quite close to a mall where you'll find good shops, restaurants and a cinema. However, a car is essential to visit all these locations. The hotel is actually located on a very busy motorway/freeway and is surrounded by such roads. The reception area is dark and unwelcoming. The main restaurant is adjoining and has the same appearance. The staff reflected the atmosphere I.e chewing gum in your face whilst yawning and complaining about the early hour they had to start work that morning (a conversation that occurred at 9.30am!).Now for the worst part. We were in a room on the second floor in the third block. The rooms have paper thin walls resulting you listening to you neighbours conversations at all hours of the night. You can't even use the air con as a white noise abstraction as it was the noisiest unit I have ever experienced. I have been fortunate enough to have stayed in some of the best hotels in the world. We booked this expecting basic facilities and a central base. This didn't even meet those standards. My lasting memory will be the awful smell and the mid matched carpets on the landings and stair wells that were taped together!!San Diego is a beautiful city.

The front desk had me fill out and fax a fairly lengthy form to facilitate this, which was an inconvenience (noting the gentleman in the guest services area that I faxed the form to was friendly and helpful).-My friend did precede me but after all the preparation work, the desk still had him put down a separate credit card!-Upon my arrival, I witnessed a guest nearly screaming at one of the hotel front desk people over service; the woman who checked me in was slow but did relate that she did not typically work the front desk and was filling in.-The room itself had multiple problems:  the room was dark and not well appointed, the key did not work well in the door, there were two bugs in the room, there was no soap in the bathroom (the maids did bring some after I called and were very helpful and apologetic).  At night, there was a pounding noise that went on for hours.  We were on the top floor; it may have been wind (there was a storm that night) but either there was someone making the noise, or something was not secured properly on the roof.-The food was good (and we did both dinner and a breakfast), so that is a plus.-All in all, I would have to say that the Handlery has severe management challenges.

So we walked all the way back to reception to be given an upstairs room.The front section of the rooms are nice and surround the pool, however once you go past these, they are prison type looking places, green wooden rooms, inside is much nicer, however outside is extremely dated more like the Bates Hotel in Physco.After we unpacked we noticed that the bed smelt of dog, we rang reception and they sent out staff to change the bedding.We then went out to discover San Diego, and returned tired and went to order room service, we noticed that the menu was very limited, i.e. sandwiches mainly, we ordered rec\luctuntly x 2 sandwhiches as we were tired and hungry,Next morning we walk up to have breakfast only to discover (after paying) that the staff were trying to cook on what looked like bunson burners, apparently the kitchen was under renovation, they neglicted to inform us of this.Had a nice day at Sea World and then returned to room to discover toilet was over flowing, rang reception yet again and they said that they would send someone, we waited an hour and rang again and someone was there within a few minutes, the repair man attended with towels to clean up the mess!  All we could think of was thank goodness we were leaving the next day or we might have received those towels for showering!Where the Flight Centre really pushed the Handlery, I can only imagine that they were getting kick backs because the only place that we discovered heaps of Australians staying at the same place, and yes upon speaking with them, were not happy with the Handlery either, and yes had booked thru Flight Centre.Would not recommend this hotel or Flight Centre",-1,2,0.468646384

We drove from Tucson to San Diego the day before we were to sail on a special package deal to take us to and from the ship.  When we checked in they did not offer breakfast like others had done before when we did this, till I asked about it, then got a  voucher.  We were told to park at the building where our room was located.  Nothing was given to us to indicate our car would be there for the entire week.  When we were picked up the next day and taken to the ship, my husband asked how to contact them when we got in, we were told, oh we don't pick you up, it is too congested.  So when we got on board, we called and they said if they had the shuttle available that maybe they could pick us up, but we would have to make arangments in advance.  We said we wouldn't be able to contact them till we docked, which we did, and they asked when we would be off, told them 9 am got off at 8:45, and no one there. Called and they said he left because we weren't there.  Anyway finally came at 10.  When we arrived at the hotel our car was not where we had parked it.  After searching all over, my husband found it two building over and back against a wall, and unlocked.  When we questioned the desk, they finally had an assistant security man tell us that they had to pave where our car was parked and had had it towed.  Evidently the left hand doesn't know what the right is doing in this place.  We  had no way of knowing if any damage had been down in towing it, and had a 500 mile trip to make across the desert.

The restaurant had thee worse dinner menu ever!! Who puts Mac &amp; Cheese, with options of sandwiches on their dinner menu and then offer salmon platter for lunch?? The food was horrible. I have to say the &quot;Best&quot; experience we had was our shuttle driver...Jeff and their taxi cab drivers, Ray &amp; Chengain!! PLS BEWARE of RICH.. another shuttle driver.. he is only out for himself. All the restaurants he recommends (ie. La Pinata in Old Town) was so horrible. I find out later that by him referring ppl  (he gives you a 10% off card with his name on it) he then eats there for free. ** Rich may seem friendly but he's only out for himself. The concierge service were great and friendly. The burgers in the lounge by the pool were fairly decent. I was EXTREMELY disappointed in the overall experience. For the price they charge and what you get..is &quot;WAY WAY&quot; OVER PRICED!! My mother had a better experience at the motel chain across the hwy with a cheaper rate and more options for shuttle services.  I would &quot;NEVER&quot; recommend this place to anyone.

At check out I mentioned all of my concerns and she said that she could give me a food voucher so that I could have breakfast there on them.

It may have been nice when it was built circa 1960 but the bad paint job and re-stucco fall short of any sort of renovation. The pool area is tacky and the gym has 20 year old Nautilus machines.  They probably ruined some nice mid century architecture with pink stucco and white columns.  The Best Western, Double Tree or the Holiday inn across the way are better values.  They also charge $9.00 a day for parking, many other hotels in area are free.  I'm glad I was only there 2 nights and only used the room to sleep.

As we carried our bags in, we passed the bellman, but he did not offer to help us.  Once in our room, we discovered it was a bit small, with two double beds.  The beds were typical hotel beds, nothing exceptional.  The room was light as one wall (the north) was a mostly glass with a sliding door.  There was a balcony overlooking the pool with two chairs and a small desk.  The room came with a small refrigerator that did not work very well.    My wife complained that the room was dusty.  There was no Internet access except for the $10.99 per day WebTV access or a public computer in the lobby.From the exterior appearance, the hotel looks as though it was built in the 1950s or 60s.  It is more of a motel than a hotel as most of the rooms are accessible from exterior, open hallways.  Parking cost $10 per night, though for some reason, we were not charged when we checked out.  The location is convenient.  It is a short drive to either the San Diego Zoo, Sea World or the Fashion Valley Mall, where there are several restaurants including the Cheesecake Factory.  The breakfast buffet was rather meager for $12.95; only one type of eggs (scrambled), French toast, sausage and bacon, fruit, yogurt, and cereal but no toast.

We tried the continental breakfast as it was included in the rate. Little choice of croissants, yoghurt and cereal. You can ask for toast. No ham or cheese. Slow service.

Chances are (very, very high) that you'll get there by car, because it's really a sprawling motel hard by I-8, surrounded by a giant parking lot. You'll pay about fifteen bucks for the privilege of parking there. You certainly would not have paid that - or anything - circa 1970 when the place was built with an eye on maximum value engineering and ROI for its owners. We stayed one night at the Handlery. We didn't see or use the pool, spa or conference areas, or any of the bar restaurants. This review is strictly of our guest room, which was located on the ground floor of the Point Loma building. It's one of three remote buildings separated by parking lots where guest rooms are located. Each of the guest room buildings is about 200 feet long, with rooms on two floors separated by, narrow internal corridors. Our guest room, with one king bed, was reasonably clean and well enough appointed, but cramped, not to put too fine a point on it. Everything was at a severe right angle and, with different window dressing, the room wouldn't be that much different from what you would find at a Motel 6. Outside our window, the cars were parked close enough to identify the species of insects splashed on the windshield. The bathroom was contained in approximately 36 square feet, a size that requires you to step outside to change your mind. The most discouraging thing about the Handlery were the smokers. Starting early and continuing throughout the morning, a steady parade of guests, some without shirts, many with tattoos, gathered outside the front door to smoke cigarettes, giving the whole place the cachet of an Alabama truck stop. Oh, and did I mention the $2.50 bottle of Aqua Fina that greeted us when we entered the room? And why not? If you can charge for parking, you can charge for water. What's next, air?

We were charged a $50 daily fee for possible expenses and a $12 parking fee, both of which was not explained to us at the time of booking.  Our room was cramped, the bathroom was so small we could not put out our personal items out  and it was dirty. (The toilet was disgusting!)  Obviously, the room had been used for handicapped guests in the past as the toilet was extremely low, the call button still in the shower area along with a hole where a hand rail had been and the walls of the tub were so short that there was not a possibility of taking a bath. The linen were old and worn, the bed uncomfortable and there was a constant blast of cold air that was blown where the bed was.  Yes, we left after staying only one night.  Oh, and don't believe your check out receipt!

608955834,"Phenom basketball recently held their camp here in San Diego in July and they highly recommended we stay here at Handlery. The affiliated price was still high so I booked the property months in advance through a third party for a little better price. Mind you now this was months in advance and things do happen. Do to an unforeseen circumstance we had to cut our stay one day short, thinking I get back the refund for the one night stay we did not use. That was never the case, I got the typical run around. Nancy at checkout said that I'd be charged a $75.00 penalty which I was okay with and that she'd send me my receipt via my email. Great! This was 4am in the morning as I was checking out, Nancy apparently decoded my room key and I couldn't go back to the room to wake up my son and get our things so we could leave for the airport. Twice I walked to the front desk, still unable to enter the building. Third time, I went back screaming my head off at Nancy to get security to meet me at the door.  Ten minutes past, still no security. Luckily a guest exiting let me in. What an incompetent front desk person, and a slow moving security personnel do they have at this hotel. When I later contacted the third party that booked my hotel, Sophie said when they talked to the hotel manager they refused to refund back the one night stay and now I had to contact Handerly myself to inquire about the refund. I never did get a receipt of my stay from Handlery  and when I talked to their Accounting manager Janae, she now says that I would need to get a receipt from the third party for my hotel stay. That is the first that I heard about a hotel is unable to furnish me a receipt for my stay. It only means that this hotel is not being honest and wants to rip off people like me and people like you. I calmly told Janae I will never stay at your hotel again. And this will be one of many reviews that I will be more than happy to duplicate on other hotel sites. Shame shame on you HANDLERY HOTEL! I will be back to take my son to the Phenom Camp again next year but will we stay at another place.I will voice my concerns with Phenom America to use another hotel next year....",-1,2,0.359957265

Ok, let me say that we had to change rooms twice. First room was in very back of bldgs with view of a concrete wall and an apartment building (bad). The sink was clogged so we moved to Rm #2 same wing. Could not get shower to work by pulling up spigot on spout, plus room right by security door which slammed every 5 min or so. Especially at night (ugh).  Moved to Rm #3 in Main Bldg. Nicer room with a deck overlooking hills and Hwy 8. High ceilings. Had a bottle of champagne waiting for me in this room (for the inconvenience?  thanks ..... appreciate that really I do).Bed was OK, not too soft, but fine. Bath is very small. Shampoos, soaps are fine.I did find the stay to be a bit pricey, but this is Fashion Valley in San Diego, and the prices are higher. Parking was included with my package stay. There was a wedding going on the Saturday night we were there so very crowded in pay lot. A beef I had....

Guess that was not their job.  The clerk was trying to check in a couple who had a language barrier so everything that the clerk told the female, she would then translate into Spanish for the male. So we just all stood there and waited out the translation session .... ugh! Would have been super nice to acknowledge that you had a customer just waiting and waiting... so I walked out.Well, won't be back again, sorry but too many negatives to the positives.Oh yeah, one more thing, you charged my husband $.25 for two sets of plastic cutlery wrapped in plastic.

137495670,"We stayed here many, many years ago.  We returned because of our good memories of that time.  However,  this (four-night) trip was full of many frustrating, disappointing experiences.We asked for the &quot;premier room&quot; because it was to include an outside patio leading directly to the pool.   However,  the patio turned out to have no view of the pool, no direct access to the pool(unless willing to leave your room unlocked), no lights at night, and was actually just a pathway.The hotel bills itself as  &quot;a smokefree property&quot;;  however, our patio received a stream of smokefrom down the pathway and from the pool area.  The premier room was supposed to receive adaily paper (missed one day),  daily water (missed two days), and bathrobe/slippers (never provided).  The sound proofing was inadequate:   We could easily hear all hallway conversations and some conversations in the adjoining room.  Room cleaning was disappointing some days, including bathroom items left by housekeeping were very greasy to the touch.  One day we returned to the room at 8:30 PM, and it was never made-up and cleaned (even though we called housekeeping at 2 PM to ask for it to be cleaned).The bathroom sink drainage was extrememly slow (it filled up each time it was turned on).On Saturday night there was extreme partying (loud screaming, running in hallway, people streaming in/out of the open door room across from our room) from 11 to midnight.  This may not be the fault of the hotel, but the way it was handled by management was lacking and feebleand not caring.  We and our friends called the front desk, and we were each told that &quot;they were leaving.&quot;  However,  for at least one hour no hotel employees appeared to confront the noise makers, and nobody was leaving.  The directions info provided at the concierage was not wellconsidered:  We were told we could easily walk to The Cheesecake Factory (&quot;a ten-minute walk&quot;).  It turned out that it was uphill and at least a thirty minute walk.  Not reasonable to givethis sort of advice to senior citiizens!  In conclusion,  while the employees were certainly courteous and respectful,  there was no sense of real caring or responsibility taken for thehotel failings we experienced.",-1,4,0.551683502

135025029,"Three weeks ago we stayed for three nights at this hotel. Out of all the hotes we stayed in during a month holiday in the USA (east and west coast)  this hotel was disappointing. We chose the hotel mainly due to the advertisement stating free Shuttle to Seaworld. This is true but with restrictions. You are told the time you will  leave for Seaworld due to limited seats on bus. We had 9.30 am and the last shuttle is 4.30 pm. We actually stayed until 10.00 pm for fireworks and Shamu's Night Rock Concert as this is one of the major highlights for Seaworld, so paid for a taxi. You also would not have seen all of Seaworld from 9.30 am - 4.30 pm anyway. When you pay for a whole day ticket to Seaworld you expect to be able to stay from the opening hours to closing time.  The hotel was very isolated. There is a trolley car going past the hotel which you pay and goes to Old Town. We ended up paying for a day tour to see San Diego. The continential breakfast which was included in the price was terrible each morning. I had mouldy grapes and sent these back to kitchen.  The restaurant is very tired, poor quality food and no atmosphere. There was no body on Reception so you stood waiting and then suddenly someone would come out of the back room They have camera to see the Reception so there is no friendly face. To book tours there is only a limited time during the day because the person responsible is only available from 9.00 am to early in the afternoon compared to other hotels that have a fantastic customer service virtually 24 hours.

At midnight, a group of black young men rushed into the elevator and exceeded the weight of limits, the only working elevator broke also, and these people were trapped in the box and rescued later. By that time, every customers needed to climb up the stairway. What made me even unsatisfied is the attitude and the service of this hotel, and thus made me down to lobby and climb up to my room several times. I found there is no hair dryer in my room, I called the service number. They told me to go to the lobby speak to the man on reception. The guy on reception said they don't have enough hair dryer for each room. He didn't say sorry and said that without any regret. What a joke. Hotels don't have enough hair dryers for each room. Is it a Sheraton? The worse thing is I found that he lied to me, they have spare hair dryer in the warehouse, only because he didn't want to serve me, even I am a preferred elite guest of SPG. I went to to the reception several times and insisted I need it, Finally the receptionist asked the security to fetch a dry hair for me. By the way, the bath room is big but very plain, totally waste of space, no bathtub. Most four points and Aloft would better than this hotel. Worst experience ever.",-1,1,0.509271284

OK it was around 8:30 PM and we had to wake up by 4:30 AM the next morning to catch an early flight, I hoped this would not take long.  We scrambled to pack everything back up and waited.  At 9 PM there was still no word from the front desk so I called.  Over the phone we were asked to come down to the front desk with all our luggage, kids in pajamas, and our room keys so that they would give us keys to a new room.  We were exhausted but we did as told just so we would be given a clean room for the night.  The new room turned out to be the next room to our old room on the 9th floor.  WHY DID THEY ASK US TO LUG ALL THE LUGGAGE PLUS OUR SLEEPY KIDS DOWNSTAIRS ONLY TO SEND US BACK TO THE SAME PART OF THE HALL ON THE SAME FLOOR??? IS IT TOO MUCH FOR THE HOTEL TO SEND SOMEONE UP TO HAND US THE KEYS? Too tired to argue I hurried to unpack everything and pushed the kids into the shower, the only toiletries in the tiny bathroom were a tiny bottle of lotion and 2 small bar soaps!  Where are the shampoo and the rest?  I would expect more from a motel than this!  At this point I was so done for the night.  We did not ask for room upgrade for rate discount after the ordeal.  All we asked was a little consideration for the hotel guests after the inconveniences.  For the kind of money they charge for this room and service, I will never ever stay here again.",-1,12,0.363623414

We were pleasantly surprised we were given a suite with an amazing balcony along with a dining and living area.  There was a a cold spell going on during this time of year and we tried to get the thermostat to get the heat working to warm the freezing room but to no avail.  The front desk couldn't get anyone to come and fix it so they gave us a space heater.  The plug was completely warped but we took it so our kids could sleep.  In the morning we requested a room change and the front desk advised they would move all our belongings to the new room and that everything would be done by the time we got back after our day excursions.  We come back to settle for the night, we got a new room but all our belongings are missing.  Bell hopper finally came to move the items that had been left in the previous room, tried turning on the heat yet again and nothing.  We would have to continue to use the space heater for the remainder of the stay.  We have never been so disappointed in a Sheraton property.  Upon check out, we stated our concerns and they comped us for parking.  We even wrote to Starwood and they felt the complimentary parking was good enough.  What a terrible  experience.",-1,0,0.511940837

When my wife went to check in thay told her the hotel was overbooked and would NOT be honoring our reservation. We even had the confirmation code. The front desk was very nonchalant. The worst part about the situation was I called on Friday the day before to confirm my wifes name on the room and they confirmed the reservation. She also called on Saturday to confirm she would be there at 8PM and they confirmed the reservation again. AWFUL customer service. As we tried to work this out with the manager (who was useless) several other Expedia guests were told they were overbooked and turned back. However the hotel continued to book in guests they booked themselves. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone based on this, plus there are plenty of other customer friendly hotels in the are.",-1,0,0.522727273
234942570,"I travel often for business and have stayed at many Starwood properties as well as other chains.  I have never had as bad as an experience as I did at the Sheraton Mission Valley San Diego Hotel.My family and I stayed for one night.  I always ask for a quiet room as my wife is a light sleeper.  Around 10pm, we started hearing kids running up and down the hallway yelling every ten minutes or so.  There's no insulation around the doors to the room, so the noise level was high.  I called the front desk and they said they'd send security up.  I decided to put on some clothes and wait in the hallway to meet the security guard and let him know what was going on.The guard came up, he was an older gentlemen who definitely was not going to intimidate any rowdy kids.  No kids were around at the time anyway, so I let him know that it had been happening for a while.  He said he'd keep an eye out, so I went back into our room.  Within 5 minutes the kids were running and yelling again. I quickly threw on my clothes and ran into the hallway.  I caught the kids as they were getting into the elevator.  I'm a parent of young children, so I did not curse or touch them, but I used my parenting voice and face and sternly informed them that this was a hotel and that they could not go running around the halls yelling.  I then rode with them in the elevator down to the lobby and yelled to the front desk to get security.The older gentleman returned and I asked him why he hadn't been looking out like he said he would.  He said he there was a wedding downstairs (where the kids were running back and forth from) and that he had already told the kids to keep it down.I told the guard that maybe it was time to get adults involved, to which he replied, &quot;I am an adult&quot;.  I explained that I meant the kids' parents and went back to my room.  Upon checkout, the front desk refunded me for the lack of sleep and headache, which did not make up for the experience.  A day or two later I got a survey from Starwood which I filled out with all the details above.  No surprise, I then get an email from a Russ Cyr, the Chief Engineer at the hotel.  He apologized for the bad experience and said &quot;The genuine care and comfort of you is my highest mission&quot; and said he would &quot;gladly pay for a one night stay and will send you a voucher&quot;.  I responded saying thank you and that I would accept it.Three weeks go by, without any voucher.  We call Russ Cyr and he says he's sorry he'll mail it right away.  Two weeks go by, so we call Starwood corporate 3 times in an effort to speak to someone who could help us and look into the situation.  Two more weeks go by and again no voucher, no points, no nothing.  We call again, and he said that &quot;it must have not sent&quot; and that it's happened with other customers too and that he would issue Starwood points to my account instead.  Three days go by and then we got a call saying that they would not issue a voucher or any points.  So after being led on for nearly two months, I'm now writing this review.Don't stay at the Sheraton Mission Valley San Diego Hotel.  They are poorly staffed, the service is terrible, and the staff are liars!  This experience has soured my opinion of the Sheraton brand and the Starwood brand.  I'm ready to transfer my loyalty to another chain who values honesty and customer service!",-1,2,0.404275794
147284863,"I have never stayed in a worse Sheraton hotel. I booked 8 king rooms weeks prior to arriving and arrived at the hotel to be told that we had king rooms only to find we did not! I contacted the main reception and was told there were no guarantees...you just told me we all had king rooms...lie! All of the rooms with the exception of one were booked on the 2nd floor, the only floor not renovated. (Even the renovated rooms were mediocre at best).  Yikes, the rooms on that floor should not be rented, they are BAD! One person wiped the handle of the bathroom door with a facecloth and it was shamefully filthy dirty. She had waited a couple of days for housekeeping to clean goo off of it and the floor but eventually gave up and cleaned it herself. One room received no housekeeping service and when it was mentioned at the desk the clerk said &quot;yah I am not surprised&quot;. There was no consistency in restocking of the towels or face cloths, it was a crapshoot as to what you would get. Here's the best part...every one us had to repeatedly get the room keys reset, one person had her key reset 6 times in one day. It was so ridiculous the staff should have been embarrassed but were very matter of fact about it. One room had sh%# on the light switch, again how did housekeeping not see this, personally I don't think they could care less and it showed. Those are just a few issues we had, I will be contacting the Sheraton head office to make them aware of the appalling conditions of their hotel and I will not stay at that one again.",-1,3,0.559848485

Elevators were ridiculously slow, room was dark and dingy and dirty. Lucky me, I discovered the next morning that not only did I have poor water pressure, but that the shower did not work. Lovely. I mentioned this at the front desk and they accomodated me for my troubles with a free breakfast (ugh) and comp'd my internet. To me, a working shower is an integral part of the Sheraton offering &quot;hotel rooms&quot; and am extremely disappointed more was not done to allow us to part ways nicely.",-1,0,0.702380952
125795998,"Don't be fooled, this is a Sheraton in name only.Simply put, do not stay here. My basic requirements for a hotel of clean, quiet, and comfortable went 0 for 3. As a Platinum I was &quot;upgraded&quot; to a larger room on the 7th floor. The larger room simply provided more surface area for the lack of cleaning and maintenance. After the room next door started throwing a party (not the hotel's fault) I threw in the towel and went down to the front desk and was moved to a 5th floor room facing the 8. Exact same condition as the first room (and loud), with added bonus of spackle where they've fixed the numerous holes in the wall. Dirty and stained carpets (I wore shoes walking around the room and slept in socks), furniture that wouldn't have been out of place in a dorm room that I wouldn't have sat on in a Tyvek suit, and a disgusting bathroom with shower pressure that can generously be described as &quot;San Fransisco mist.&quot; I ended-up rinsing the shampoo out of my hair in the sink.The door to the bathroom doesn't even open because the toilet is in the way. Free parking and internet for being a Platinum as well as Club room access. Unfortunately when they moved my room they didn't recode my key for club access and each trip on the elevator involves about 15 minutes (each direction) because of there only being one elevator in service. When I finally got into the Club lounge I found it to be overcrowded and picked-over so I threw in the towel and ate breakfast in the restaurant. Eggs were cold, but at least I didn't have to fight 50 other people. In the evenings you get to have conversations with the prostitutes hanging in the lobby as you wait, and wait, and wait for the elevator.  Gym is a disgrace. I've seen nicer gyms at Hamptons.When I mentioned the fact that the hotel should be condemned at check-out the Front desk cleark said &quot;oh, we know. But we're getting new carpets next year.&quot; Without exaggeration I've stayed in non-affiliation hotels in third-world countries that were cleaner then the Sheraton Mission Valley.

This leaves everyone waiting to check in with an antiquated computer system.  Supervisor Florence told me at 2:30 that my room wasn't cleaned yet, and at 3:10 she offered me another room with my parking complimentary and a free &quot;happy hour&quot; on my floor.  She then came back to the computer with my original room number, no paid parking and no free happy hour.  She acted surprised when I called her out on this and then tried to back track.  There are 2 elevators, but only 1 works.  Stairs are only for fire emergencies, so you are stuck waiting for the lone elevator for 13 floors.  Carpet is buckled on every floor, room we stayed in did not have a fridge or microwave, even though I requested one.  You pay for parking even though gates are open for everyone, you pay for wi-fi in your room, there is a &quot;marketing fee&quot; that is on your bill.  We were here for a softball tournament and there is 1 washer and 1 dryer for 13 floors!  $2 to wash and $2 to dry.

Reception area was nice upon entering. Based off of the other reviews I was not holding high hopes but just wanted a nice clean place for the family to sleep. All hopes were dashed upon entering the rooms. We had booked two rooms, one of which was a deluxe that cost more but offered more space. We went in to the deluxe room first. When I went to the sink to wash up, i almost threw up my dinner. The sink was beyond disgusting. It looked like someone had thrown up in it a long time ago and it was never  cleaned since it was all dried up. We went to check out the other room and realized that the key didn't work. Let me just say that this was late in the night (9pm) and I had an infant and toddler in tow. We then had to go back downstairs to get the other room's keys. When we mentioned the condition of the room to the front desk, there were no apologies offered. Instead They gave us new rooms and mentioned something about having housekeeping clean the room we were just in. So we go back, pack up our things, crying 8month old, and screaming toddler. We then move to the 5th floor and lo and behold, the sink was disgusting as well. The lights also weren't working since they were unplugged.  By this time, it was so late already and both kids needed to hit the sack. When housekeeping came to deliver the crib, we asked the lady nicely if there was anything she could do to clean the sink. Luckily she was able to clean our sink for us. But unfortunately for me, I'm lying here awake wondering what else was not cleaned in the room. Completely disgusted and I don't think we will be coming back after this stay. ",-1,0,0.625717172
462139215,I'll start with the positives: The hotel is quite nice for a 3 star mid-range hotel. The lobby is nice and the room decor is nice. The staff was quite friendly and helpful.The negatives: Road noise! We were put on the 4th floor in a room facing the busy 8 Freeway. The windows are not double paned and the road noise was quite loud 24/7. To their credit the staff offered to move us to a quieter room but that room had two queen size beds and we are used to sleeping in a King.I was told that the hotel is planning at some point to do something about the windows but I can't recommend the hotel until they double pane the windows to abate the road noise.,-1,3,0.575

I had to request a room change because of noise and I ended up standard room because all deluxes are at the same location.

I was stunned.  I went upstairs to find a bottle of &quot;shampoo&quot; in the tub but no shower gel.  As I was leaving for my business meeting, I asked my husband and daughter to get the car while I spoke with the front desk.  When I spoke with another staff member (Trevon, I think) about the tub and shampoo incident, he pulled out a basket right underneath the same drawer and gave me bottles of &quot;shampoo&quot;.  I then spoke with a manager Alexis who apologized for the tub and said she would let the cleaning manager know.  She asked if she could give me 10,000 points and I said no, and that I needed to leave for my meeting. While I was out on business, my husband and daughter stayed at the hotel pool.

The room had a privacy sign on the door but they managed to let themselves in to the room to deliver a basket but they couldn't take the time to clean the mold and mildew.

Then Trevor tells me, I have no balance and that they have comp'd the room charge.  Since I paid cash for the room, they are going to return the balance on my credit card on file.  OK.  As I am walking out, the lady manager who passed me up comes out after me asking what she can do to help.  I tell her about the mold, mildew, rudeness from staff regarding shampoo, no personal touch with the basket, and with her passing me up was just the finishing touch from this hotel.  Paula apologises and says she wants me to come back.  I said &quot;are you serious?&quot;  She says please give them another chance and she wants to give me voucher for a night stay.  I said fine and I wait while she goes in to get it.  She comes out and says the vouchers are in her car.  I wait.  Then she comes back to say she is all out and will mail one to me.

I called and left him another message on Thursday.  On Friday, I get a call from Alexis asking what my issues are so that the GM, David can call me back.  Are you kidding?  His time is so important but mine isn't that I have to explain it to Alexis before I can discuss it with him.  But then what can I expect from the GM when the rest of his staff is so unprofessional.  I have checked my credit card and still no refund of the room charges.  I am now waiting for a call from accounting.  When will this nightmare end?

In order to have some record of the incident, we had to write out by hand our own copy of events (since our computer had been stolen!) and request the manager to sign it!!There have been THREE different managers since this incident - an alarming turnover by any standard and which explains the indifference to problems - to just ignore them, and the appalling state of this hotel - our room was very tired looking and the carpet was dirty with many stains.We are SPG Gold members and have stayed at many Sheraton and Westin hotels without issue or complaint.  We have tried to be patient but the handling of this situation is unacceptable and we will be making a complaint to SPG as well.",-1,3,0.482037037
33487216,"My boyfriend and I both grew up in San Diego and know the area well.  We know that Mission Valley does not have 4 star hotels, but since we were attending an event nearby for his work, we decided to stay a quick cab drive away at the Sheraton.First of all, the moment I walked in the room it smelled of smoke even though it was a &quot;non-smoking.&quot;  The bath tub lining was falling off and the toilet barely flushed.  After calling engineering to tell them there was a problem, he told us thats just how they work.  The room was dark and looked over the motel syle pool. The TV remote did not work. The comforter was stained.  It was just one thing after another... We got ready and called the front desk for a cab to get to the event.  Knowing that it was only a 3 minute cab ride across the freeway, we called down about 10 minutes before we needed to leave.  Our frustration only grew when we were told it would be 20 minutes for a cab.  After waiting 25 minutes, now missing the opening speeches of the event, a town car arrives and asks us if we called for a cab.  We had waiting all that time because the girl at the front desk called  a town car?  He claimed to be a taxi but it was certainly a towncar service and I am positive the agent make some sort of commission. $15 dollars later for a 1.5 mile ride across the freeway I had had it.I paid a very cheap rate but even if the room were less than $100, I would not stay there.  It is dirty, secluded, and has poor service.  It was supposed to be a night of celebration that turned in to a stay of anger and frustration.",-1,1,0.429579926

My key card keep locking me out and the hallways were very dark, still and warm. Yuck. When I first walked in the room it smelled of Chinese food for good reason. There was a big soy sauce stain on the bed and on the yucky plastic bench. Did they move my room, no, but the maid did come up and within 45 minutes, two visits from her, and me cleaning the bench I was ready to turn in for the night. The bathroom was yucky, small and old. I slipped in the shower and hurt myself. I reported it to the front and asked it be fixed or a mat be placed in the room, but nothing happened. The room was very dated. There were lots of marks on the walls, stains, etc. The desk chair was broken. Later the manager told me the room has been refurbished, but I didn't see it that way.The club breakfast room was on the highway side and was very loud. The attendant was so sweet, but as I said, the room was loud and small and we weren't impressed by the offerings. We took our breakfast at Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf daily. On the other side of the highway there are many places to shop and eat. Jessica at the front desk is very kind. Nice and professional. If you make the mistake and stay at this place, I hope for your sake you deal with her, because if you have any dealings with Mary you will be sorry. We checked out two nights early because she was so incredibly rude to us. I've spoken with starwood and hotel staff and I hope they will come to a resolution about some credit for this abomination of an experience. The Mission Valley location is fine, but stay elsewhere. There are many many properties in the area and I so hope they are better appointed and have better service. I am ashamed for starwood that this place is part of their chain.",-1,0,0.526958333

At 11pm, there were still people partying outside at the jacuzzi being loud and obnoxious. The room was stuffy and warm, but we were so tired we just wanted to rest. At 1:30am, the room got so hot to the point that it was unbearable. The AC does not work. We were sweating like we were sleeping in a sauna. We quickly realized why it was the only room left available. We called the front desk and there was nothing to be done. There was one other room left but it is near the elevator. At 2am we decided to move to the last room available in the entire property (come to find out it was an upgrade), the front desk apologized and offered free breakfast. I told them we won't be able to wake up in time but thank you. When we checked out the next day, we told the guy our frustration. The guy basically told us &quot;we took care of the issue, we gave u an upgrade, we offered free breakfast, what more do you want?&quot; It was quite rude in a sarcastic way by using professional words. We never asked for an upgrade. We never cared for the free breakfast. We just wanted a room that's comfortable to sleep in. A simple expectation of going into a comfortable room and sleep is all we needed. It is not an outrageous expectation. We needed an acknowledgment of your mistake, your cause for disruption, then apologize and find a way of compensation that would benefit the customer. We do not need snarky remarks about a free upgrade we didn't ask for. We do not need free breakfast that we couldn't wake up to. Asides from the disruption in our sleep due to the AC and noise. The Wifi worked fine. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom amenities suffice. The hotel is a mile away from the Green line station, which took us to Downtown, Little Italy, Gaslamp, and the ferry to Coronado.We were treated like we were DYKWIA, when we just wanted a comfortable night sleep.

Well none of that was avaliable and I was left to feel as I was lying.  Why woould I book into a hotel that had absolutely nothing? Also the first day we were there I had asked the maid for some water as that was all we needed and was flat out refused.

There were poorly patched holes on every single wall in the room, including the bathroom ceiling. There were cigarette butts in the sliding glass door. The light next to the bed didn't work. The whole stay made me feel like I was treated differently because I used points for the room instead of paid using cash. At that point we knew that switching rooms wouldn't help since we were told the room would be the same handicap type of room even if we upgraded.  There was trash in the planters by the elevators in the hotel so the whole hotel looked worn out and uncared for. We also saw a door hanger marketing a green incentive - it said if you put the hanger on the door you get 500 points for each night you do not get your room cleaned. We put this on the door for the entire stay (as well as the do not disturb hanger) and didn't get the room cleaned, but I never received the SPG points. When we went down to the hotel restaurant for breakfast, it took a long time for anyone to even acknowledge our existence and take our coffee order. We paid for the buffet so all we needed was someone to acknowledge us, get us water and some coffee.  Almost every table was empty and we saw staff waiting around, but no one came to the table for quite a long time. Even then we got a carafe with a D scribbled in pen on the top so we don't even know if we got what we actually ordered, just plain coffee. I filled out the online survey shortly after our stay and even sent a follow up email 2 months after that and no one has acknowledged either correspondence. I asked for a refund my points used for the hotel nights and for the night we didn't get the room cleaned. The hotel made money from parking and the meals we had in the hotel so it is not as though the hotel made nothing off of us.

Unfortunately the hotel's TV was faulty and we were not able to watch the game. The excuse was that the satellite reception was dodgy, but we saw the game being aired downstairs in the lobby. Now, it could very well be the case that the lobby has regular cable and the rooms are hooked up to satellite TV. But that seems unlikely. They also proceeded to overcharge us for wireless internet. At checkout, when we mentioned that the lack of TV access was unduly frustrating, we were offered nothing more than a &quot;I am sorry.&quot;The hotel is also right next to the highway so it is ridiculously loud. Granted, we knew this when we made our same-day reservation, and we can live with noise, but the windows here might as well have been made of single-ply toilet paper.

Where to start... the room was just simply dirty and if the material quality of our room was representative of the current state of the other rooms, they really need to renovate this place. The attached pictures and their captions speak for themselves... Sure, they took $50 off my bill, but I would have rather paid full price and had a better experience... If I was looking to save money by staying in a run-down room, I would have booked a night at the local motel 6 so I wouldn't have to haggle with the front desk for a credit to my bill at checkout to match the service I received at this specific Sheraton. The best part, by far was that this room was marked as a SPG room... seriously?",-1,1,0.457539683
149650138,"Reasons to say No.1.  Hotel is ghetto.2.  I stayed during a home Charger game, hotel was fully booked.3.  there is only one working elevator for many floors and way too many guests.4.  When taking a shower, be sure the bathroom door is closed tight, if steam escapes it will set off the smoke alarm that is right next to the bathroom, this happened 2 times.5.  To make up for their discounted rates via price-line expedia, they charge for parking.  I find this very ridiculous especially since they parking lot was jam packed with cars and they only way to find a spot is if someone leaves.",-1,0,0.600859788

This bleak 16-story, 1980s tower fronts directly on the eastbound lanes of Interstate 8. But it gets better. It's also sandwiched close between two additional freeways -- the 163 and the 5!

Was checked in to Disabled room that have a faulty bathroom and shower, had to fix leaky toilet myself at midnight since they had no maintenance. Was clearly bumped from a normal room despite status and paying full price via Delta  App ($220 USD). In the morning I was offered a free breakfast as compensation - no thanks - I prefer a non-defective room. Furniture &amp; fixtures in room were clean but clearly dated + lack of maintenance on toilet and shower is very disappointing &amp; well below Sheraton standards.

49082694,"I picked this hotel to try something a little further away from the downtown area.  Upon arrival to the hotel I was impressed.  The front desk staff were helpful at first and offered to send up the refrigerator to my room right away.  The lobby is nice and so was the room.  I left the room for about three hours and came to find there was water near the tv stand.   When I returned, the ceiling was leaking and the refrigerator was not there.  I called the front desk and was told they would call maintainence.  I was stunned.  OK. If water is near and on the TV I can't turn it on so there is no need to stay in the same room.  I called the front desk again and got a different person who indicated he would move to another room.  You would think that I'd just get a new room and that would be fine.  Needless to say I upgraded to what would have been a nice suite if the traffic noise from outside was not so loud.  The room is facing the freeway and sounds like a truck is running through both rooms. My other room was better and was not noisy.The location of the hotel is fine since it is right near the freeway.  If it had soundproof windows this would be better.  I would never stay at this hotel again just for the noise factor.  The executive lounge is nice but that's not enough for me to stay again.  Try a cheaper hotel if you want to spend your money and still hear highway noise.  The parking here was free so that was a plus.",-1,0,0.548492865

The hotel was nice, but there were some things to be aware of.  The priceline site advertises there is breakfast, but there is not.  The front desk said people keep asking about it, but they will not do anything for you.  Our last night we got back the room had not been cleaned.  No towels and the bed's were not made up.  Not a huge deal, but when I called the front desk for towels they asked me over and over if I had put out the sign to not disturb.  I felt like I was on the phone with Dish Network.  Parking was a little difficult when the hotel is full and the hallway's were loud.

First of all, our rooms were not ready upon check so my group had to be split onto different floors.  We had the issue of the fire alarm going off when taking a shower which was annoying.  Hotel pool claimed to be heated but was cold.  The jacuzzi did not work properly and it was filthy. Room service was inconsistent.  Once, they removed our bath mat and they only gave us 1 extra shampoo even though we used it daily for 5 nights.  Gym was okay and breakfast was delicious but expensive.

I was there from November 13 - December 22.Jose Santana (bar) Niyoko, Kyle (front desk), Paul (night audit) and the African American Engineer (I forgot his name). These individuals understand the meaning of customer service. They're friendly, welcoming, positive and know how to treat guests. They made my stay A LOT less terrible. Now for the actual stay, this hotel is overdue for an upgrade/renovation, etc. Within the first few nights the pipe burst on the 6th floor, the night auditor (female/Hispanic) didn't  have a clue or even seem to care what was going on. She did not even move from behind the to assist with any questions or concerns. The phone, lamp and desk outlets did not work. I called for an engineer and while I was waiting for him to arrive my closet fell out of the wall and sheet rock is all in my clothes. They determined I would have to be moved, however they did not assist or seem to care how I made it to my new room. I asked Midge if I could have my room cleaned one morning and she asked me why?.. really? Who asks that question, especially in hospitality. Midge is very curt and cold. Armando in the bar has the personality of a shoe..... it's terrible. This is definitely not a full service property.

168914153,I should have know by how long it took the front desk reps to check in the two people ahead of us.  A week before our reservation we called to confirm the king suite and was emailed a confirmation of it. We get here and it was magically changed to a double room. The response we got was there is something wrong with our computers and there is nothing I can do to change it. This was not the expectation they set for us.

The couch was tearing at the seams and also had various stains, as did the digusting armchair next to the bed.  One of the pillows on the bed had a small, but apparent blood stain on it.  The air vent in the bathroom had a ridiculously large amount of dust on it, and it's no surprise that my son got sick during our stay.

220365221,"http://www.sheratonmissionvalley.com619-260-0111This will be my second attempt to write my review, my first one was not published for reasons you can read below.First review was written on my 2 day of a 4 day stay.First dayRoom appeared to be clean, in room safe didn't work. We went to the beach came back and my daughter took a shower, when she opened the door the smoke alarm went off. I called the front desk and they asked if someone had showered that the steam from the shower sets the alarm off. Wow, they gave us a room that has issues and they KNEW about it. Nice young man came up to fix the safe, they completely didn't understand that I didn't lock myself out that it wouldn't set at all. He couldn't fix it. But would have maintained come the next day and fix it. The next day I got my daughters up to take them to Comic Con (who the room was secured thur) and of course the smoke detector goes off all 3 times we use the shower. We left the room around 11. Came back around 3 and our room was not clean, safe still didn't work. Called the front desk and they were sending someone up to fix safe...again. Maid knocked on the door told her we would be leaving in a few minutes but she didn't understand because she spoke NO ENGLISH. Called the front desk and they said they would relay the message. We got back later that night and I called the front desk about the safe and smoke detector. Nice lady came up and determined the safe needed a battery, again they completely didn't understand that I didn't lock myself out that it wouldn't accept the final digit to lock it. Discussed the smoke detector and I explained it was unacceptable that we had to endure the noise each time someone took a shower. I suggested we bag it, she sent up ice bags and I taped off the alarm facing the bathroom door. It was fixed.Next day, left around 11:30 for Comic Con, got back at 5:03, room was not clean but safe was working and new smoke detector. I called down to the front desk and they said they would have it cleaned. We left to go back to Con came home around 8 and the room was clean. Later that night I tried to log onto the internet. It asked for my room number and notified me I would be charged $9.95 per day. After I got logged on I noticed the network was not secure. Called the front desk and got some smart aleck man who tried to treat me like a moron and said I didn't know what I was doing. (a) anytime they ask for a room number its for a reason (b) I took a screen print of the page that shows the network was unsecured. I thought I had signed into to phantom network and my information would be compromised. All he wanted to do was let me know how stupid I was. We didn't use the internet, my husband was unable to work since his information would have been compromised. Good news, we were not charged.The last day was okay. But I would NOT recommend this hotel. I realize Comic Con is a big deal but it comes around once a year like Christmas and I would think they would plan for this. But reading the comments from others I see Comic Con is not the reason for their issues. Pillows are horrible, beds are hard, mold in the bathroom other that than, Motel 6 might do you better.What a guest needs to think about is they put you in a 14 story hotel with faulty smoke alarms.  14 stories and they knew they needed to be replaced.

Walk in shower with a curtain on a curve that was to short for the shower. Hence the floor was automatically soaked each time as the water just ran down the shower curtain onto the floor.Put a bottle of coke in the small fridge and it was a block of ice in the morning, no adjustments for temperature were available on the fridge.Reported all this to reception but nothing was done.The corridors were being renovated and made these dark dingy alleyways even worse getting to the conference room.

There wasn't enough room to swing a cat in the bathroom and you had to squeeze behind the door to close it!The reception staff were rude.The only redeeming features of this hotel were the pool area (the hot tub is wonderful) and the cooked breakfast included in the price was tasty.Perhaps it was just the room we were given that was the problem as no one else seems to have had the above in the reviews I've read.",-1,2,0.53452381

Since my children have direct contact with the linens and pillows, it is the most important part of a stay to me, (The room was also desperately in need of a renovation). For this particular room, my wife made all the children sleep in their street clothes. When I challenged the manager, he agreed the pillows smelled but stated that the linens are changed daily and the actual pillows are replaced at least semi annually. He was kind enough to replace the soiled pillows with &quot;clean&quot; ones which did not smell, but when I asked him to show me a procedure or checklist as to the frequency of changing and replacing linens he could not produce either and could not tell me the last time the pillows were changed in our room.

Rooms are old, sheets had crumbs on them, rooms smelt of smoke and stale air,  heater was either too hot and no medium setting. Breakfast was a pain to remember to hand out pink slips supplied by the front desk, for coffee and toast and canned fruit. The hot breakfast which is standard in other hotels was $5.00 and that the eggs and french toast was dry and just awful. Dinner was too expensive to eat there and the buffet was a joke. I felt bad that my company had to pay for this hotel but I guess they were unable to get into the other hotel. We had about 10 to 20 rooms booked each week. Hockey kids were loud and noisy and security doors were never locked. Just a awful hotel and I am surprised that the BEST WESTERN still has this hotel operating.

The bed was very uncomfortable with less than adequate linen on it.  There was no comforter or duvet and the sheets were extremely short.  The bed itself was also rather uncomfortable.  The cold water tap in the bathtub did not work properly and took a lot of fiddling to get any cold water flowing.

We thought we'd book this hotel as it was associated with Gretzky's name..or so we were told. Thought it would be a nice hotel..but we were wrong from the get-go. The front desk clerk told my daughter our rooms were not ready despite her having booked them months in advance. When asked a simple question which required a simple answer, and then politely asked to repeat the answer, the front desk clerk became abruptly irate and extremely rude. Maybe she was having a bad day? We called for the manager as this was no reason to treat paying customers this way. The manager who was kind and professional..sent her away from the desk and dealt with us directly..also gave us free use of warming trays for the party food we brought in. We were upset but no big deal as we just wanted to get to our room and relax.However, I do have to give an honest review of the state of this hotel. It was absolutely filthy. Food trays from guests were still there in the hallways into the evening. You could tell the carpets were dirty, grimy and not vacuumed. They needed a deep cleaning and to be vacuumed on a regular. Halls had a dirty, moldy type smell to them. Rooms were just okay, nothing special. This hotel is badly in need of updating.

437077744,"After staying one night here we were disappointed with what is usually very good quality at best Westerns.Upon check in and getting to our room we noticed that the section we were staying in was under renovations and as we were in a hurry to get to where we were going didn't have time to really look at the room Getting back to the room late that night  is when we noticed how dated the room was The wooden chairs were very uncomfortable to sit in , we noticed mold around the bathtub and how dirty the carpet was. The beds were clean and comfortable so we decided to spend the night. The Breakfast they offered in the morning was very plain and not even tasty.They did not offer express checkout when we checked in and  just assumed it wasn't offered.Check out took almost 20 minutes as there was only one person at the desk and she was dealing with a problem.A few days later I received a survey about our stay , filled it in and sent it back,then we received another then another ?? I don't think BW even reads these .I even called customer service a couple times , had to leave messages and still have received any call back.Bad form all around .",-1,2,0.524642857

90847644,"I know people usually begin these reviews by saying that &quot;they never write these kinds of reviews&quot;... almost like a warning that their review is extraordinarily important, and now I kind of understand why. This is my first---and hopefully my last review, primarily because I understand that experiences are subjective and I would HATE for mine to poison the pot--like how spoiled North American travelers often do for hotels abroad or in the Caribbean. Anyway, I was extremely underwhelmed with the quality and services at the Best Western Brant Park. Let me get one thing out--- I traveled with my boyfriend AND my small PUG Vittorio... we booked online and called directly after to let them know we would be traveling with a dog (I knew from the Website that they allowed pets). What I didn't know was that their PET POLICY is EXTREMELY discriminatory. They have (4) rooms set aside for people traveling with Pets. These 4 rooms are all the same--side by side at the very back end of the Hotel, the farthest from the lobby. There was NO choice at all--- 2 double beds &quot;standard.&quot; Now I realize that we were traveling at an awkward time (x-mas eve to boxing day) and I expected the hotel to be semi-deserted and to probably not have maid-service etc. What I didn't anticipate is that the heating system must have been on the &quot;energy saving&quot; setting because the hallways and rooms were VERY cold...the carpets were filthy and the paint on the walls was a chipped mess. The restaurant was closed- fine-- we were going to my mothers to eat anyway... however the continental breakfast was ALSO cancelled---- when I asked for a rebate they denied. Even though they had no difficulty charging an extra 20$ onto the rate for my Pug.What bothers me the most is that I don't think this hotel understands that its ONLY AS GOOD AS ITS STANDARD ROOM, I don't care about the damn Wayne Gretzky wing or the upgraded mini suite with kitchenette or whatever they heck they are hocking in those internet photos... This place needs an INTERVENTION from the best western head office or something. For 160$ a night for a standard room during LOW season, I felt like they committed highway robbery on me. The room had a sliding glass door giving a view of the highway and a huge deserted parking lot, it was as if we were staying at a MOTEL, not exactly the Bates Motel, but something along the lines of a Motel 6 or Econo Lodge.What really annoyed me is that just because I traveled with my Pug I felt it I lost all my leverage to argue about the quality. I was treated SUB-HUMAN because I am an animal lover. I Understand that Dogs present some kind of liability to the hotel--which is why I agree with the 20$ extra charge and I agree that tipping the maid extra would also be a good idea, however- - - I am not bringing in a wild boar--- don't throw me in the COLD deserted back end of the hotel and charge me extra---Needless to say, I won't be returning to this particular Best Western...they have a discriminatory pet policy, the rooms are awful and dated, the maids and the front desk don't communicate with each other (the maids were knocking on the door asking when we were checking out---uh CHECK THE FRONT DESK) and the clientele is suspect.p.s I dropped a piece of a banana on the carpet at night and in the morning those little mini ants were helping themselves, it was COMPLETELY disgusting. I understand ants will inevitably come, but after only a few hours in the dead of winter--- I think a fumigation  may be in order",-1,0,0.4625

For some reason the hotel security system had been shut off for that night...convenient.  The staff at the hotel were initially kind about the ordeal, calling the police.  They even told us that there is a HUGE problem with cars being stolen from their lot.  Our issue was with the actually hotel manager....he was very rude and disrespectful and I will never stay here again.  We have heard from another outside source that this hotel has a theft problem, which is why we thought it odd that the owner's surveillance cameras were off the night we were all robbed...yes...there was more than one family vehicle robbed that night.The least teh hotel could have done was to refund our stay.....but the owner said that is not how business works.",-1,0,0.548461538

I was woken up several times per night because our room was right next to the mechanical room with machinery going off on time increments.  The cancellation policy for tounaments is not very useful, one hour after check in you have to let them know if you are staying for the second night.  Any parent at a hotel for a sport tournament knows that you only know if you are staying the second night depending on the results of the following day, not an hour after arrival.  After bringing forward all the points of noise, bed comfort etc the hotel still made us pay the second night when we under no circumstance were we staying a second night.

The floor was freezing, and even more so in the bathroom where there was tile.  The carpeted floor would normally offer some relief/insulation, but none of us took off our shoes because the carpet was gross.  It was my impression that the surface of the parking lot outside was more hygienic.The HVAC unit is one of those noisy old-school wall-mounted rigs; you know the kind I'm talking about.  I had to use the light of my phone to operate it because that far corner of the room was shrouded in darkness.  The heater only half-worked and took about 5 hours to warm the room up (I think we stayed in the room for about 9 hours total).In using my phone's light, which was stronger than any light in the room, I chanced to notice the debris inside the HVAC unit that you can see through the slotted vent covers.  That was gross and it's not right at all - what IS that stuff?  Like - it seems to be a breeding ground for bacteria/mold/insects.  I should have taken a photo with my phone as I was right there but I didn't tell my wife about it and I didn't want her to ask why I'd take a picture there.All of you reading this are travelers and have stayed in many hotels.  Have you ever walked into a hotel room and NOT found a shower curtain?  Ever?  In my 4+ decades on this planet I've stayed hundreds of nights in hotels ranging from fancy B&amp;B's and nice resorts to the Baytown TX Super 8 (where people get shot at the gas station next door), and have never failed to find a shower curtain until now.  After informing the front desk of such we did receive a shower curtain 10 minutes later but by then weâd decided that none of us wanted to take a shower in that bathroom.Speaking of which, I found a sharp wood screw on the floor of the bathoom that the cleaning and/or maintenance services somehow missed.  Hmmm - what was that from?  The door?  Something else?  Someone (like my young daughter) could have stepped on that.  Glad we kept our shoes on.  Keeping with the bathroom theme the towels appears to be original-issue from 1983.  And the faucet sprayed water all over the counter when you turned it on to wash your hands, which we did frequently.Being a taller sort, I got one of the double beds to myself.  It was purely random that the bed I used happened to have dried insect corpses (potato bugs?) on one of the pillows.  Again, didn't tell the wife immediately.  My entire family was freezing cold for several hours and we barely slept.But enough about me - my wife turned on the lamp on the night-table and immediately noted in the feeble light of the lamp the layer of dust covering it.  One wonders how long you have to go between room cleanings to accumulate that much dust.  It'd be say a couple weeks at least at home.  How many people would stay in the room in a couple of weeks between cleanings?  Unknown.  But, more than just you I'll wager.In the morning no one had a shower; we just wanted to get out of there.  I walked down to check out the included breakfast offerings; I returned to our room and told everyone that we'd be going to a restaurant for breakfast.  We did find Kelâs Diner soon thereafter and had a nice morning meal.  Before anyone doth protest that the breakfast is &quot;free&quot;, that's a matter of semantics.  We paid a fee which included breakfast in the morning - that makes it not free, and more of a subsidy for someone else.If it isn't obvious, I've given this place a 1-star review.  I've never stayed in a super-fancy awesome hotel like you see in movies but I bet some of you readers have.  Think about and envision all of the things that would make a hotel experience worth 5-stars; I bet there's more than I can imagine.  You will find none of those things here.If you want me to say something positive about this experience I will - it was quiet.So, in summary, this is a dated, dirty, poorly cleaned, poorly lit, poorly maintained excuse for a hotel.  If you combined 1980's era taste in decor with 1960's era Soviet apartment blocks and threw in a dash of 1880's era lighting and cleanliness, you might get the idea.  We paid $120 plus tax for THIS?  I feel like an idiot and deserve to be scorned.Actually, we paid $220 for this - even though our invoice was for the room price, Days Inn tacked on $100 for a security deposit and didn't tell us.  We found out looking at the VISA statement, not sure if it's been refunded yet.  I should check later.  Anyways, that's quasi-illegal business practices.  Now, I understand the need for security deposits - it's a common thing.  But let's step back and think about this.  If you saw all the items in room 119 (beds, lights, nighttable, bedding, etc) for sale on Kijiji and the price was $100 you'd laugh and shake your head.  Even if we stole everything out of that room and sold it on the side, I'd still be asking for change out of that $100 security deposit.Now now, I know what you're thinking: &quot;But Drake, if it was so bad, why did you stay there?&quot;  I'll tell you and it can be summed up in one word - desperation.

682712219,"  From the moment we arrived the front desk could not find our reservation made over the phone.   When it was found off to the side and the new girl at desk did not know about that Pile of reservation... the manager told her how to continue.  Then the new girl told me we had a room with 2 beds on the second floor.    I said no we book for a main floor unit and that is what we need.  The manager changed around the rooms for a Bus driver of a soccer team on the main floor.    I asked if it was going to be noisy with the female soccer teams.  The manager assured me they keep an eye on them and we should not have any issues.  Well we went to the family wedding, came back around 8 pm it was quite so we went for a nap.   We were woken up around 10 pm with doors banging girls running up and down the hall way.  We thought it would cool off by midnight.   We were wrong it kept going all night long.  We got up around 8 am;   I went to get breakfast for us from the cafe, when I got there all the food was gone.  Everything was empty.  No fruit, breads, milk, coffee, eggs, or bacon!   I was told by front desk that the kitchen was making more, so I waited, since no one came out one of the girls from the soccer team gently tapped on the kitchen door.  We waited, still no reply, so I banged on the door as hard as I could just in case they could not hear the knocking.     Finally the cook came out with 6-8 pancakes.  I asked her if there was more food coming she said as soon as she could since she was the only one working on the food.   I asked her if she had any help when it gets like this she sadly said no.  I went back to front desk and asked the manager if someone could help her she said no; there is only one person in the kitchen.    As she smiled at me asking how my stay has been.   I told her that it was the worst hotel stay we have ever stayed in.

I pulled the cabinet forward to extract my keys and I then realised just how filthy this room was. Together with my keys I extracted 2 chicken bones from the layer of fluff and dust that indicated the room had not been properly cleaned in at least a year. This made my look around the whole room and I noticed that the carpet edge and skirting on the wall was also covered in dust all around the perimeter of the room.

Still it had not been vacuumed away or picked up which was clear evidence cleaning was cursory at best.The High speed Internet (ha) was one bar and pathetic.The shower bath spigot change over partially worked so that at best you could diver 50% of water to shower head which leaked and sprayed  only a weak spray while the spigot on the bath provide another spray.The bed was very ordinary.Breakfast was at the lower end of the usual Super 8 standard. 2 tables in an area the size of a large bathroom. People waiting to find a seat, milk ran out - something always runs out at S8 breakfast. Is food rationed ?  Only grape jelly, no fruit, undrinkable coffee - never mind Maccas breakfast was down the road.I am writing this from my room on 9 August at LaQuinta in Sacramento which as usual is excellent.

I had to remove my previous review because a manager commented on my review apologizing for my experience (though also saying what I said was untrue), but also included my personal information in their response.  I contacted TripAdvisor, but the response wasn't quick enough, so I had to delete my original review to have my personal information taken down.  Maybe that was Best Western's intent?As for the original stay, the problem stemmed from several guests getting drunk and partying and smoking outside until around 4:00 AM.  I contacted the front desk multiple times and was told each time that they would look into it.  Each time, nothing happened.  I had an early flight, so I effectively got zero sleep that night, which really sucked.  To add insult to injury, the manager apologizing in my original review stated that it was an apartment complex next door and not their guests.  Total lie, as I saw the group of people in the Best Western parking lot sitting on cars.  Even worse, they lied further and stated that they reviewed security footage and there was no one there in the parking lot.  Again, I SAW THEM!  For HOURS!  Given that they blatantly lied about several things and posted my personal information, I will never stay with them again (any Best Western).  Horrible experience.",-1,4,0.37437276

As a place to stay and as a venue for a small (50-100) person conference, everything about this place works.

The location is great for those who want an island of calm after a busy day in Silicon Valley. Runners in our group loved the nearby loops and as a cyclist, I was able to find lots of variety and a good selection of burly urban riding to challenging and quiet rides in the hills.Food was outstanding, especially as a vegetarian, I really appreciate the imaginative and diverse meals, perhaps the best I have ever had in a hotel restaurant setting. Is there a weakness?  Well, the bar closed at 11:00 PM, which felt early given our scientific sessions sometimes ran until 10:00.  And $10 for a glass of nameless red wine feels a little steep for California but perhaps this is the price of the feeling of luxury.

I was with a group of co workers and they were all checking in with one attendant and I was standing there waiting to be waited on by another attendant and he was more interested in their conversation than helping me.  We finally were checked in and were given maps to find out room.  Yes it was like a treasure hunt to find out rooms.  The rooms were nothing special to say the least.  The carpeting and fancy draperies were nice but the rest of it was something you would find at Motel 6.  The chair in the room had stains on it of which I would rather not know what they were.  Disgusting......could we at least clean them please?  I noticed there was a Keurig single cup coffee brewer in the room which I thought was a nice touch till the next morning.  BROKEN.  The food there was horrible.  Overall I would say spend your money elsewhere if you are looking for something of this caliber and cost.

Sunday was another wedding with music so loud we might as well have been attendees. I understand that hotels need to host these functions in order to remain solvent, but the hotel also has the responsibility to warn their guests that their room will be directly over Party Central and offer an alternative. This hotel gave no such warning. We would never have stayed here if we'd known, and we will never stay here again. Our money was poorly spent. The management was unapologetic.

Upon calling to get a reservation with my group, I was told by the gentleman on the phone that only a manager could arrange that.  I asked for a manager.  He said he could leave a message for a manager and that it would be about 48-hours before I'd hear back?  Wow, that's awesome!  A 2-day response time.  I asked if there were a faster way to get to a manager.  He said that there might be one at the front desk.  I asked if he could transfer me.  He told me no, he couldn't do that.  What?  No, I'd have to call back and ask to get to the front desk.  So my first &quot;handshake&quot; with this property was to be told &quot;no&quot; several times and to have to do a boatload of work to make a reservation.Upon arrival, parking is so far away from the front area, I decided to get to my group first.  The grounds are big.  That's wonderful.  It's also annoying as no bell people are available.I walked across the wet grass to get to the main lobby.  There was one person working.  No... no... she wasn't working, she was closing out the computer.  Oh, wait, there's another person... oh, yes, she's working and she's actually friendly.  I wait for the people in front of me.  I don't mind the wait as it's a human I get to speak with.  I'm checked in.  I have a room.  Excellent!The room is fine.  It's nothing special.  The TV doesn't get satellite reception except for about half the time, so much of the time I got to see a nice &quot;LG&quot; logo on screen.  Nice TV, just no reception.Both drains in my bathroom were clogged.  The sink didn't drain.  And after my shower, I was up to my ankles in water in the tub.I called to have that fixed.  They fixed the sink.I had to call back to get the shower/tub drain fixed, though they noted having had that on their items to attend to.  Two hours later, engineering came back.The shower is made for people under 5' tall.  If you're 6' or above, you'll have to duck to get your face and hair.  There is a towel bar with two clean towels hanging IN the shower.  These get sopping wet when the shower head is adjusted above belly height.  The amenities are ridiculously sparse and not replenished.  I overheard two guys talking about getting &quot;one bar of soap&quot; and thought that they were just complaining.  No, it's true.  You get one bar of soap.  There's gel in a push dispenser in the shower.  But if you want to use soap in the shower, you have to take it back and forth from the sink.  There's a tube of body lotion.  Again, not replenished by housekeeping.  (This is another place where the desire to look like luxury fails big time and the place just looks cheap.)K-cup coffee is available in the room.  If you'd like, they also have brewed coffee back in the lobby area.  That's worth the walk.  Except, they don't have sleeves for the cups... or lids... or, on the second day I was there, they only had one cup.  So...  there's not really coffee available.Room service is okay.  They're the nicest people on the property.  Unfortunately, the food is cold by the time it gets to the room.  So the trade off is convenience and nice people for cold food.I had their version of eggs benedict.  It was actually quite tasty.  They offer orange juice on the menu, but when I found out it wasn't fresh squeezed on site, I didn't want to pay the $6 for it.  Housekeeping failed to replace the door-hanging card, so ordering room service the next morning had to be done by making a call.  That's fine, except that the phone didn't work.  I ended up using the phone in the bathroom.  Oh, and there was no-one there to answer the first time, so it simply rang, and rang, and rang.This place offered so many opportunities to be great and delivered so many times of being just horrible.Customer service style is &quot;It's not my job&quot;Customer service delivery is absent.I'd get better care and service from the lowest level of a Marriott chain (a residence inn or fairfield inn).  The Wyndham brand should be ashamed to have this property fall down so badly.I didn't even get points for this stay.  Thanks Wyndham... another customer service fail.",-1,4,0.488106576

The disappointment began as soon as we walked into our room with the a/c barely working and the refrigerator being so loud. Though I did enjoy the robes and the bedding. Fast forward to 8am and a jack hammer begins pounding the pool area, which we can see from our room window, then shortly after the construction began the house keepers knock on the door lightly multiple times to the point that I couldn't tell if it was really happening, then they OPEN our bedroom door and drop the check out invoice at 8am! (check out is at 12) I called front desk because this was by no means a $250 a night stay experience and then the guy leaves me on hold for a long time. I end up going over to the front desk and its so loud and there is dust blowing everywhere. I spoke to a different person at the front desk who apologized and agreed that oh yeah it sucks that they are jack hammering at 8am as if it was totally normal. He ended up taking 50% off our stay because the manager was not around and that was all he could offer me. There was coffee at the lobby in the morning but no cups and the guy said he had to call to the restaurant to get them to bring more cups. I mean, i work in the service industry and you just make things happen when you need things done, its not that hard. We looked forward to hanging at the pool and hot tub before we left but we had to leave on a rush around 9:30am.

No water was served at the tables. The hosts paid for wine and the banquet manager refused to serve it at the tables. Food was catered by a 3rd party -- the waiters did not want o serve the food properly. It was served in small bowls purposely. Waiters were rude. 2 desert statiosn were paid for.

We selected Dolce Hayes Mansion to give her part of what it feels like to be a Queen. Needless to say, it contributed to a disaster on my Mom's wedding. What would you do when you are in the middle of getting ready for your BIG DAY and asked to leave the premises by HOUSEKEEPING? This is with a notice on your check-in that you will require a LATE CHECK-OUT at the time you checked in. Needless to say, due diligence was not done on the Manager's end. OUR MOTHER'S WEDDING WAS RUINED! The make-up artist was rushed and our make-ups did not last through the entire wedding, this is due to rushing us and not all the bridesmaid's make-up was finished, the bride was hysterical because she has to rush and tell us we were getting kicked-out, the photographer did not take enough pictures as we were being rushed, we got delayed leaving the premises and cost extra fee for the limo. It was a mistake staying at this establishment... Instructions were not properly followed and it led to disaster.

The bar-tender told us we had to go out to the patio to be served. There were 3 parties of 3-4 people and two servers. They only served 2 parties-- those with open tabs. But, you couldn't open a tab if no server would take your card! After 20 minutes, I just went in and ordered from the bar-tender and &quot;forgot&quot; she had saidd before we couldn't do that. We were going to have breakfast at the hotel. But, after waiting 10 minutes to be seated in the half-empty dining-room (a hostess and 4 servers)-- they finally sat the one couple ahead of us.

The inside of the main building looks like an old museum and is a ghost town. To be honest, we were a little creeped out. The whole property was deserted.When we finally got to the room, it looked just as old as the rest of the property and the only window was facing a wall. I contacted the front desk to see if they could move us since it appeared that the whole property was empty but I the front desk agent, Rosa, was incredibly rude, curt, and uninterested with my concerns.After speaking with her we just decided to put up with the property stay because every other hotel in the area was over $300 per night.

After a single restless night and worse morning given the bathroom challenges and near overflow in the tub, we are looking elsewhere for a group event in the San Jose area.

He had a big ego and an attitude.  He could have told us over the phone that there was a problem with the card.  I had a card that worked.  Motel 6's rating is fast going down the tubes with me.  Recently, my husband and I stayed at a Motel 6 that said free wi-fi and there was no wi-fi.  I would give this motel a zero if I could.  The staff needs to work on their people skills.",-1,1,0.417989418

172243084,"First of all, let me comment on this &quot;modern&quot; look.  Motel 6 has stripped down amenities to the point where it is ludicrous.  There are no bureaus, no closets; nowhere to hang clothes except for two small pegs attached to the wall with 4 hangers. There is no coffee maker, no hairdryer, the ac didn't work, the towels are threadbare, and no alarm clock for wake-up. The rooms were smokey and the clientele looked like convicts, prostitutes and pimps. We were kept awake all night by loud music &amp; people partying into the wee hours of the morning. What was worse is that we locked up two expensive bikes and they were stolen.  The day clerk, Mayra, was helpful and saw that our money got refunded, but based on this experience we will never stay at a Motel 6 again.

I ask if it can still detect smoke and the kid says he will call. It is 7:25 the next day and I'm still waiting. Go to take a shower and there is no hot water, call the front desk, different guy tells me to leave it on 10-12 minutes, well 20 minutes later still no hot water. Call again, he says he will call me back. Going on 920 now, we are tired! Never called back, I call down and he says he will send someone up. 10:15 no one has come my husband checks the water for the 100th time and it was hot, so I called down to let him know and he hangs up on me!

244695760,"Last year my boyfriend and I stayed at the Trinity Suite at Leaside Manor. We had a very comfortable and enjoyable stay. We were anxious and excited to come back for another night and so we booked the Avalon Suite at the Compton House in October. This stay was the complete opposite of our last.Checkin was efficient and staff were friendly, however, we could feel the heat in the room as soon as we entered! We finally went to the office and the young girl there said that she had only been working a month and could not help us. We went to supper and returned to a room that was even warmer!! I called the emergency number and Natasha promptly came to see what she could do. Unfortunately, she couldn't get the ac unit working either! She said to open the windows....which couldn't be open! Natasha said that she would speak to management about a discount.We ended up checking out early as we just couldn't stay in the room any longer!  We voiced our concerns during check out and weren't offered any type of discount. I sent an email and did receive a $100 discount on our $268 room.For New years we decided to Try Leaside Manor again. We booked through Expedia and got a  room for $267. However, we were then told the room was not available (even though it shows as available on their website) I was told that the room only came with a New Years package (which is not listed on Expedia) and that the cost of the room is $394. I said that I wasn't interested in the New Years package and even though I had booked through Expedia and received a confirmation number I was told I could not get the room at that price.

341652740,"To celebrate my birthday my husband and I decided to spend 2 nights in the Trinity Suite at The Leaside Manor... Big mistake!  What we hoped to be a relaxing getaway left us feeling let down, ripped off and exhausted! There were several issues with the room itself; it lacked a comfortable sitting area, providing only high bar stools with no back rests and a window bench that was too narrow to sit and relax, the toilet was in a small closet with barely enough room to close the door and it didn't have a vanity mirror.. just mirrored closet doors several feet away which made applying make-up a little tricky and shaving nearly impossible.  Needless to say we were a tad disappointed with the room but we tried to make the best of it and we did enjoy the Jacuzzi and a great breakfast on Friday.   Unfortunately, the second night of our stay turned into somewhat of a nightmare when we were rudely awakened at 1am by guests in the suite next door. They were obviously drunk, laughing and talking loud enough for us to clearly hear every word of their conversation.  I called guest services to complain and it got a little quieter for a short period of time, but they woke us again at 2am and again at 3am, We actually considered checking out at 4am but we were both too exhausted to attempt the long drive home, so we decided to stay hoping to get a little sleep and enjoy a decent breakfast before going Christmas shopping as planned for Saturday.. but it was not to be. Deciding not to risk a case of salmonella from under-cooked eggs benedict,  we checked out at 8:30am, still hungry and way too tired to shop.  So, after a delicious breakfast at Cora's we went home to spend my birthday trying to catch up on some much needed sleep.  I have to assume that our stay wasn't typical of the usual guest experience as The Leaside Manor came highly recommended by several sources however, our plan to &quot;Escape the everyday&quot; resulted in a cost of nearly $400 for the most uncomfortable accommodations and worst experience that we have ever had in our frequent travels and visits to St. John's.  It totally ruined my Birthday.  Oh, and it gets worse.. I emailed Leaside to express my my concerns and was told that management would contact me in a day or 2.. That was 56 days ago!!!",-1,6,0.494488017
273347295,"At first glance, our room looked beautiful.  We liked the bathtub and the decor of the Argentia room.  The guy who checked us in was extremely nice and helpful with dinner recommendations. But the positives stops here.  Tired after a long day of travelling, we were looking forward to a good night's sleep.  We woke up at around 6:00 am because the bed was so uncomfortable and ''bouncy'' that we kept waking each other up every time we moved.  Plus, we could hear people talking downstairs, probably the cooking staff.  And every time someone went down the stairs, we could hear it. Boom boom boom. Not soundproofed at all.  I get that the building is old, but we want to sleep in when we are on holidays, so this was not ideal. The sink in our bathroom was clogged, so when we brushed our teeth, it would fill up and take FOREVER to empty. All of this made us pack our bags and decide to check out and go to Hampton Inn.  We called the office at around 7 to let them know and we were told the lady in charge was not there yet and that she was starting at 8.  So we waited until 8:15 and we went downstairs to check out.  The lady was not there yet.  We had to wait until around 9:00 am for her to show up. I have to mention that when we reserved online for a week, we got a price of around 179 a night.  It might have been more on the Saturday, but we are not sure.  They took a non refundable 250 deposit, which was clearly stated in their policy on the website. When we checked out, the lady just seemed to have an ''I don't really care'' attitude even though we told her we were not satisfied with our stay. To add insult to injury, she charged us 400 (250 deposit plus 158.00) for the only night we stayed, stating that since we left after one night, we were to pay the regular price even though we had reserved for a week with a deal. Oh and she told us that we were ''lucky'' not to pay an extra night (for the Sunday we left on top of the 400 Saturday we paid) because she could have charged us two nights.Lady, please, we left at 9:00 am on Sunday and the check out time is noon. We were really not impressed with the customer service in this place and because of that, I do not recommend this place.  The Hampton Inn was almost half the price and much more comfortable!",-1,5,0.510823985

18103574,"I use the Trip Advisor reviews regularly to determine where to stay when travelling, and until now haven't been misled.  I really don't know how the Leaside Inn came to be rated #1, and especially how it came to be rated over the Bonne Esperance, which is so much better in every way.We were put in the Jelly Bean Row room, which is right off the lobby and right next to the breakfast room, so we felt we had little privacy and were awakened early every morning.  The room was clean but right on the road, which tends to be noisy even at night, and the configuration of the bathroom is very strange, making taking a shower awkward.  We also found the room very warm and stuffy; there is an air conditioner, but it was too loud to keep running all night.  However, the room would get so warm when it was off that we had to get up several times in the night to put the air conditioner on.I will say that Elaine, the owner, is extremely helpful, and the kitchen staff are also very friendly.  (The strange breakfast situation seems to be that the first one to the table makes a request and that's what everyone else gets, like it or not.) Breakfast is made uncomfortable, however, by Elaine's husband, a British man who loudly holds forth on the strangeness of Newfoundland (and, surprisingly, openly ridicules Newfoundlanders, displaying the worst of old colonial attitudes. We were, quite frankly, appalled).  Last mark against the Leaside is its location.  For those who like to be on foot (and who don't want to cope with the difficult, expensive downtown parking), be warned that the Leaside is a brisk 25-minute walk to downtown.  My advice is to stay at Bonne Esperance, which is right downtown, on Gower, has lovely quiet rooms with windows that open onto an absolutely stunning garden full of restful chairs and loungers. We ended up there on our return from our travels around the Avalon and were glad that we did.",-1,0,0.561266146
403045975,"Let me start off by saying that my husband and I were initially thrilled that my sister had graciously gifted us a night in the Bakeapple Suite for our wedding night.  We had heard nothing but wonderful things about The Leaside.  Unfortunately, our stay was extremely disappointing and frustrating.  I'll start from the beginning.  My sister had visited the property to purchase a night's stay for us.  She paid for the accommodations in full and was told that she did not require a gift certificate for us.  However, she did request one so she would have something to give me to open at my bridal shower.  She was told a list of explicit instructions for us to follow on our wedding night as we knew we would be arriving late.  Upon arrival at the Leaside around 1am, my husband and I checked the mailbox where a key to our room was supposedly placed along with instructions on how to get to our suite.  Neither of these items were in the mailbox.  I had to call a number on the front door to ask to be let inside.  The gentleman on the phone said that there was no credit card on our account so they were unsure if we would be arriving or not.  I thought this strange, but never thought anything of it because it had been a long day.  He let us inside and told me how to get to the Bakeapple Suite.  When we arrived at the suite, it was bitter cold from the air conditioning.  There was a key in our door.  We were just pleased to have a place to unwind and sleep.  We slept, woke up, and went to check out.  When leaving, we saw a lady who worked in the kitchen.  She informed us that someone was looking for payment for our room.  I informed her that everything was already paid for.  She made a call and handed the phone to me.  Another lady on the other end said that there was no payment.  I informed her that it was a gift.  She asked me to go home and get the gift certificate and bring it back to the front desk.  I asked her if she could look up the receipt as I knew the date the certificate was purchased.  She said she still needed the physical certificate.  I obliged and left to drive home to get the certificate.I met my sister at my house and she was completely shocked at what had transpired, especially since she was told that no certificate had been needed in the first place.  She was even more upset when she found out our difficulties in trying to get in.  The icing on the cake was when she asked me if we had enjoyed our gift basket and champagne.  We did not receive the gift basket and there wasn't any champagne either.  When I called to inquire, I was informed that our basket was in the kitchen because when it was dropped off the day prior, the staff were not informed it was for us. I'm sorry, but this is not true.  They were informed, and somewhere along the way, communication must have been broken down between the staff.  The manager herself had informed me that she was speaking to my sister about putting champagne on ice for us, which also never happened for one reason or another.  At this point, I was rather upset.  It was suppose to be a special night and instead I was on the phone speaking with a manager about a gift certificate, not being let in, and an undelivered gift basket and champagne.  What really upset me most was the fact that I felt like they took no ownership over the nightmare stay.  I was even told how I should of understood that a gift certificate was necessary because its just like when you go to WalMart to make a purchase.. you need to physically have it.  Also, everything was &quot;apparently this happened&quot;â¦ not &quot;We're sorry for the inconvenience&quot;.  I felt like a belittled child who got in trouble at school.  Ridiculous considering they were the ones who were in the wrong.  I spent the whole morning playing phone tag with the manager.  She offered to let us keep the certificate and to return for another night's stay.  I asked for a refund instead- not wanting to stay another night.  I was told that since I stayed in the suite and availed of the breakfast (an assumption that was untrue because we weren't informed about breakfast), that they could not offer a refund.  I asked to speak with the owners.  The manager said she contacted them and unfortunately nothing else could be done. Finally, after much frustration, I agreed to a reissued gift certificate, which was supposed to be sent to me in the mail.  Here we are, 18 days later and I have yet to receive the gift certificate.  This whole experience has been very disappointing.  I will not be recommending the Leaside Manor to anyone.  It's a shame considering its a beautiful property.",-1,0,0.598215939
50764484,"I felt let down by tripadvisor on this one.  When we left, I found out the reason there were so many glowing reviews of this Inn.  They strongly suggest that you leave a glowing review here after your stay, as they're probably well aware that many people are swayed by the high ranking on tripadvisor.  There was plenty wrong with our visit for an inn ranked number one and charging fairly high prices.  I'll start with our first night:We were staying in the largest and most expensive suite, which was across the hall from the live-in night duty person, who on this particular night was enjoying drinks with her girlfriend.  Although that was a little unprofessional, it was the banging and crashing that went on till well after 3am in the store-room right behind the wall of our bed head that caused the most distress.  We couldn't work out for the life of us what that was about, just that it went on for a long time, and ruined a very needed nights sleep.The decor:The house itself is a beauty, and our room had gorgeous beams and was very large.  Unfortunately the 'interior designers' (or should I say the proprietor's) taste can only be described as garish, from the fake fireplace to the bits of fabric hanging over the bed.  What a pity, for the bones of the house are amazing.Breakfast:Having to spend time with the owner over breakfast was pretty disturbing.  I read someones description of her husband as considering himself considerably more cultured and 'better' than the locals, and can only say the same about our 'host'.  She clearly considered herself full of wordly charm, however, I can't say we felt the same.All in all the place left a bad taste in our mouths, and was by far the least pleasant place we stayed during our months tour of Newfoundland/Labrador/Northern Quebec.  As others have mentioned, there are far nicer places to stay right in town which allow you to walk to dinner and afford you beautiful views of the harbor.

There were only 9 rooms booked and the room they gave me had to be the worst in the place--why they would give this terrible room when I had a reservation is a mystery.  I opened the door to the room and there were about a dozen flies in the room.  I was really tired after a long drive so all I wanted to do was watch a little tv and sleep.  Lights off and within 10 minutes a moth the size of a bat started flying around.  Shut off the tv opened the door to scoot the moth/bat out--next morning bugs on the bathroom floor.  Then I realized that there was a gap all around the door for the bugs to come in--looked like the door was pried open and the door did not fit.  I could see daylight all the way around the door.  I asked the new owner to do something about the bugs before I returned--he assured me he would call the bug guy and it would be taken care of.  LIE!!

I have five children so I booked two rooms (requesting they were together of course). We were given rooms on opposite ends of the hotel on the second floor. I think my two-year old could fit through the railing upstairs. The hotel was rundown but they were working on it. One of the rooms had a queen bed and a pull out couch (really?--not even two full beds). The pull out was broken and the room stunk like cigarettes. When my wife went down to tell the front desk the pull out was broken and we needed a new room one of the front desk clerks swore and mumbled under her breath about people complaining all the time. They other front desk person got us a new room (still opposite side from our first room but it was clean and didn't stink of smoke). My brother also rented a room at this hotel and his room smelled like cigarettes too but they didn't say anything. Breakfast was fine and the nearby froyo was good.

Good to know for the future, but what about this visit?We were given a first floor room, #128, which was good.  We opened the door and while it looked clean, the smell of smoke was overwhelming.  As non-smokers, we just couldn't stay there.  Also there was a tear in the carpet by the front door.  It was obvious by that tear that this room had been a smoking one and the carpets had not been replaced since then.I called the front desk and asked for another room.  I went to get the key and passed by the stairs to go to the second floor.  They may have been safe, but did not look like they were -- older and metal, looked rusted.We were given room #138, and when opening the door, discovered that it smelled even more like smoke!

284876963,"The Truman Inn is a fairly clean hotel located off the Interstate about 30-40 minutes from the airport. We were in town for the Rolling Stones Concert and every hotel was sold out close to the stadium. It was a 10 minute drive ($13-15 taxi) to the stadium. The reason I feel the need to review this hotel is to let guests know that they canceled our reservation the day of our arrival. I called 2 days prior to confirm, informed them of our late arrival (2am) and was told sure no worries. When we arrive the front desk says we were canceled at 6pm that evening in the computer system because we had no credit card on file. I had booked Saturday night through Expedia and my friend called and added on Friday with a front desk attendant over the phone. We were never told that we needed another credit card on file. No one called to ask if we wanted to use the card for the Expedia reservation. Don't you think if we thought we needed a credit card on file to hold the room we would have provided it, knowing every hotel was sold out because of the concert. Thankfully someone had declined a room because the air conditioner didn't work. That was all they had so we took it. It was now 3 am and no other hotels had anything. On top of that we were told we had to check out by 11am to switch to our Saturday reservation. The whole point was to sleep in so I could be rested for the concert. At 10 am the next day my friend goes to the front desk and we are told we can stay in our room. Mind you I paid for a king room, this was a queen room that had no a/c and smelled like mold. We were never offered anything for the lack of customer service. We asked if we could get a late check out Sunday and told we had to leave by noon or we would be charged another day.

The hot water was questionable---the only way to get a warm shower was to NOT turn on the cold water, and even then you were doing a dance in the shower...cold water jump out, luke warm water jump in, repeat until you are finished or tired.

I explained that I needed a room with kitchenette but the guy on the desk had to empathy . He said that the room I had previously booked , was ready for guest who were arriving the next day . We couldn't have it. After a distressing conversation we were given a filthy room for one night then moved to a room with a kitchen for the next two nights. The better room was ok.

The view across the San Francisco Bay was gorgeous although it was foggy most mornings that wasn't the hotels fault.   We never give bad reviews as we are not fussy but although we enjoyed our stay to a certain extent the downfalls were :-- The room smelt really weird like must or cats-We chose this hotel as the only one in our price range with a pool but when we got there it was closed - the reason we were given was that there was a new American law that all pools needed a disabled chair for access (which we knew was true as all the other hotels we had stayed at had them) but what we didn't realise was this law had been in force for a while and the hotel hadn't got the chair so had to close the pool.  Even when we advised that that was the reason we had chosen that hotel obviously they couldn't do anything about it.-the restaurant closed at 4.00pm so we couldn't eat there unless we got in really early which on a 2 day whistle stop tour of san Francisco was impossible.-the hotel is not central to San Francisco and although has lovely views and there was a bus for 2 dollars per journey to downtown san Francisco it was a 3/4 hour trip each way with some dodgy people on it especially at night-the restaurants for the area around it all closed at 9.00pm so it was very limited where you could eat unless you got the dreaded 3/4 hour bus to downtown.-we did find a brilliant restaurant called Pacific CafÃ© which was about 7 blocks away that did still close at 10.00 but we managed to get in at 9.30 one night.  It was a fish restaurant which only sold fish so if you don't like fish you are stuck but if you do it was the best restaurant I have been too.  Very authentic, nice staff, gorgeous cheap food and you also get a complimentary glass of wine on arrival - good for me.all in all san Francisco had two sides to me - loved fishermans wharf and the trolley cars - but not quite sure we chose the best motel in the right location",-1,1,0.57035022

287769366,"I really would love to give this place a five star rating as it appears to be a family-owned enterprise, in a great location.  But, I just can't.  As it is, the two stars is a bit generous.POSITIVES:- Like many other reviewers have noted -this is a near-perfect location.  Partial views of the ocean, walking distance to many parks and trails. Easy drive or bus ride to just about anywhere of note in the city.- Many of the rooms are a good size.- Ease of parking and parking is free.- Adjoining restaurant.- Nice small hotel.But... the management has blown a great opportunity to present a class-act boutique hotel.  Instead of being something wonderful, it comes across as a place where they are really, really cheap and don't want to spend a dime to refresh the place and make it inviting.  They seem to be full most of the time... maybe this is why they don't seem to care if they spend any money on the place or not.NEGATIVES:- Old, outdated and somewhat dirty furnishings.  I was in three different rooms... our own, and the rooms of two friends and it was the same in each case:  old and dirty carpet. Old and dirty bed covers. Furniture is laughably bad -- looks like it came from Goodwill about thirty years ago.- Noise:  There is no quiet place here.  Rooms face either 48th Ave or Point Lobos Avenue.  Rooms facing Point Lobos get constant street noise.  Rooms facing 48th get constant bus noise... there are nearly always 2 to 4 busses lined up here.  If you like to open your windows, there is a fair chance you will get diesel fumes in your room.  - Old and creaky -- if you are not on the third floor, you will hear every step taken above you.- Something living in the walls:  Perhaps they just wanted to give us some extra entertainment, but I would swear that there is something alive in those walls.-The Elevator: words can't describe it... has to be experienced to be believed.What a shame... this very good location, one of the few hotels on this side of the city, and the owners are just letting the place run down.",-1,6,0.501160494

The staff, even after making some major mistakes, were apologetic, cooperative, and accommodating.  And they discounted our bill (which we deserved).CONS:  We reserved the best room, which was given to someone else with a similar name.

It was also on the side of the inn, which, sadly is where the city busses stop to reset their schedules so all night long they would start their engines, move up twenty feet and shut off again.  There wasn't any air conditioning so we needed to keep the window open.

Huge mistake.   The room, though clean, had not been renovated in any significant way since the 60's.  Even the most basic cosmetic improvements were ignored, including patched wallpaper in the ancient toilet, funky old rugs, bedspreads and a generally gloomy ambience, that for the nightly price of 175 dollars was absurd, considering the ready availability of cheaper, more modern and centrally located hotels downtown.  I got the impression that the owners had a &quot;take it or leave it&quot; attitude toward the customers.  If this lack of attention to renovation was intended to add to the &quot;charm&quot;, it fell very short.  We have traveled extensively throughout Europe and the US in every style of accommodation.  Believe us when I say that this place is sub par for the price.   I would best describe this place as a tired, cheerless place with no charm whatsoever, and is comparable to the youth hostels that one can find in foreign cities.

5012645,"We arrived at the Seal Rock Inn after a long day of driving.  My first impression was that it definately did NOT remind me of a 1950's national park lodge as described in a travel book I had picked up.  It is on a relatively busy street corner and the sound of city buses is prevalent.  My second impression came to me as I looked out the window - yes, we could see the ocean from our third floor window- but in the foreground, I observed an apparent homeless drunk sleeping in the bushes across the street.  After several minutes, he woke up, staggered several steps, urinated in the plants, stumbled several more steps and lay down to sleep again.  As I looked around the fairly shabby room of questionable cleanliness, I thought &quot;Oh my God, I can't stay here with my family.&quot;     But, I tried to set a good example for my kids and roll with the punches.  Amazingly we had a quiet night sleep.  The buses stop running and the traffic outside dies down.  We had a roomy third floor room with one queen and two twin beds, so the kids were happy to each have their own space.  The next day we took the bus downtown.  The &quot;end of the line&quot; is right across the street from Seal Rock Inn.  So the bus was empty when we first got on, and there was standing room only by the time we got off.  But it was a great way to people watch and meet some of the locals who live by public transportation.  Many were quite friendly.  We did our sightseeing thing that day and returned tired once again by bus.  It was nice to not have driven in the car for a day, but one day of bus riding was enough.      The next morning my husband and I got up and walked to a charming diner down the hill.  We had breakfast and a spectacular view of the ocean and the Sutro bath ruins.  The neighborhood was looking a little better.  Later, we drove ourselves to Fishermans Wharf and found a parking garage for another round of tourist stuff, which worked fine too.     Originally our reservations were for three nights, but we decided that two were more than enough.  We cancelled our third night and opted to return to an airport hotel that we knew would be clean and reliable, we had an early flight in the morning anyway and we'd seen most of what we came to see for this trip.     In summary, Seal Rock Inn has potential to be a very nice place in an interesting location, but it needs major updating.  Most of the staff is friendly, but they reside behind glass in a small office off a non-existant lobby.  It doesn't give the guest a very confident feeling about the neighborhood.  Free parking is a definite plus.  And the price of the room was looking pretty good after experiencing how expensive everything in and around San Francisco is.  Still, if we ever find our way back to San Francisco, we will probably save our pennies and pay more for a hopefully nicer place.",-1,0,0.496652864
137329420,"We recently stayed at this hotel because I had read about it in Tales From The City (this should have been my first clue as these books were written in the 70s). After a quick check on tripadvisor, I saw the great ratings and booked a suite for 4 nights. What an unpleasant surprise we had when we arrived in the middle of the night. The front desk staff was unfriendly, the elevator (side-panelled with carpet) smelled musty and dirty. The room smelled so bad, we almost gagged. The carpet was covered in dark brown spots, so nobody dared to take off their shoes. The ocean view was obstructed by some kind of dirty film on the windows, making the room even darker than it already was. The pool, if you dare call it that, was covered in dirt and grime and was very small. As it was late, we decided to tough it out, heald our breath and went to sleep. The next day we asked for a cleaner room and were basically told to put up or leave. We then went out to breakfast, because the hotel restaurant had the same grimy film covering everything. When we came back, the manager did have another room for us all of a sudden, which was slightly better. The carpets were still nasty, the window was cracked, but they had sprayed the room with some type of spray, which (at least temporarily) masked the musty/moldy odor. We would have moved to another hotel, but SF was booked solid in August.On the positive side, the suites were very spacious and the location is just awesome. We wanted to be away from the city, closer to nature and for that this location cannot be beat. The area is great for jogging, taking walks and heading to the beach.If I had the funds, I would buy the lot, tear down the hotel and build a new one from scratch.

Door in our room seemed to have had an attempted break-in as the wood was split near the lock. Weird smells as if someone was cooking food in the building. Toilet seat was not securely fastened and required quick reflexes to ensure you wouldn't fall off. Paper-thing walls. No garbage cans anywhere in the room. The worst part of the stay was as we were checking out on the fourth day, finding someone else's takeout food garbage in the drawer of the dresser.

That's what his point is, Free WiFi means you get what you pay for. Nothing. Nada. Zip. Seems like you would expect more, when they hold themselves out to be something more than a classless hotel.

Can you imagine my horror when they said &quot;bedbug&quot;?After I saw the pictures on the website, I wish I had taken photos in our room. Room 216 looked nothing like the photos on the site.The furnishing were old and dingy. The room was extremely cold when we arrived. We turned on the baseboard heater and waited for it to get warm. And we waited .....and waited. It took five hours before we could actually take our coats off. The furnishing were sparse at best. There was the requisite bed, lamps and dresser (with goo stuck to the bottom of the drawer). As a bonus, there  was a small refrigerator. However, there was no ironing board, iron, coffee pot or clock. But there was free parking and the room was large. The bathroom was newer and did have a tub/shower. The water pressure was virtually nonexistent. Once we finally got warm and went to sleep, our neighbors had a lover's quarrel and were screaming from the balcony at 4 am. I realize this could happen anywhere, but it just made a bad night worse. And then we found the bedbug.

For the price paid it is substantially lacking.  The rooms were not clean, the outside walkway to the rooms was filthy.  The room service was unreliable.   Ice promised at the office was not available.  The manager, who was not very interested in our complaint of noise, was not even professional enough to give us his surname when we asked his name.  The two men that we dealt with at the front desk were perfunctory in their response to appropriate questions, such as where are we to park?  The thick plastic window separating the front desk personnel from those who walk in certainly put us on notice that personal safety may be on the inside of the office and not the outside. Interesting and open hand-to-hand transactions at automobiles each evening in the parking area in front of the hotel would cause many concerned managers or desk personnel to notify the police of possible criminal activity.

119457286,"This Motor Inn (not a hotel) in any other area would be rated a 1-star for the following reasons:The desk clerks (male and female) are behind a security glass window and all transactions are made via a slide-through access similar to banks so the initial impression is not a good sign.  I, as well as the previous review, was annoyed that I had to pay up front for the room ($175/night for two queen beds) and I agree this is non-standard and made the place seem sketchy.The hallways are exterior, facing toward the road and cars pull in vertical to the rooms.  The entrance doors to the rooms sit less than 30 feet from the street so there was constant traffic noise that we heard from the interior of our room.There are obvious, big security cameras facing all exterior hallways (another bad sign).  The exterior of the hotel is in dire need of repair, In various places of the hallways there are areas of disintegrating stucco, there are no screens on the windows and the rooms' entrance doors and locks are badly scratched and worn.Inside our room, there were two queen beds, two pillows on each bed, no extra blankets.  There was an 18&quot; tube TV (!), no internet or WIFI.  The air conditioner was a wall unit that roared all night long and we had no choice but to use it for some kind of room ventilation  because we didn't feel safe to open the window for fresh air.   There was a granite 12x12 patch in the granite shower because the mixer valve was leaking and it had to be repaired.  There is no blow dryer. The toilet was crooked, the towels and washclothes were rough and dinged yellow.  The shower was slow to drain.  The shower curtain at the bottom was moldy and had a horrible odor.   There were stains on the wall behind the toilet. Maybe this Motor Inn justifies its $200 ($175 including taxes and hotel fee) per night rate because its the only hotel located just south of Golden Gate park on the Great Highway across from the ocean, but you have to cross two busy streets to get to the ocean.  We stayed at this Motor Inn because it was close and convenient to the special event in Golden Gate Park so I assume the exorbitant rate was the gouging by this Motor Inn for the special event.

The staff was friendly, I imagine they must be frustrated as well.I wouldn't bother with  a review except for this: I want this place to be better.

I call downstairs to say how I reserved a room with two beds and the first thing the guy says is he doesn't want that many people and he wants me to leave. I say fine because I've had enough of the dirty, smelly, and broken place.

There are more hotels near there, and they can be had for about half the $85 dollars I paid for this place!!My wife just reminded me that there was no shampoo or conditioners provided in the room and that the towels were old and scratchy.  Also there were no fans in the rooms and no way to open the windows for fresh air.  Although with the noise from the bar we wouldn't have been able to open them anyway.",-1,2,0.449808429

It is near Ocean Beach and close to the N Judah Street Car.  So far this sounds ok.  Was going to stay here with my elderly mother and shuttle her back and forth to the hospital.Surgery went well, while Dad in recovery room, went to check into the hotel.  Was not expecting anything fancy at $99/nite in San Francisco.Drove out to motel--it is built over a bar!  Not any bar, but a bar with barred windows, several chopper motorcycles parked outside and a pretty rough group standing outside smoking!  This was at 3PM.  Decided to look inside hotel,  reception desk had bullet proof glass!  Room had a funky smell.

This hotel was close and when I called and told the manager &quot;Bob&quot; my situation he gave me a decent quote. When I got to my room I was in shock. Not only did upon me opening the door was I overwhelmed by the smell I was shocked by the room condition. The room was filthy, the rug was stained, the walls were stained and covered in a film. I opened a window to try to air out the room and was surprised to see that the window which was 2 feet from where I was to sleep, had no screen. I then went into the bathroom and gasped. The shower head had mold in it, the &quot;vanity&quot; was filthy, and the vent fan that was in the shower had open wires. The floor in the entire room felt like it was going to cave in. The room phone was covered in so much grime. The walls and flooring were coming apart and had mildew in them. Above the headboard were stains from ciggarettes, and the &quot;heater&quot; in the room looked like it would explode even if I looked at it wrong. After all this I go back to my car to place my luggage back in it and discover in the stall next to me a needle that still had some fluid mixed with I would assume was blood. I then went to the front counter to get my money back and the manager refused. It took me threatening and looking up the health board on my phone and calling them in front of him that he gave me 90% of my money back. He kept 10% for housekeeping fees. I would never recommend this establishment to my worst enemy. I seen some of the pictures they have placed up and I got to say I dont know where this is. I took some and see for yourself.

While I was in this piece of dump I realized I had to get out of there quick, but since it was almost midnight, I had NO choice, not to mention the parking space is limited to like three cars or something. This place is really something, the bathroom and the bedroom was horrible and the street noise was so intensly loud it felt like I was in the movie theathers (without the enjoyment). Also the carpet was like crawling heavily with bugs and fleas and kept biting me and my boy badly. I hate bugs in hotel, they tell me that the hotel is not a good establishment and should be regulated strongly by the federal government or something. Please I just want to get rid of this memory of horrendousness and terrifying noises that seemed to penetrate my soul with a huge sword of doom. The only good part about this &quot;gate to the underworld&quot; was the closeness and the relative ease at finding the resources like groceries and stuff. This was not enjoyable for him or for me.

The rooms are about 50 feet from the Muni train line and they run from early morning till midnight or so. So every few minutes the room literally shakes as a train loudly goes by. Additionally, the hotel is over a bar, so loud and enebriated patrons spend the night outside yelling at each other till closing time around 2 am.  The room itself was very old and run down. The entirety of the available power outlets were on a power strip running from behind the dresser. The window to the fire escape has a pretty wimpy latch, and should be pretty easy to open from outside.

It would never have been my choice to stay, even if I had to drive 25 miles to a better facility, but our associate had taken it upon himself to make a reservation for us and we were kind of stuck.  I had a reservation at the Holiday Inn Express in Belmont for only $75 per night (weekend rate), and when I tried to explain to the hotel clerk that there was miscommunication between our associate and us, and that we already had a reservation elsewhere, and he rudely and adamantly refused to cancel our reservation without penalizing our associate for the full rate of $95/night.  So we made due and stayed there, and the room was terrible.  We could clearly hear our neighbors chatting in the room next door, could smell their smoke as if they were having a cigarette right in our room, there was no vanity in the bathroom (only a freestanding sink, toilet and shower/tub), there was no internet access, the decor was depressing, and the street car ran all night long and was extremely loud, as it was right outside our window.  At check-out time, the hotel clerk came around like a drill sergeant evicting everyone and opening all the doors to every room after a guest left so he could keep track of who had vacated.  The premises was run by a man of East Indian descent who had no clue how to treat guests like valued customers.

Positives-Tram really convenient. Stops outside the motel front door and gets you downtown in 30minutes.- Ocean beach area is pleasant with Surfside cafe, interesting residential houses to check out, beach very near by. - Owner of the motel was helpful and polite at all times. He was willing to get out of bed to sort out a problem we had with our room. Owner offered to move us to room that was not directly above the pub which is situated under a part of this motel. We were not disturbed by any noise. -Furniture in room could be considered retro. It is not entirely without charm (pink tiled bath suite and wooden sideboard have retro appeal). Unfortunately this furniture is not cared for, polished or made into a feature. -Good amount of parking spaces.-Seemed a relatively safe area to stay. Interesting contrast to downtown. - Hot water and shower fine. Bathroom was acceptable in terms of cleanliness (contrast to dusty and shabby bedroom). Negatives- Bed bugs. We have stayed in lots of economy accommodation worldwide but have never been bitten by bed bugs so much before. My partner was bitten all over his face and we both received tell-tale lines of bites on our arms. The added problem of this was that we have now had to scrupulously launder all our clothes and suitcases back home, fearful the bed bugs might have hitched a ride with us. The bed was very old and rickety. - The 'heater' smelled of gas and consisted of an orange gas flame behind a grill. We asked for this to be switched off fearful of carbon monoxide poisoning.- The toilet blocked one morning and because we had been asking the owner for help to switch off the gas heater at 12pm the night before we decided to wait until we returned from our daytrip to ask for assistance with the toilet. Hotel staff discovered the blocked toilet over the course of the day and fixed it for us without us needing to request assistance but at the same time took away all our towels and did not replace. Since we were leaving the next morning and had been back and forth to the office for help we decided to use our beach towels the last evening. - Very dark room with no natural light. - Carpet very old, worn and dirty (could harbour more bed bugs). Floorboards underneath unsteady and rickety. This place could be worth the $90 a night we paid if the bed and carpet is replaced and bed bugs eradictated. A deep clean of the room we stayed in was also well over due. Be totally clear in your mind what you are paying for if you choose to stay here, for us the hassle of making sure we don't transport any bed bugs to our home. I don't know anything about fires but the gas heater looked lethal to me, opt for it to be switched off to be safe. The owner does not try and pretend that he is offering anything more than he has in his motel, he let us look at the room first but I would never stay here again after our last two days.

Service was painfully slow and completely disjointed (e.g. 'sorry, I poured your drink, but then sat it down so I could go and deal with the burgers on the barbecue'.  What barbecue?  There were only 4 tables occupied).  At times we were heavily patronised about how we asked for our steak to be cooked, and the fact that 'the food is cooked fresh, so you must wait'.

The service was seriously lacking at the front desk, some guests waited there for 1/2 hour (I'm not kidding) to check in. We booked the inn in January...they had 8 months notice of our wedding and we were thoroughly disgusted by the lack of service.  They could have been prepared, they had the advance notice. I did suspect this was going to happen about a month in advance of the wedding because the owner never returned my e-mails clarifying details of the day.  He also mocked me (the bride) to my face when I made a simple request to not grate the vegetables because I didn't want them to be mush.  What little staff they do have (outside of themselves and their daughter) is very unhappy and expressed to me that they would be quitting ASAP because they can't take it anymore.  The cheap porcelain dolls and over the top decor also really take away from what used to be (from what I hear) a gorgeous inn.

603099671,"I'll start with the good points of which there weren't many.  It was a very convenient location being that it is a 2 minute walk to downtown Sackville.  We lucked out and Sappyfest was going on when we were there so sitting at a table on the patio was very nice and we only had to walk a couple of minutes to get back to the Inn.  So comes the bad.. we arrived for check in at almost 5pm, check in starts at 3pm.  We had to ring the bell at the front desk 3 times and waited approx 15 mins to find someone to check us in.  We got the room key, went to our room and within about 5 mins had a knock at the door, the cleaning lady letting us know she wasn't done cleaning the room and still needed to finish the bed and clean the washroom.  The room was small and missing pieces of flooring, clock that didn't work, and not nearly what I was expecting from the pics I saw.  We were in the carriage house not the main Inn so maybe the rooms in the main Inn are better.  When leaving this morning to check out at 9:30am again I rang the bell and waited.. and waited.. rang the bell again, waiting again.  Finally hit the bell as hard as humanly possible and a few minutes later the man appeared so I could finally pay him and leave.  He was not friendly at check in or check out.  Their customer service needs a LOT of work.  The gardens that they boast about are not well taken care of and are just the typical plants you see growing on the side of the road on their own.  This place has such potential but it isn't kept up the way it needs to be or run the way it needs to be.  I was very sadly disappointed.",-1,1,0.580555556

AV-TGsFqRxPSIh2RmVF-,"Bad: We had booked 2 rooms for our 3 night Boston trip - King Room for us and a Double Double (ie with 2 double beds) for our teenagers. I booked this in December for our July visit. I emailed twice before arrival to request that the rooms were close by (on the same floor) and both times got no reply - and that should have alerted me and to be honest sums up 'Boxer Customer Service'. On arrival we were told that there were no rooms available with 2 beds, the guy on reception seemed clueless how to help us. Our teenagers were supposedly 'upgraded' to a suite where my son had to sleep on a sofa / pull out bed (or share a King size bed with his sister). Totally unacceptable - I booked these rooms 6 months in advance. All in all we had interactions with 4 different staff members (including someone from Accounts who had to process a compensation refund) and at no time did either my wife nor I feel like the Customer . . . . you know the kind The PAYING Customer! So in terms of Comfort score - low because my son was on a sofa bed for 3 nights. In terms of Value for Money - low 1800 and my 16 year old son gets a sofa bed In terms of Staff score - low because they are in serious need of some Customer Service training. Good: The Boxer in Boston SHOULD be a fantastic hotel - it's a great building, location is excellent (we were able to explore everything that Boston has to offer from there), rooms are a good size but overall our stay was not as good as it should have been.

Out of hotel stays in 29 countries, hotel W made the top of the list in poor customer relations, poor cleanliness, and horrible problem resolution. First they gave me an occupied room, then they down graded me to a lower grade room over night. The next day they didn't even clean our room when we returned, and they gave away the original room they were hold for me. The suites bathroom smelled like urine so bad and when we complained, it still was not cleaned by that evening. I had to fight with the hotel to apply a discount rate they never even offered. They have a slogan what ever when ever I can't say they once lived by that motto. This is not my first time at the W hotel organization but it certainly will be my last!

AV-TGuWBa4HuVbedGcJK,"On my most recent work trip to NYC, I chose to stay at the St Regis vs my usual (The Peninsula). Never again will I go back. After a long day of client meetings, I decided to grab a light dinner and drink at the hotel lobby bar (King Cole Bar). I travel quite a bit for work and my one rule of thumb is to avoid being holed up in a room with room service. I headed straight to the bar after getting back to the hotel and intentionally grabbed a small table in the far corner as I knew I'd need to get some work in to clear all my emails from the day. Literally within 15 seconds of powering on my laptop, one of the servers bolted over to me and asked if I was aware that they had a No Laptop Policy after 4pm. Seriously I had to ask myself, was I really staying at a 5-star business property I politely pushed back and said I was a guest at the hotel and had to get some work done and would be out of there quickly after my meal. He looked annoyed but then retreated.Fast forward 15-20 minutes...my food and wine arrives and I'm not even halfway through. That's when the FB manager then approaches me. He actually had the audacity to ask how much longer will I be on my laptop as I am being disruptive. Again, to set the context, I am sitting in the far corner next to a pillar and had my laptop screen dimmed to the lowest setting. I am not engaging with anyone yet I'm being disruptive One would think an FB manager would have some business and common sense and decency to recognize that you don't go and ask a paying guest at the hotel to get up in the middle of a meal because they are working on their laptop. When I told him I didn't understand their policy and why he was enforcing it, he said I was not fitting in to the bar scene. Unbelievable. He then tells me he'd be happy to have my food and wine moved outside the bar where I could freely work. I am at this point just dumbfounded. It was like being asked to move to the back of the bus or get off the bus for that matter. Most humiliating and distasteful experience ever and never ever would I have imagined it would be on a work trip at what's supposed to be an upstanding hotel. And just to be clear, on the many occasions I've had to power up my laptop at the bar at The Peninsula to get some work done, not once did anyone ask me to turn off my laptop or leave. Crystal clear for me now...Dear sfellelle, On behalf of the Management team at The St. Regis New York, we would like to thank you for your visit. We appreciate you taking the time to detail your recent stay at our property.Our hotel prides itself on providing five star service, yet in some cases, mistakes can occur. We apologize for the experience that you encountered in our Food and Beverage department, and please know that this is certainly not our standard. Rest assured, we took the necessary measures to do an internal follow up with our staff to ensure that all our guests have a flawless experience in our bar in the future in similar circumstances.We most certainly hope you will give us another opportunity to service you again in the future. Please don't hesitate to contact me directly to book your next visit or to discuss in length your experience at: Octavia.margineanstregis.com.

AV-TGuWBa4HuVbedGcJK,"Stayed 1 night as an SPG Gold member through the Amex Platinum Fine Hotels Resorts program. The hard product at the property is good but let down by extraordinarily bad service - hands down the worst received at any 5* luxury hotel.- On reserving, the hotel insisted that as a couple with a young child, we must book a rollaway bed at an extra charge and we could not share one king bed for health and safety reasons. Accepting the higher rate charge, on arrival, there was no rollaway provided. Luckily we didn't want one but they were extremely insistent on this fact when booking.- No welcome amenity offered as SPG Gold member.- Check-in experience went from cold and marginally polite to confrontational. Hotel would not honor the contractual one-category if available upgrade of the Amex FHR program. The hotel's own website defines these room categories for sale: superior, deluxe, grand luxe rooms, then 1 bedroom suites. Within the 1 bedroom suite category, the room types are Astor, Deluxe, Madison. Having booked a grand luxe room, at checkin their website showed availability for Deluxe and Madison suites. The agent insisted their obligation was only a one-room type upgrade, and not a category upgrade (which means any room type in that category). Therefore as no Astor suite was available, no upgrade for us.- I spoke to the Front Desk Manager, Susan, who insisted their interpretation of the FHR contract was correct. Having now spent 20 mins waiting for them to check round the back as they put it, with nowhere offered for my family to sit, I just wanted to get to a room. I then called Amex, who contacted the hotel. Unfortunately by this point Susan had allocated the available Deluxe suites to other guests or at least blocked them, and lied to my Amex agent claiming that I had been seeking an upgrade to a Madison suite worth 1000 extra, and the contract prohibits a triple room type upgrade. I don't appreciate the hotel manipulating their inventory, nor lying to my Amex agent when my request was for a Deluxe suite allowable by the FHR contract and worth only approx 200-300 more. Amex advise the hotel clearly has different definitions of available and category and these do not equate to available for sale on their website and category of room as listed on their website - sounds like they are happy to use different definitions to deny loyalty benefits.- On being shown to our room, the agent advised a butler would introduce himself in a couple of minutes. One hour later, no butler. I page the butler and receive a call back, requesting a champagne ice bucket and child amenities (these weren't provided even though child was listed on the reservation). Another hour later, still no sign of anything. Page the butler again, received the amenities... never received the requested ice bucket. Last we ever saw of the butler. No offer of many of the complimentary services as advertised on their website, but nice of them to provide tea cookies/milk.- Ordered room service dinner (with the still missing ice bucket) - quality was very average for the price and beware families, this hotel charges an 8 per PERSON room service charge which I have never encountered at any other hotel. So a family of 3 would pay a whopping 24 in addition to mandatory 20 gratuity and sales tax. The waiter advised us just to lie and say we are just one person next time! Called for the trays/trolley to be collected, 90mins later nobody had come and it was collected by housekeeping at turndown.- Tried to organise family activities through the concierge as advertised on their website, they acknowledged our request but never heard back from them after that. - Advertised functionality to stream your iPad media to the hotel TV does not work.- Included complimentary breakfast worth 41 is the most basic continental breakfast ever seen, consisting solely of 4 pastries, coffee and one orange juice. - On checkout, the agent's only words from walking to the desk were Mr , here is your bill, let me correct this error, hope to see you again. No how was your stay or anything similar.When paying four figures to stay in a hotel room, this doesn't meet any expectations and this stay was our first and last at a St Regis.Dear msnz,Please allow us to thank you for posting your review on Trip Advisor. We understand that our Director of Rooms has connected with you privately and we hope you are satisfied with the resolution. We hope to be at your service again soon and, until then, please contact our executive office for any additional assistance you may need.Kind Regards,Hermann ElgerGeneral Manager",-1,2,0.510446128

AV-TGwK3IxWefVJwr5IJ,"Bad: What I didnt like is the service of the staff. I reserved and paid last October a city view room, check in online on our way to the hotel and was assured key is waiting. But when we got there, no room available for city view. We were settled for a night in 3rd floor and we were assured the next 5nights we will be in the 6th floor. But the following day, they gave us a floor higher only, 4th floor. We cant see much of the city from 4th floor. All we can see is adjacent buildings. We were frustrated that there is no cafeteria for breakfast. Yeah, breakfast is included on the price but no chair to sit on, no table use. It is a grab and go breakfast. Very incovenient because breakfast is served in 5th and 6th floors's console table only. No microwave, no toaster. How can you eat the bagels they served in very cold temperature Secondly, we were not given instructions / info on our check in at the hotel what are the facilities they have for us. We only discovered while we were staying at the hotel. Like business center, fitness center,etc. The housekeeping, bad service! They forgot to replace the complimentary k-cup coffee. One day, they left a used pair of socks in our room. A pair of black socks rolled,dirty for a man whose size could be for a 6 footer and taller. My boys are only 5'3. Next day, they left again a wet soiled pink shirt on the table where the TV is. Why is that Everyday I always left as tip and a way of thank you for cleaning the room but all they leave is mess.

AV-TGwK3IxWefVJwr5IJ,"Bad: Overall I was very disappointed. I rarely write reviews, but I think everyone should keep in mind the following aspects of their trip and take the following all with a grain of salt. For the cost: Paid over 450/night for lowest price 1person room - highly overpriced, and overrated reviews I have to say. I was attending last minute trip for work, but wish I had chosen the Monaco, Drake, Intercontinental...Hyatt, Sheraton...anywhere else. For someone traveling on business, I would equate it to maybe a Hilton Doubletree, for four times the cost. Freebies: I didn't have the time given my work commitments to attend the free breakfast/snacks in evening, as I had to be out at other events, which already provided this. I didn't need the free internet as I had my own. Room Itself: This was probably the worst aspect, yet the most important, and what prompted my very negative rating. I overlooked a rusty building roof - wish I had taken a picture as I don't need gorgeous, but this was anything but. It really looked like if I opened the window I would get some form of lung disease. I would have closed the blinds...but they were blackout blinds...which you don't want if waking up at 5-6 for work events. The room was lackluster, and though there are only 6 floors, there are 2 VERY slow elevators, one of which was not working for a good portion of my stay, so don't try to get anywhere on time, or plan to be late and blame it on the elevators with a legit excuse. Overall: I expected more when I saw the cost, positive ratings, the reviews for boutique - this was anything but. Disappointing stay, especially when my work conference overlapped with my birthday. Will not be returning. Good: On the plus side, the people at the front desk were fine - the doormen were fine and one woman at front when you walk in was extremely nice and I have to give her probably the most positive review for being most pleasant. Other desk guy was fine but clearly apathetic and not going out of his way to be friendly. Appreciated ability to store luggage in between end of stay and flight departure...but again, not something that makes hotel stand out.",-1,6,0.544866103

AWUPNmq6IxWefVJw3c71,"Stayed a few days while on business, big mistake. I don't want an experience from my Hotel - I want value for my money. No Closet, No dressers, No coffee maker, No Frig, No Microwave, No Bathtub, No Iron, No ice machines, No room service, No Workspace and of course no free breakfast. They give you a poker chip for one free coffee or drink. It is geared towards those who don't need any of these amenities and want to hang out in a noisy bar environment for your computer work. They give you a small tray table about 15x15 inches to work on in your room, that doesn't cut it for me. I get the revenue play with putting more rooms in a much small piece of real estate but for the nightly cost, a business traveler can find much nicer hotels in Chicago. I would suggest an improvement would be to have a fold up table on the wall and a chair at least. Traveler beware if your are on business (especially a women) this is most likely not the place for you - unless you just want tacos and the free lollypop from room service.

The oddest part was there were no teaspoons, only stirrers and amazingly no kettle- and only two mugs for four people. We had to bother house keeping just to bring a kettle up to make tea (also not supplied). This hotel sells trendy box water for 8 which pretty much sums up how far off the mark this place is with practicalities. Trendy sure, but practical and sensible...no. Reminded me of of a start up thats well funded but just silly. Also the rooms air conditioning setting included jet engine or off so that was extremely uncomfortable. I wouldnt stay here again given they also have an odd naughty drawer and I needed to explain to my 7 year old what sex dust was. Extremely odd place to stay as a family.

Shower was not clean at all and light above it was out. Had to ask three times for it to be changed. Grout had gone silver and the actual tiles hadn't been properly cleaned in ages, you could tell by marks that appeared when it steamed up. Toilet was all yellowed around the seat rim. Splashes on wallpaper down back of toilet and across from toilet too. Toiletries provided in large bottles where the tops of the pumps had ingrained dirt. Horrible. Floor in room was covered in marks and the windows were filthy. It all smelt a bit stale too. Lighting is low I think to hide what's actually not very clean. Drawers were full of little bits of white dust and paper, clearly never been checked or cleaned. Ironing board was so bad you had to put two towels on it to avoids marks on clothing. We got an ok deal through booking.com but had we paid full rate I would've been really unhappy. Location just wasn't for us, right by Union square, we would've preferred somewhere more local but other people may like that.

AVzOLf4aFcQ3k02bBrRN,"I wish tripadvisor had 1/2 stars for our use because I would have given this a 2 1/2...3 is too high. This was our first hotel of 8 different ones on our Napa/Pacific Coast vacation, so I have a lot to compare it to. I have many other reviews on this site and I try to be fair when reviewing any property we've sayed at.Having said that.....It was my first experience at a Best Western brand and if this is a plus property I would not want to stay at a non-plus one.I disagree with the person responding to all of the other reviews...this is not a good value or comparable value to other hotels in the area. Who are you comparing yourself with When comparing properties you need to look at the amenities of hotels in your price range. You are priced as high as other properties but those properties have better/more amenities or are closer to vineyards, therefore it's not a fair comparison. It's like comparing apples and oranges...both fruits but there are many different qualities. Now back to the property....Don't expect to see any vines even though the word is in the name. This is located on a very busy road surrounded by stores and restaurants. If that's what you're looking for, great book it, just be aware that there will be a lot of traffic noise and light polution.Cons....The pool's capacity is 8 people. That should tell you something about the size. I'd guess it's 8X10' (that's probably a generous estimate). In my opinion putting in a couple of extra hottubs instead of the tiny pool would have been more beneficial. The balcony we had was so closed in and dark. The solid front and sides don't allow you to see anything when sitting in the chairs, not that the view was great....we looked out over Denny's roof and a traffic light. Oh, Dennys. sigh.....went our first 2 mornings. Ordered the free entree of 2 eggs, 2 pancakes and 2 bacon or sausage. Getting a hot entree I guess is impossible, the food was cold to the touch. My husband faced the kitchen and saw the breakfasts sitting up on the counter for a long period of time before the waitress bothered to serve it. There were maybe 4 other parties in the restaurant at the time, not busy at all. The tea water was luke warm at best. Total waste of my time.Location...not your romantic getaway place by any means. About 20 to 25 minutes to the heart of Napa's wine country depending on traffic. In hinesight I would not have booked this hotel if not for the MANY( now suspicious in my mind)...reviews. I find it hard to believe that this many people think this hotel is the best. Really After spending 3 days in Napa and seeing many other hotels closer to the wineries, I question the validity of these raving reviews.Pros....Yes there are a few...I promised a fair review and that's what I deliver.Shower....best shower head of any hotel. In fact I'm looking for one for my own shower.Cleanliness....our room was very clean. Small in size in comparison to other hotels on our trip and just an armoire instead of a closet. Microwave, fridge and coffee pot was a nice convenience.Bed/pillows....very comfortable.So if you're looking for a clean place to sleep that's a bit overpriced than book this hotel. If you want to see vineyards from your balcony and sit by a nice pool...don't book this property. At most I would expect to pay under 100 a night for this property based on it's location and lack of amenities. All the renovations in the world don't matter to me if they're not available when I'm there. They need to charge accordingly.We paid 537 for Saturday, Sunday and Monday evenings. I now know we could have spent the same money and stayed at a better property. Oh well, live and learn.Thank you for your detailed review. First, we do compare our hotel to our competition by actually going to all the hotels in our class and looking at their rooms and overall condition of their property. Each hotel will have their pluses and minuses. We also shop prices on a daily basis and we make sure we are competitive in our market. We actually have all the prices of the hotels on the days you stayed and only one hotel was less than our price and its located 9 miles south of Napa, further away from the vineyards. On average you would have paid between 75 -200 more for your stay in a comparable hotel.All Best Westerns that have at least a 3 diamond recognition from AAA have the opportunity to be a PLUS property as long as they have a PIP( property Improvement Plan) in place. With the cost that runs in the hundreds of thousands of dollars it will take time for each property to complete. There is a time frame on completing this and we are well ahead of the deadlines. Our rates are similar to last years (before Plus) and we have added breakfast at Dennys and many more amenities. We never hide the fact that we have a small pool (12x 184). There are pool area pictures displayed on our website and other 3rd party sites. When a guest inquires about the pool we let them know that we have a small pool. We recommend other hotels if a guest are looking for a larger pool.As for reviews, all reviews are honest and we know that there will be a difference of opinions and as you can see we are rated in the middle of the hotels in Napa. We are a family run hotel and take pride in our hotel and are always looking at ways to improve. TripAdvisor is way too smart to let suspicious reviews slip through as it is their reputation and ours.Thank you for your compliments on the cleanliness of our rooms, (we are an ultra clean property) our shower heads and beds.

At check in, we were helped by Jermal and it was the worst check in experience I've ever had (even at Motel 6 they at least make eye contact with you and answer your questions). Very cold and not friendly staff with the exception of the valet guys. They were very nice and professional. Once we got to our room, it was clean and spacious. I did not find anything wrong with it except the infamous bad water pressure in the shower and the fact that we only had 2 big towels (All hotels I've stayed at have had 4 big towels) We signed up for the SPG Green Choice at check in so the extra towels would had been nice and we actually never received the 5 vouchers for making the green choice. Aloft has a lot of potential because of their location. I am giving them another chance in late May, hopefully this time they listen to our requests and are more customer oriented.Thank you for staying with us this past week.

The pillows were really uncomfortable, both of the taps were hot, the AC was so loud and made a buzzing noise (we asked twice to have this fixed and nothing changed), the fire alarm went off at 3am and there was never really an excuse given as to what was going on, then (because we'd had no sleep) we put the 'do not disturb' sign on and the cleaner banged on our door repeatedly shouting 'housekeeping' until we answered. The water was shut off one evening from 11pm-3am which meant that when we had to go to the toilet it sat there for hours. No one informed us where a smoking area was so we assumed there was not one... this meant that we smoked out the front and got disturbed, bugged and pushed by homeless people asking for money, cigerettes, etc. It really was just one thing after the other.

AV6ZfnuiRxPSIh2RlHtM,"We travel to Six Flags over GA pretty frequently. This was our first and last time for staying at this hotel. I'm generally a 4-5 star reviewer of hotels, with the occasional 3 star, here and on Trip Advisor, but this was my worst experience. There are plenty of problems with this place, but I'll start with the pros:Pro: Location to 6 Flags and room comfort. Both of these and parking were fine.Cons: It is not an overstatement to say this was the worst check in experience I've ever had, and not one interaction with staff the rest of the stay would change that. From walking into the hotel to check-in to finally walking into my room was probably 45-60 minutes, and when you are traveling with family, it's late at night, and you have to get up early, that's 45 minutes you can use. I walked in to the hotel, and I was probably 3rd or 4th to check in, and the line never moved as it took them forever to resolve what appeared to be simple problems. I don't know what the other customer issues were, but they weren't the problems. By the time I got there, I could see why it took a long time. A routine check in with reservations took longer here then anywhere else. When I did finally get my room keys, I go up to room with family who have been waiting WAY TOO LONG, and the keys don't work (and yes, I've stayed in enough hotels to know how to use hotel key cards). So after trying for several minutes, I go back down to front desk, wait in line for about 5 more minutes for the two workers to take care of routine check ins, and have the worker re key the cards again (and this time I watched to make sure he did them, and they did work when I returned to room).In my room, I check the safe, and on the safe it has the note about if you don't want to be billed for not using the safe, tell front desk on check out. So the next morning, I tell front desk we didn't use the safe, and yet, he still put it on my bill and would not remove.And this is why I think it is a Quality Brand issue. They aren't checking on their hotels at all. This comment has been made repeatedly on this website and the Choice Hotels website, but it is a problem.On the 3rd floor, the elevator has only 1 button, since you can only go down, but the arrow points up (little thing that make no difference on my stay, but demonstrate lack of care). The privacy door latch was put up backwards, so that it couldn't do anything to keep someone from opening the door. These lack of attention to details isn't a big thing by themselves, but the accumulation of them is a general sloppiness in maintenance that is apparent.Dear Guest. I would like to personally apologize for the series of unfortunate incidences that you experienced during your stay with us.

A booking was made by telephone for a 2 bed suite for New years Eve. We arrived ready to check in. Unfortunately the desk clerk was totally unhelpful. Our reservation was non existant. The clerk did not give a damn. We had travelled only a relatively short time (150 miles), but now were without accomodation on New Year. The clerk would not even help with finding an alternative. The reservation had been checked TWICE before arriving, The first time was 2 days prior, and then the night before arriving. The number we were given WAS confirmed both times on the phone, so we travelled to Anaheim without any worries. HOW WRONG WE WERE! The Reservation number that was confirmed twice has now upon arrival turned into a non existant number. There was no record of the whole transaction. After trying unsucsessfully to get any help whatsoever from the staff, we decided to give up and find an alternative. As can be expected the area was booked up, except for one place - a real roach motel. We chose to stay there (another bad choice) and had the worse night sleep ever . Thanks to Marriot the 2009 celebrations were ruined! What more can I say except - CHECK CHECK and double check, even after you receive a conformation number.

They changed the name on the reservation, they changed it from a one bed to a studio and raised the rate from 109 to 129 We booked in Oct but 1st of Nov they put up a disclaimer that the hotel is under remodel...but the disclaimer was not on the webpage when we booked. Remodel is an understatement its a train wreck. There was 4 or 6 couches piled up in front of a cargo bin just sitting there with some other ragged furniture and lamps in part of the parking lot.Our 1st room was nice but getting to the room was a mess, floorboards missing, walls messed up, the door wide open to the electronics closet which cant be seen by the front desk so anyone could walk in and create havoc. I am sure there is credit card info in those backup etc.It was late about 10:30 and we rented a PPV and then we hear something in the kitchen area and its a rat that runs behind the stove and now is stuck and screaming. So we go down to the front desk and then send a guy up to try and catch the rat. He cant catch it so they tell us we need to move to the other building.We do and its a bigger mess then the 1st building. There is black goop all over the floor in leading to the elevator and then in the elevator too, the 2nd building is old,smells and needs remodel bad. The new room is 2 bedroom but its hit and miss, way to much furniture, kitchen is dated, microwave falling down, dusty and dirty and about a 3 gap under the front door so someone could look in if they wanted.When we tell them the room will not work they offer to move us back to the 1st building but to the room a joining the room with the ratIt was just a trip hotel from hell which is really sad because its normally an ok hotel. We book next time at Hilton.Was really disappointed that management didn't reach out to us in till we contacted them.John Dominguez Assistant GM useless!Thank you for rating us on trip advisor as we are always looking to improve our hotel and do well by all of our guests. As most business professionals I was not available during the weekend while you were here at the property: however, we always have a manager on duty.As we are currently undergoing renovations, we have the challenge of insuring that our hotel continues to operate with minimal disruption to our guests. We understand that finding a mouse in your room can be an unnerving situation and tried to put you at ease for the duration of your stay. My staff did need to relocate you to another room so that we could have an external company resolve the issue which has now been rectified and make sure that you had a comfortable and pest free stay.Im happy to see that my staff offered you an upgraded newly renovated accessibility suite that did not have any adjoining wall or door to the previous room. We are sorry that you declined it. My understanding is the manager also offered to purchase a shower chair as the remaining 16 accessible rooms were fully committed. The Suite that you were relocated to was an upgraded suite as an additional apology for the issue that occurred. In my email to you on Monday after you had departed I explained that the renovation construction team working in the building you had relocated to did in fact make scuff marks on the floor from the tires of the dolly's that they were using to move the larger furniture out of the rooms to make way for the new furniture that we were receiving. As we placed you in an un-renovated suite for the final part of your stay, I can understand why you would feel it was out dated as the renovation is to give us a more modern and updated look and this suite had not been completed as of yet. As per Marriott standard the renovation information was available to all guests as of the beginning of October prior to when your reservation was made. Jeanette the Manager on duty removed your charges for the first night due to the mouse incident, while isolated, is unacceptable. We sincerely apologize as no guest should ever experience that. As you have stated, you have stayed with us numerous times and have never had any issues.The room you noticed with the door opened was awaiting a new air conditioning unit, there is nothing in this room that would present a security issue for our guests. We will also be purchasing some extra assistance chairs to accommodate past our eighteen accessibility rooms. again our apologies that your stay was less than perfect.

AVwdIPxpkufWRAb52lqx,"I am a gold elite member with the Marriott brand. We stayed here earlier this month. I didn't have time to get around to making a complaint because we were getting things done for my mother in law's funeral. First off the first room we were given smelled like mildew. It was disgusting. So I went to the front desk and was given a second room next door to this room. It did not smell any better. So I was given a third room this time in the main building. So we move our things to this room. I brush my teeth and get into bed it was then 1:00am approximately. I lay on the right side of the bed and the bed breaks!! I am about 180 pounds why is the bed breaking I fall out of the bed and hit my head on the corner of the night stand. At this point I am beyond furious. I calmly walk back to the lobby and explain to the gentleman. He apologizes and I am given a fourth room. The next morning I go to down to talk to the manager but the manager is in a meeting and the lady at the front desk rudely tells me the guy from night shift comped my room what else do I want. I could've of choked the ignorant lady. So I checkout and move to a different hotel. A manager named Patrick calls and leaves a voicemail the next afternoon. I called Patrick back multiple times and left voicemails. Never received a phone call at all or email nothing. We have stayed at this hotel for almost 5 years in a row. It's the only hotel we stay at in Anaheim. This is beyond ridiculous. Category 6 this place should be more of an 2 or 3. I have stayed at nicer category 3,4,5 hotels.

AVwdIPxpkufWRAb52lqx,Overall we are Marriott Gold Elite members and have the Marriott credit card so we really do Marriott all the time but this is one of the locations that has very poor upkeep. Our room had a funny mold smell and the sink and shower did not drain properly there was the toilet paper roll that was broken a picture frame was not mounted correctly and fell to the floor. The microwave was mounted not at a level. And the list goes on...Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts regarding this issue. We appreciate you bringing it to our attention. We will share your message appropriately within the organization. Edgar RiveraGeneral Manager,-1,0,0.3725

Reservations did not confirm booking with Hotels.com so I had to wait at the front desk for 45 minutes while they sorted that out--the staff who helped me were very apologetic and helpful, however. The room and the annex in general is one of the worst places I've ever stayed. From the stench of the hallway to the dilapidated condition of the room, the free WiFi with no connection, and the balcony with its rickety railing and beautiful view of the parking garage and liquor store next door, permeated by the sounds of drunken kids in the hallways all night long and the cacophony of constant EMS and police sirens that never seemed to stop. If you're over 30, you DO NOT want to stay here. EVER.

The walls are paper thin- I could hear a casual conversation in the room adjacent to ours. Even the elevator had 3 holes in its walls!

AVwc5_ErByjofQCxjeZE,"NOT shabby chic, just shabby. We had stayed at the Chelsea in the past and expected the Annex to be at least similar. But it was more like a downgraded, poorly maintained motel 6 trading on the good name of the Chelsea. Check in took 25 minutes waiting in line. The first room had high basement type windows (that were broken and didn't lock) looking over the roof where the air handlers were. The second room had a broken lock on the patio door. The patio was flooded, the dresser was chipped, stained, and drawers wouldn't stay closed, the bathroom door was water damaged at the bottom and stained, the bathroom floor was stained and dirty. Both rooms we saw were shabby and desperately in need of upgrades. The elevator floor was damaged and missing tiles, the restaurant downstairs (which was cute and hip in the past) is now old and shabby also. Not worth the money. As it is now, I would not recommend this hotel at all.",-1,0,0.416166667
AVwc5_ErByjofQCxjeZE,"Our stay was mediocre at best! There is CHELSEA and Chelsea ANNEX. We had the ANNEX, and it was in poor condition. Furniture was far from nice, front desk and lobby gave you a very good first impression. The people at the desk were nice. One block from the beach, which was huge for me. Paid parking at 10 a day in a lot about 1.5 blocks away, or, 15 a day got valet. The elevator was very rough to ride. There was a small, but nice, pool. No coffee maker, no microwave, no mini-frig, ices machine did not work very well. Out air conditioning was set at 50* and it was so hot in there, especially for sleeping. The maintenance man said it couldn't get any cooler because it ran on cold water, and the water wasn't cold!

AVwc5_ErByjofQCxjeZE,The Chelsea itself seemed very nice even thought I didn't stay in a room there. As you walk through the Chelsea and into the Annex you get a totally different feel. It goes from semi-upscale to the creepy part of the hotel in American Horror Story. The beat up squeaky elevators to dimly lit hallways and the sketchy bright red lights on every floor it screamed AHS. On the positive side the price was great for a Friday night and it was just a really short walk to the Trop.

AWE8LfTC3-Khe5l_gKeD,"Very old hotel that caters to low class clientele. Being near Disneyland, this hotel is a fly trap to families who cannot afford something nicer. There were children running around all hours of the night and day and the hotel staff did nothing to keep them quiet. Our first night there we had a family above us with small children who kept running around the room and because of the noise we assume they were jumping off the furniture. We complained to the hotel staff and nothing was done to stop this. It continued until well after 11 PM and night.The second night we were there, we had a family with small children next door to us and it was apparent from what we saw, they were there with other families who also had small children. They were kept there doors open and the children were running up and down the balcony with no supervision. At 6 AM the next morning, someone was pounding on the door next to us very loudly and yelling fire, fire, fire. It woke up the people next to us so they opened there door and began to play loud rap music until about approximately 9 AM when we left. We were on the second floor near the office and all of this activity was extremely loud and had to have been heard at the office, but no action was taken to stop it.I would never stay at this hotel again!!!!Thank you for taking the time to write us a review.

There was no offer to keep the reservations at the standard rate the reservations had simply been cancelled and the rooms were no longer available. When asked why he would do this on the day we were due to check in, the manager basically told us he did it because he could.We understand that hotel policies may limit the availability of discounted rooms, but we should have been notified earlier so we could make other arrangements.

AVwdDOFxByjofQCxk_JC,"Unacceptable, unprofessional behavior.1. Couldn't get into room because I wasn't on the reservation. 2. Person let into room who wasn't on the reservation.3. Unreliable housekeeping.4. Double-charged for entire stay... WHEN I WASN'T EVEN ON THE RESERVATION.So, to begin... My friend PREPAID with her card for a room for us to share, but requested that my name be added to the reservation since I would arrive in NOLA hours before her. There's a whole email trail to prove they agreed, had my name spelled correctly, etc. I arrived, and they're like who are you I'm tired. I've been traveling. I need to shower, but no. I can't get into the room until hours later when my friend lands and gets it sorted from her Uber. I check us in using my card for incidentals, saying they'd only put a 50 hold on my card if we charged something to the room (we didn't). My friend arrives three hours later, but basically gets into our room about 15 minutes after I do. Once she's there, she tells me a pretty funny story. Her bf and his friends had another room, and even though he never put them on the reservation at all, they gave them keys! I had documentation and couldn't get into my room, and they, complete strangers for all the hotel knows, just waltzed into theirs! A huge security issue!The room itself was nice enough, and so was the pool however, the pool bar closed at random times despite having official posted hours. The bartenders were rude, as was most of the hotel staff (except for the doormen, who were delightful). Our room was only cleaned half the days of our stay. Housekeeping didn't replenish the toiletries when they did clean the room, and with two women, we obviously ran out of shampoo. When we called the front desk, around 10pm, they said they'd run out! At 11pm they came with a bag (and I mean garbage bag) full of.... lotion Because that helps. So both my friend and I showered without washing our hair, only to have housekeeping show up again at 2AM IN THE MORNING, banging on the door, with one bottle of shampoo that I guess they found. Not only was it late, but it was LATE.And now the worst part, to top it all off: Remember when I wasn't even on the reservation Yeah, they charged my credit card on file for a temporary hold FOR THE ENTIRE STAY. After my friend HAD ALREADY PREPAID. They got their before we even stepped in the door, and then double charged a completely different credit card with a completely different name. Yeah, no. You can deal with my credit card company thanks. I'm giving them two stars instead of one because the doormen were so incredibly nice. The nicest I've ever met. They should all get bonuses.And some additional minor points:Doormen: SO NICE! I LOVED THEM!Housekeeping: Good job cleaning WHEN they cleaned (but didn't restock soaps)Pool: Small but really nice, great viewBars: Rude, closed for no reasonFood: GreatBed: ComfortableBathroom: AwesomeNoise level: LOUD but it's not the soundproofing.

AVwcgshl_7pvs4fzv3ge,"The location of this place is prime. The hotel condition, on average is nice. I found my room fantastic, with a kitchenette and living room. The elevators were old and confusing (only one went to the garage, but you could not call just that one and there were no stairs).Breakfast was average-- the scrambled eggs were really dry and so were the waffles/french toast.Some of the staff were kind and helpful, but many didn't seem to care and others seemed new. Maybe this location had a high influx of new front desk members at the time of my stay. There are two kiosks at the front desk, and a phone between. While I was checking in, the other kiosk was also occupied by a staff member assisting a customer, and another staff member was using the phone between to talk loudly to a service member about a customer who had not had their room cleaned in three days. This was concerning, distracting, and off-putting. This also distracted the lady helping me check in from doing her job.One night, we were awoken by a very loud banging noise coming from the room next to us close to midnight. The banging, accompanied by yelling, continued for several minutes. Worried and scared, I called the front desk, but the person who answered didn't seem to care about the situation and at first didn't offer a solution until I asked if there was nothing they could do, and they said they would send somebody up there again. The front desk staff member said the lady had been locked out by her partner who had deadbolted the door. By this point, the lady had been standing outside her room yelling and banging on the door for half an hour (by her account-- overheard when she yelled at her partner when he finally opened the door). I'm worried that the staff allowed this to continue for so long. What if the partner had been suffering a medical emergency, or had never opened the door Nobody followed up with us regarding this issue, which was disappointing. Had someone touched base in the morning and apologized for the inconvenience, I likely wouldn't be writing this review.Upon checkout, the front desk staff threw away a handwritten not eaddressed to me as a guest of the company whose conference I was attending because my partner was performing the checkout. Overall, I was really let down by my stay here. The rooms are so nice and the location is great. I thought the Hyatt brand could be trusted with providing a great, seamless customer experience, but it didn't seem like they cared.Hello and thank you for taking the time to share your experiences at our hotel with us.

Their directions on the ways you have to use the room key in the elevator and room were not very clear. We heard that over and over again as we went up and down the elevator with other visitors. The room had strange windows that looked out to the hotel interior. We missed having a window to do a quick weather check. The bathroom was spacious but had the most non-ergonomic faucet. Turning it on meant bumping your hand on the lighted mirror above the sink and that was unpleasant. All the elevators stopped working at one point and the staff only offered a free bottle of water despite the significant challenge for the hotel visitors. I observed a person in a wheel chair as one example. No help was offered for getting yourself or luggage to and from the lobby (besides a free bottle of water from the lobby shop). Although sometimes things happen, it is how the staff responds and this was a major disappointment. The free shuttle will take you up to 1 mile away if it is available or you can wait.

AVz6h463LD2H7whiYPOd,"What a bad mistake choosing this hotel. As a Platinum Marriott member, I thought that I could expect a certain minimum standard in service and accommodation. Man, was I wrong! Although I booked the least expensive room type, I expected a room upgrade, if available. The Marriott website showed a number of upgraded room types available, but the hotel refused to upgrade. I have never seen this before. The manager lied to me, saying there were no other rooms available, and had no explanation when I pointed to the front desk clerk, who confirmed what the Marriott website said about other rooms available. The room I was provided was the smallest room I have ever experienced...my home closet is larger! Worse yet, the room did not feel clean. The bathroom floor was unacceptable. Thankfully, I was able to check out the next day and find a much better hotel at about a third less.

The positives: economical, close to Red Rock, large pool, lots of parking, large rooms, nice staff. Negatives: old, the carpets are shaggy like the atmosfere in general. In the end we wound up just sleeping and spending the afternoons on the Strip, which takes 30 minutes by car.Thank you for your review. Sounds like you enjoyed most of your stay, and you will be pleased we are going through a full scale remodel of our hotel rooms.

AWEw3i5yRxPSIh2RsYCd,"A nice clean casino with affordable restaurants. However, the service you get from the hosts and managers are nothing short of Unacceaptable. Being one of the newest casino in Summerlin area does not give management the right to have a chip on their shoulder. Unlike other casinos who treat their guest as if they would want to be treated, the Suncoast management don't care if one has a pulse as long as one bring in revenue to their casinos.Their compensation for players is Zero. You can be sitting there for 5 hours and end up with a 10 buffet voucher, which they will write it off on their expenses. I stop an executive host to ask a question about the table action and he purposely ignored me and walked away. I have been to this casino in the past and swear to my family and friends that I will never make the drive and step in this casino AGAIN. Suncoast management should understand that they are not the only casino in Vegas and they are not close to being the best. I would rate them bottom of the barrell.Suncoast management: Go back to the basics and treat customers well and they will come back for more action.",-1,1,0.397193878

AWEw3i5yRxPSIh2RsYCd,"Something is seriously wrong with the hotel in this casino! Customer service in the casino is outstanding in the hotel not so much. Left our room at 8am to go to the Grand Canyon for the day. Upon returning at 9pm that night found our hotel room door open with the lock holding the door open! Checked the room and it appeared everything was still intact. Talk to the night supervisor at the front desk about it. She told us there was nothing she could do about it and she would call security. Security met us at our room. Talked to us, checked the room and they decided it was no big deal as nothing was missing! So I guess they think it's ok for your room to be open when you are not there! And for at least 8 hrs too. They treated us like we were scamming them or something. Talked to casino night supervisor about it and finally got someone who actually cared. But could give us no answers until she talked to the casino manager.Casino manager finally called next day and said she would comp our room for one night. Well to make this long story short, night was not comped ended up paying for our full 4 nights! I asked to talk to the casino manger again but was told they would not be in until noon. I will never stay in this hotel again nor will I gamble here either. If you stay here lock all your valuables up in the safe. And be prepared for terrible customer service if anything does go wrong. Casino manager did call back later in the day and did comp two nights but I find the actions of the front desk supervisor as well as the security people unacceptable! Also every one acted like it was not a big deal. Maybe they should have someone leave their front doors open all day and see how they feel about that!Thank you for taking the time to post your comments. We apologize for any inconveniences you experienced during your stay. Please be assured that finding your room open is of great concern, and we have advised all appropriate departments of your specific situation. At no time did we think you were scamming or something of that nature. While we can understand your frustrations, please understand there are policies and procedures to be followed in a situation like this.

We lifted up the sheets and it was clean and mattress was clean, however in the box spring of the bed, there was a swarm of bed bugs that once we flashed the light on them they all dove into the box spring. We continued and the front desk and they upgraded our room, however due to our disgust we arranged a booking at the Hyatt Regency down the road which was beyond clean.

AVwd3-Mk_7pvs4fz-BmW,"I recently stayed at the Club Quarters while in Chicago for a family gathering. This hotel was a major disappointment for several reasons:1) They don't honor their commitments. I had reserved a room with a queen size bed through Expedia, but was given a room with two twin beds instead. The excuse: they ran out of bedspreads for queen size beds (how lame is that). 2) The elevator was unreliable. After checking in, myself and another guest were stuck on the first floor because of a malfunctioning card-reader in the elevator. The front desk staffperson fortunately was able to jiggle her card in a way that prompted the elevator to start moving. Not a good sign.3) The room reminded me of a depressing college dorm room. 4) The staff have no concept of customer service. On a prior visit, the staff were not willing to make any accomodations for a late checkout (even 15 minutes after the official checkout time - truly Kafkaesque). At checkout, no one has ever asked me whether I enjoyed my stay. Overall, the location is great, the rooms are clean and quiet, and all of the appliances work. But expect to be treated like a third-class citizen if you stay here.",-1,2,0.470614035

But more things wrong than I've ever encountered in 1 hotel room: 1. The a/c, even when set to 65, was warmish, and only blowed in the entryway, not in the bed area.2. The light next to the bed was linked to the entry light: if you wanted the bed light to work, you had to have that hall light on. If you turned that off, the bed light went off too.3. No ironing board!4. Nothing to put the soap on, just the bathroom counter. That's icky.5. The bedspread was cool looking, but not something I'd like to sit on or sleep under. But if I peeled that away there was just the sheet. 6. That entryway was dark, even with its one light turned on.7. The counter with the coffee machine was dark too, even with the light turned on.8.

I know that the check-in time is 3pm but no room was available and I had to wait till 3.15 !No luggage rack in this tiny room and I had to call three times before I got one (check the records of the Housekeepers phone)When I came back at 6 pm after having walked in the city, I wanted to take a shower. The water was cold (around 30 degrees Celsius ). The Housekeeper sent someone who was unable to fix that. So I went to the reception desk who gave me another room .The first room was on the 28th floor, the 2nd on the 4th so I had to repack and go from one room to the other 3 times THRU THE LOBBY, because the elevators are not the same . No one would ever propose to give me a hand !I gave two trousers to be washed and ironed. That was done at 8.30 and I was supposed to have them back by 6, that evening. Nothing. I had to claim them the following morning . That doesnt fit with what is written on the laundry service paper.This morning, I ordered black tea with milk in the Coffee Shop downstairs.

AVwelVZLIN2L1WUf6TpO,"1. I did not like the experience of dealing with the Expedia person who assisted with the reservation. 2. It was annoying to learn only while checking out that this is a time share hotel. No one told me. 3. The WIFI was slow, and unreliable, cutting out from time to time. Also, when it tried to upgrade to the offered higher speed WIFI, it was quite an ordeal that took about 90 minutes and a call to the help line at your WIFI vendor. BTW, you might try the user interface for that sign up - it exasperatingly erases all one's data entries if a single one of them is incorrect (eg if you generate an unacceptable password) 4. The Business Center has two PCs that are excruciatingly slow, and a printer as well that lumbers along. Old, slow, out of date. 5.

On the way to the room we were greeted by a lady attempting to sell the time shares. The lady was EXTREMELY rude, when we declined the information she made snippy comments like well don't you want to finish checking in. That was her sales tactic but standing there with room keys in my hand and not being born yesterday it was apparent she had nothing to do with us checking in. She also tried to bribe us with chocolate which was very juvenile. During check out and they told me I had a balance.

AVwdk4zOByjofQCxqeEN,"I booked my reservation on Motel 6's website. Upon arriving I requested to see my room before checking in. The hotel clerk refused my request and stated that it is the companys policy NOT to allow a person to see a room until after checking in first. (This should have been my first clue to leave.) The hotel clerk stated that after I have checked in that I could inspect the room. Furthermore, the hotel clerk stated that if the room was not satisfactory that I could leave without being charged. Both the room and the building were not satisfactory. It was 90 degrees in Atlanta on my visit and my room as well as the hallway in the building was hot and was not as comfortable as it should have been. The ice machine in the building hallway was in desperate need of repair because it was making an extremely loud humming sound that could be hear all the way down the corridor. The sheets on the bed needed to be changed. The hotel clerk refused to change the sheets and stated that if I wanted them changed that I had to remove the sheets myself. I have never heard of such nonsense. Lastly, the amount of money that the hotel wanted to charge me was 18.00 higher than the amount I was quoted when I made my reservation. Thus, with the bad conditions as well as the bad attitude of the staff, I left Motel 6 the SAME DAY and checked into the Marriott for just 7.00 more than what Motel 6 was charging per night. However, the Marriott gave me a free breakfast each morning compared to Motel 6 only serving coffee.The Motel 6 hotel clerk did not refund me the full amount of the charge to my credit card account. My credit card was charged for one night's stay. I wanted to get out of there so badly that I did not argue with the hotel clerk. I just disputed the charge with my credit card company and received an instant refund. So for the reasons cited above is why I would not recommend this hotel.",-1,0,0.52790404

The biscuits were rock hard. The scrambled eggs were a very bad version of imitation.

The reception clerk was nice, and checked us in quickly. That was the best thing about this experience. My wife and I walked into the room and we're immediately hit with a terrible smell, and before we could complain the phone rang in the room, which was the reception desk calling to tell us that she should not have put us in that room because of the smell, and to come to the desk for new keys to a different room, which we obliged. We got our new keys and went to the new room, which smelled better, but looked sketchy, so we pulled back the covers on the bed to see ants crawling around.

AWCACeD5IxWefVJwvFCE,"First of all, I read these reviews alot and I am always suprised at how picky some people are. We are not that way and are usually looking for something that is a good deal even if it's not the greatest hotel. Having said that, this is my review. Got into the hotel at 11:30 at night after 11 hours of driving to find that the air conditioning in our room did not work. The front desk clerk was extremely rude and very difficult to work with, however a security/maintence guy was more than helpful and after about 45 minutes we were transfered to a new room. The hotel is extremely basic if that is what you are looking for. It is in the middle of roads and highways and overpasses and really has no character at all. If you are looking for a one or two night stay at a cheap price it's not too bad. The hotel does have a decent free breakfast, but if it gets to busy, it is very chaotic, crowded and dirty. There are several other hotels nearby that I would try first if we ever came to DC again.",-1,1,0.476406926
AWCACeD5IxWefVJwvFCE,"Terribly managed hotel. Probably the worst hotel I have stayed in a while. Arrived late in the evening and found a que of guests trying to check in. One family with four kids apparently had booked two rooms via Expedia only to be told they had only one room with a king bed available. The two guys behind the counter had no clue what to do - listening to their phone conversation with (apparently) their manager, it seems they had a number of free rooms - but those had not been cleaned and where dirty. They also made everyone pay a 200 security fee - which upset several of the guests trying to check in. My room was prepaid and I did not have that problem. However, I needed to go three times up to my room on the 6th floor because the key card did not work - they then switched me to another room. The door of the first room had clear signs of an attempted break in. Since they could give me another room, why did they not give another one for this family Room was ok but smelled moldy. Breakfast was poor and breakfast room pretty dirty and unpleasant. To sum it up, I do not recommend this hotel. Should have chosen the Courtyard Marriott across the street instead - eventhoug it is a little more expensive. Other folks in my group stayed there - I should have done the same.",-1,0,0.630666667

The next morning I go down to the breakfast and there is the front desk in the dining area yelling at a couple because they were eating there. And then he goes and gets another female employee and she goes over and starts yelling at them. Granted the couple were not guests of the hotel. But everyone knows you should put on a professional face at all times. The could have asked them quietly to follow them out. Then after work I returned to my room to find that the maids and come in but didn't even replace the towels. This is the worst experience at a hotel I have ever had.

The next night my room was not cleaned at all, so you can imagine how upset I was. One night not cleaned, but two nights. When I complaint again, the front desk just told me it's not there problem. It's the cleaning employees so this upset me even more. They did give me some clean towels for that night so I can shower. Also, I felt the breakfast area was not kept up with the cleaning.

She transferred me to a voicemail where one of my options was to press zero for personal assistance (which is why I called). I was rerouted to the same woman who now seemed incredibly frustrated by me and insisted I leave a voicemail. She transfers me again. I just thought she could have been more polite and accommodating. I did get the issue sorted out, but the attitude of the woman on my initial phone call left a bad taste in my mouth. The location of this hotel is great, but the hotel itself isn't nice enough for the rate and the staff could use a lesson in manners and service.",-1,2,0.532083333

There was no real enforcement of any of the rules or common courtesies. The pool was only open until 1000 each night even though it is in a resort town were most activities run well into the evening. We were only able to use the pool once our entire stay. We used the laundry our last day there before our trip home and some of our clothes were stolen from the dryer. There was supposedly cameras there but we were told they could not access the video from them. Out of the entire 5 nights we were there the maid only serviced our room twice, but they were sure to leave a tip card in the room. If the service was exemplary we would have tipped them on our own. The balconies were covered with spiders. We told the front desk twice about it and their reply was to have the maid sweep it off. They then turned the lights off for the rest of our stay. Now we could not see the spiders on the chairs, the railings, and the doorways. Needless to say, no one used the balconies. Refridgerator in the room was not turned on, and when we did turn it on it was noisy and ineffective. The hotel itself looks like it needs updated badly.
