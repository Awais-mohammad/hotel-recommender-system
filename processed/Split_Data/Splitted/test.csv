AWCPOg2rRxPSIh2RpqQS,"Nice newer hotel. Very clean and staff are friendly. Plenty of shopping and restaurants nearby. Even an indoor go-cart track and miniature golf for the kids/grandkids. Would highly recommend staying at this hotel to friends and family, if in the Indianapolis area.",1,0.7375
116816253,"I must admit I picked this hotel thanks to tripadvisor but you win some and you lose some .After staying in Lucca at the most lovely Hotel Palazzo Busdraghi which my family loved and where we were treated like Royalty and very much wanted guests with smiles and &quot;how was your flight etc etc etc,to then go to this hotel was like walking into a bad dream.Very stroppy front of house service, One is greeted with a  &quot;can I have your passports&quot; The hotel staff greet one like a computer ,here is map for leaning tower (very sweet but Pisa has much more to offer than just the tower but the imagination of this staff is limited) and then bar room next door.Then when one asks again about the food in the bar room one is looked at like a complete moran. Why do some hotel staff feel that they are better than their guest and try and show a boring indifference to anything they say? When one asks here about a restaurant they try and send you to the Pizza place around the corner,When one checks the free bar food area next door one is greeted by a grumpy looking barman and a few plated of half eaten food and no people , no atmoshere and vert dark,maybe the lack of people tells you something, The hotel location away from the major sites is not a problem and we decided to stay here as it is near the major shopping area but ley me tell you the staff stink! The rooms are alright ,we did get eaten alive by some bed bugs on our legs from the room, I was going to say something the next day when we checked out but when I htold my room number I was then handed a bill and paid quikly as I honestly could not wait to leave the hotel, Even the lady at the front desk could not ask us if we enjoyed our stay or anything,just the normal grunt from the staff hereOn a brighter note breakfast is excellent but why such grumpy staff walking around -does anyone like their job here! hahahahahahah.Very expensive for the bed bug bites and the stroppy staff !Remember hotel Bologna first impressions are lasting ones and your staff really do need to go to customer service school!Advice find another hotel in Pisa and pay half the price as you do not get what you pay for here!",-1,0.4539754689754689

Duly down to th he manager pulling the waiter from fetching our bill to attend to a conference party. Room is 3 star but clean and well kept. No coffee or tea facilities.

246446936,This is a beautiful hotel in a great location. Within walking distance to all of the Old Quebec streets and site seeing attractions. We were greeted warmly  and friendly. Our room wasn t ready but they quickly informed us that another one was ready which ended up being an upgrade. Our family of 4 had a lovely Fairmont room with 2 double beds.

450863234,My wife and I stayed here for a couple nights the end of December. Great spot from which to explore Quebec. Room was clean and well appointed. Breakfast was tasty with plenty of options. You are right across the street from The MusÃ©e de la civilisation and it is for sure worth a visit. Plenty of restaurants nearby and close to the train station.,1,0.594920634920635

She was pleasant and was able to answer my questions regarding my special dietary requirements knowledgeably and with confidence. My room was a suite in the Royal Palms Tower and it was clean, spacious and in good condition. Sunshine coming through the east facing windows was enjoyable.

200466964,"We re-visited this wonderful hotel and hoped it hadn't changed its character.  What a relief!  It is totally still charming, and the staff are incredible.  No-one isn't smiling - and they are all helpful, genuinely friendly and efficient, without being remotely 'cheesy'.  The roof terrace is beautiful (in full bloom) and a fantastic spot to do a bit of laid-back 'bat spotting' with a bottle of (incredibly reasonably price) wine. At the risk of the prices shooting up when they next see a booking request from me - we can honestly say we wouldn't stay anywhere else in that city. The Royal Victoria Hotel makes Pisa for us!

Only caution is that the rooms are not air conditioned. Because you are in the mountains it does cool off at night but on hot days the rooms get warm, especially during the day. The hotel does have mobile fans in the rooms to help.

The front desk staff is exceptionally service oriented and very helpful. The rooms are very clean and the hotel is in a safe area. It is a short bus ride to center of town- they sell bus tickets at a reduced rate ($1 euro) - we managed to get around fine. We would definitely return.

443631595,"We came up here to do the Vancouver Xmas thing and we chose this hotel due to it's location to the skytrain, shopping and the value. I can't say it was a great value, but considering it's near Vancouver, it's better then Vancouver prices. It's very close to the skytrain, you can see it from the room (we were on the 11th floor). Hint: walk through the mini strip mall place across the street (dollarama, best buy) as it's a closer walk then going around the buildings. It snowed the weekend we were there, which added to the Xmas feeling, so going through the shortcut was nice as the sidewalks were pretty slushy. This hotel literally shares a corridor with an asian market, food court type place, so lots to choose from if you're wanting asian food. Metrotown Mall is across the street as well, we could see the parking garage from our room, but we never went to the mall. As far as parking, we did the valet, not sure it's worth the difference, but never went into the garage so don't know the difficulty of getting in and out, however, the valet staff were nice. We only used them to park the car at check in and retrieve it at checkout, but they were friendly. The front desk staff were very friendly and honest. When i asked about doing an upgrade, she told me since we were already on the 11th floor, there wouldn't really be a benefit to upgrading. The room was pretty small, but we weren't there to stay in the room so it was fine. The only thing that really bugged me, but had no impact on my stay was the bathroom door was spring loaded so it closed automatically. That got annoying when I was only going in to blow my nose or throw something away. Another thing to note in case it matters is the tub is short. I&quot;m only 5'3 and i had to bend my knees while soaking sore muscles, so my knees weren't in the water.The bed was super comfy and we wanted to take the comforter home. It's kind of cramped by the door with the closet literally right inside the door so it makes maneuvering  luggage through the door kind of a challenge, but not to bad. The breakfast buffet was very nice, lots to choose from, a more formal setting, friendly staff. Overall, it was a nice hotel, friendly staff, close to the skytrain and shopping and a very comfy bed..",1,0.6032423538521099

So, they found me an alternate treatment to try - Shiatsu - at NO COST!! I wasn't expecting that, and it truly made my day. That's only one of the reasons I come back every few months to this wonderful establishment. There's something about the incredible atmosphere that de-stresses you the moment you walk through their doors. Not to mention the incredible food during lunch and afternoon tea.

294071190,"I stayed in this hotel 2 years ago with my son as we had a couple of days to kill before we were due to meet with relatives at Pisa airport. I had chosen this hotel because it was right opposite Pisa Centrale railway station and we had decided that whilst we had time to kill we'd visit Florence. Staying here made this so very easy, the hotel room was one of the brightest, cleanest rooms i've ever stayed in, we'd upgraded so that it would make it more of a treat and it certainly was, there wasn't anything we had to ask for, in the bathroom there was everything from body lotions to razors, my son said it was the best hotel he'd ever stayed in. Last week myself and partner stayed here for one night only, as i was highly recommending it to him and we wanted to be close enough to the main attraction, nice restaurants and importantly again the train station. We arrived very early, before the room was ready but it wasn't a problem, i was shown to a bathroom where i could change out of my travelling clothes, our luggage was safely stored and we headed out for an afternoon of sightseeing. When we returned we headed to the room, it was so beautifully cool and air conditioned, once again there was everything we could have needed, and we will definitely stay there again.

Close to bus stop to Pisa or Livorno ( ticket costs 2-3 EURO). Italian style of making money on tourism always disappointing me. In Tirrenia most of the beaches are not free of charge.

173896302,"We stayed here for 2 nights at the end of  July. We had a room, bathroom and outdoor seating/kitchen area which is fully equipped with everything you need.  Campsite full and we were near the entrance and there was very little noise. The staff were great, everything was very clean, and we had air con, sheets and we knew to take towels from the website. We also took a washing up cloth and washing up liquid in a small travel bottle. We have stayed in quite a few hotels and B&amp;Bs in Pisa but prefer this site for its location and the fact we could park and leave the car during the day with no problems (we have had to use public parking or meters in some other areas of Pisa).  Very easy to get to from Pisa airport (5 minute drive in almost a straight line).  We used the local train  station (5 minute walk) to catch train to Siena (ticket machine is on the platform and does translate to English).  We also walked into Pisa (turn left out of campsite, cross the road and straight line under the underpass and the right at the roundabout). The underpass might look scary if you are not used to city living but we found it safe and still used it at 12.30 at night with no cause for any concern. Pool small and very busy but you can sit in the bar area and still enjoy the atmosphere or you could drive/train it to the beach. We would not hesitate to stay again - a great stop over, lovely atmosphere, very friendly staff, very clean and such a convenient location to use as a base to explore Toscana. You can stay on site and use facilities after you have booked out - so great for late afternoon/evening flights.",1,0.5079126984126985

The bathroom was outstanding and the shower was simply brilliant!The bar is lovely and again the service very friendly and efficient, the food is also lovely and I would definitely recommend the afternoon tea!

502943988,"This hotel is far from downtown, though it is within a 5 minute walk of the trolley.  It's about a 30 minute ride to the convention center and costs $5 a day with the compass card.  I stayed in an unrennovated room and while it was absolutely spotlessly clean, the decor and furnishings were dated, nothing at all like what is shown in the website.  This is not a 5 star property, though if the rooms are updated it could be.The staff were very professional, although surprisingly there was a long line for check in.  They knew a major conference was in town and the conference booked our rooms well in advance, so they knew we were coming and what day, yet there were empty terminals without staff.  There are two restaurants on the property, both of which are good and the wait staff were exceptional.All in all, the dated room and location make this property not worth the price paid for a convention goer or anyone who wants to be downtown.  There are cheaper properties closer who're just as good.",0,0.4715384615384614
130894448,"I didn't have high expectations for a Holiday Inn but this one was really comfortable and nice. Quite competitive in terms of the rooms and the comfort.I arrived a few hours before official check-in and had a meeting coming up. The staff was able to get me my room ahead of time so that I could prepare, which was much appreciated. I had a basic room with two beds but it was spacious, had lots of natural light and looked like new. The bathroom was very clean and had no trace of wear. The beds came with pillows with two types of firmness. And free wifi has become far too rare so I was delighted.I ordered a modest continental breakfast to the room and it came on time and was great. Fresh fruit, yogurt, toast, juice, tea.The towels weren't the fanciest, but considering the rest it doesn't matter. I had no trouble with the wifi and according to another review here it looks like you can request a fridge if you want one. Somewhat surprisingly, my stay here was on par with stays in more expensive hotel chains in big cities.  Includes: free wifi, iron and ironing board, pool, shower cap, shampoo and conditioner, flat screen TV, hair dryer.Didn't include: mini bar/fridge, shower gel.",1,0.5637310606060605
128616738,"Stayed at Relais Sassetti for four nights in April. The location is great right in the centre of town so access to everything is just a short walk. The apartment is very clean and well looked after and Simona is very welcoming. Our first night was a Friday and the noise in the Lion apartment was unbelievably loud, there is street running right outside the window and the next two nights were so loud I understood what the two pairs of ear plugs on the dresser were for! Saturday night was terrible noise too, Sunday wasn't as bad and Monday was quiet. I do appreciate this is a town centre apartment but feel you should know just how noisy it is before booking. The only other thing I would say is that the apartment was chilly and as much as we tried to use the heating we couldn't feel warm. On a plus side Simona is very nice and brought me honey and lemon when I woke up with a cold on the third morning but I feel not sleeping for two night and feeling cold all the time didn't really help.",1,0.5662400793650794
10037108,"We just checked in.  We weren't expecting anything fancy ( when you're staying at a hotel a couple of miles from sea world for $100 a night &amp; all the rooms open up to the outside, you shouldn't expect fancy), but although we've only been here a couple of hours, I'm already a little disappointed.  We went to swim in the pool after a very long day of travel, and the pool is very very cold.  Can't get used to it cold.  Which, fine, cheap hotel = unheated pool, but also it appears that the filters aren't running at all.  There were quite a few bugs &amp; debris in the water, and it looked filmy.  Then we realized that there was no filter-y sounds or movement, nor was there even a hint of a bleachy smell (have you ever stayed at a pool that didn't at least give you a whif of bleach?).  We all grimaced at eachother, and walked out of the water.The room is okay, smells a little damp but not musty.  Wireless internet service obviously works, staff seems friendly &amp; helpful, and the location is very hand for people from out of town that don't want to spend all day getting somewhere. So , in the end, probably won't stay here again, but probably won't go through the hassle of changing hotels.  That is subject to change - we're in San Diego for a week, so...",0,0.5362962962962964

217747794,"I stayed in the Town and Country resort with my girlfriend and another friend in July. We were attending the NOAH conference which was in the on-site conference centre.Check-in:Upon check-in, we were told that the two King rooms that we booked were not available, and we could have 2x2 Queen rooms instead. We were given the option of moving the following day, which we declined, but in this age of modern electronic booking, there is no real reason that this should happen.We were also assured that the rooms we were allocated were right next door to each other, only to find they were at opposite ends of the building! To their credit, a quick call to the front desk sorted this out and one room was exchanged for one right next door to the other. However, you would expect hotel staff to have at least some idea of where rooms actually were, or failing that, consult a map!The Rooms:The rooms themselves (in the Regency Tower) were adequate, but not great. Both of them had a big picture of a creepy-looking young girl overlooking the bed, not something you want to wake up to! Also, the tub in one of the bathrooms had spots which initially looked like blood, but turned out to be rust!Only the toilet and bath/shower were behind a separate door, the basin area was not separated from the main room, not great for anyone wanting a bit of extra privacy.Facilities:The hotel facilities were OK. There are three pools and a jacuzzi, and free towels were provided.There was a coin operated laundry on site, very useful when on holiday for a couple of weeks.We only used Charlie's bar for food (which was decent quality at sensible prices) and the Terraces Cafe for breakfast, which was overpriced for what it was.Staff:The staff were generally friendly, and tried to be helpful. However, their knowledge of the hotel wasn't always up to scratch, as evidenced by the problems at check-in and the fact that we had to ask 3 of them before we found one who knew where the laundry was.Value For Money:Value for money at the hotel wasn't great. We booked as part of a flight/hotel package, so the rooms weren't too expensive, however, since we booked, the hotel had introduced a $14/night 'Resort Fee'. This mainly seems to include providing towels at the pool, a couple of small bottles of water and free wi-fi in the rooms (which wasn't great quality). Fortunately we were aware of the new fee when we checked in, and when I queried it, they agreed to waive the fee because we'd booked before it was introduced. However, on checkout, they had still added it to the bill on one of the rooms (though removed it when I complained). I strongly suspect if I hadn't been aware of the change, and hadn't carefully checked the bill, they would've charged us the fee regardless.Breakfast at $15.95 is a total rip-off for a 'serve yourself' buffet. The food was adequate, but at that price, I'd expect a much better range and better quality. We were also told that the price included either a hot drink or orange juice, but if you wanted both you had to pay extra!Location:The hotel is located in Mission Valley, quite a way out from Downtown San Diego. The Fashion Valley Transit Center is right behind the hotel, so it's easy to get a Trolley to Old Town or  downtown. We didn't have a car, but it also seems nice and easy to access from the main roads nearby.Verdict:Town &amp; Country is OK if you are staying for a conference on site, or desperately want a resort hotel. However, if you just want somewhere to sleep while exploring the many attractions of San Diego, there are much better options elsewhere.",0,0.4781455104035748

There are plenty of hotels to stay in, but if you want a cozy, intimate hotel in the heart of the French Quarter, the Cornstalk Hotel is perfect.

I was answered with a rude &quot;no&quot; and therefore handed the phone to my Italian speaking friend who explained my situation, the answer was along the lines of &quot;It's not our concern&quot; and the conversation soon escalated, with the woman on the phone using a profanity and then hanging up.This behaviour is utterly unacceptable, and I was left to find alternatives for my night, otherwise stranded.Even if there was nothing they could do about letting me stay, some politeness would have been appreciated.

Normally parking is $12 per night and you have to pay for Wi-Fi.-centrally located, close to mall, easy access to freeway, really close to seaworld, downtown san diego, zoo, etc.-lots of towels provided, nice TV and room furnitureThe bad stuff:-something came out of the drain the first time we turned on the  shower - it was like a large cockroach or something, about the size of an inch. it wouldn't go down either, had to keep putting extra hot water as it scurried around. Scared the bejezzus out of me and my son.  -had some water dripping out of the air conditioning in the morning. We were in a hurry to get to legoland so I we just put the ice bucket under the leak and said we'd come back in the evening to report it but it stopped.  The air conditioning is on the ceiling so it was dripping down to the carpet. Wonder how often it does that.  -complimentary breakfast (also a part of the online deal) was a joke! I understand continental but it was kind of ridiculous, I've had so much better free breakfasts at other cheaper hotels.  It consisted of some cut up fruit, yogurt, some croissants and apple pastries that were too small and hard, and I think you could order toast/a bagel.  We had breakfast for 2 for 2 days and on the 2nd day we didn't even bother, we just went out for breakfast.Most likely we won't return - but I rated it average because it wasn't an awful stay and the positive stuff really was positive.

156630844,"The Farmer's Daughter boutique hotel was one of the more pleasant surprises I've had while traveling. When I travel for business, it's usually for a purpose, but when I travel for vacation, I like to be entertained and try something new. If you're the same way, you're going to love this experience.As I mentioned, great spot for TV Fans, directly across the street from CBS Television City (for The Price is Right, Late Show with Craig Ferguson, etc.), you're within a two minute walk. You're also about five minutes from the Grove, which has shopping and boutique restaurants (and also films TV's Extra on premises daily). Throw in access to a local Farmer's market, plus some other fantastic amenities, and you're set to come here without a car and still have a great time.Now to the hotel itself? Some reviews may throw around 'motel' or other lower terms, but if you expect to have a smaller room, you'll be fine. The amenities could be better, the beds are firm and the bathroom could use some updating, but the pool filled with rubber ducks and the on site free chocolate chip cookies and lemonade are outstanding. Couple that with a great built in restaurant that brings room service in a picnic basket and you're all set.But here's the real hidden gem of this hotel that I can sum up in one word: Ted. No, not the Mark Wahlberg movie, I'm talking about Ted, the night desk manager who can share with you the secrets to getting on The Price is Right? Don't believe me, then check out the hundreds of Polaroids featuring guests who stayed and how they got on the show. His late night class was a great way to wind down the evening and learn about getting on the show. He will share with you little secrets about what you say on the lot and how you speak to the producers can give you the edge to get to contestants row. I can't say if someone in my group got on the show, but I can say we had an amazing time and walked away with some great memories :).All in all, I encourage you to 'Do It at the Daughter' (their theme, not mine) and spend a few nights here. If you're in town for a short time, and coming with an older family, girls weekends, guys weekends, or just a couple, you'll be glad you did. Older folks and those who aren't used to city life may be a little overwhelmed, but this roll in the hay will be fun, and definitely the experience you'll remember in the future.",1,0.514492936004564

The cafÃ© had a quaint menu and I had a fabulous dinner there one night. Highly recommend the Chocolate Pot De CrÃ¨me for dessert.

This tour takes you all over San Diego and you can hop on and off...another trolley will pick you up within 30 minutes of each stop. There is a walkway leading from the hotel to the Fashion Valley Mall where you will find 200 shops and a food court. Prices were really good. I bought 5 outfits for under $100.00 Great Value. Beautiful Place.  Highly recommend.",1,0.6441836734693877
144980237,We recently had our first family vacation to San Diego and found this hotel on line.we chose it because of the central location to the zoo and Sea World and I'm glad we did.The staff here are very friendly and very helpful.Having never been to San Diego before we naturally had a lot of questions about everything and the staff here were very accommodating to ever question we had.The free shuttle was great my 3 year old son loved riding the&quot;bus&quot; everywhere we went.They even went out of their way to take us to mission beach one day even though that is not one of the stops.The shuttle driver Jeff greeted my son by name every morning and would joke around with him and talk to him about his day at Sea World or wherever we might have been that day.It definitely made our family vacation that much better.I would definitely stay here again and recommend this hotel to all of my family and friends. The only fault I can find is the menu in the restaurant is quite small and with eating there almost every night we tried everything on the menu.a bigger menu might be an idea.in saying that everything we ate was very delicious.Thank you to everyone you made our stay a family vacation we will never forget.,1,0.4964912280701755
349905396,"I have stayed at this hotel many times whilst visiting Glasgow on business and just realised I haven't submitted a review.The hotel is quite close to the M74, so is ideal for travellers to find.The hotel is located on a retail park and is surrounded by restaurants and shops.I find the welcome is always warm and the rooms are clean and functional.The breakfast is good, with a choice of cereals, fruit, pastries and normally sausages and scrambled eggs and beans.WiFi is generally OK but can slow down when the hotel is full.Local places to eat are: Pizza Hut, Chiquitos, Frankie &amp; Benny's, McDonalds. There is also an Asda 5 minutes walk away.

Of the available options in the immediate area, this is probably better than average.  I felt the pricing was a bit high but that was probably due to the July 4th holiday.  I would consider staying here again, but I'd look around for another deal first.Before staying here I read the reviews about the renovation.

148801940,"I stayed at this hotel with my boyfriend for 2 nights in August 2012. When we arrived there was a very helpful member of staff who showed us up the stairs to our room. The place is full of character and we were made to feel very welcome. Our room was medium sized with shutters opening out onto the main shopping street below. Considering this, we were not once disturbed by  noise. The bedroom had an en-suite shower room which was clean and spacious, with fresh towels replaced daily. The room itself was traditionally decorated, with a huge mural painted across the ceiling. The room had a mini-bar containing beers and water which were reasonably priced. One evening we asked a member of staff if they could provide us with glasses and a bottle opener which they very happily did. Breakfast was served in a small but beautiful, airy room with pink and white table cloths and an array of delicious italian foods on offer. We enjoyed freshly made coffee, juices, pastries and meats. They also had freshly baked cakes on offer. All in all it was a very enjoyable stay. I'd actually booked into a more expensive hotel for our final stay thinking we deserved a bit of luxury - but when we arrived there, we wished we were back at Relais Centro Storico. The more expensive hotel was slightly further out of town and didn't have as much character or authenticity as Relais Centro Storico. If we go back to Pisa I'll definitely stay at this hotel again - for longer this time.If you're looking for a romantic break, or a hotel that epitomises Italian charm then stay here.",1,0.5003921568627451

I complained on the fourth day and the lady in charge of housekeeping came immediately and made the beds, gave us fresh towels and dusted the room.

Sadly it does not give a good impression of the hotel.  On a positive side, Harvey (I think he was Guest Relations Manager) was lovely and went out of his way to be friendly and helpful to guests.  Whenever you saw him he had a smile on his face and spoke to everyone.  What a nice man and a real credit to the hotel.I would definitely stay at this hotel again.  The food was delicious.

Our room had a fabulous view of the beach but that was all it had going for it.Area around hotel was dirty, hippy type of town with homeless people all around the hotel and sleeping on the beach day and night. Police were in the area alot.Hotel was dirty. Our bathroom was so bad I took a shower with my flip flops on. Broken tiles, peeling paint, no stopper in the drain (cap for toothpaste went in and went straight down).Wall very thin, could hear neighbors kids at 6 AM and then mom yelling at them for another hour. Street noise was all night long along with the barking dogs in the hotel and on the street. And the planes went over starting promptly at 6 AM and sounded like they were going to scrap the roof they were so low and loud.Big portable A/C unit sitting on the floor on one side of the bed and took up  most of the room on that side of the bed. Nice big sliding window but no screen, so that some one could have literally reached in an touched my husband while we were in bed.

20532193,"The Auberge Saint-Antoine is a gem in so many ways.  Other reviews have hit the highlights, so I will briefly describe my experience. The hotel is located near the river at the bottom of the steep hills of the historic area.  It's a 2-3 minute walk to the main historic area, maybe 10 minutes uphill to the massive Chateau Frontenac, and 15 -20 minutes to other parts of the old city.I was booked here for only one night, unfortunately, and had only 22 hours in Quebec City.  Nonetheless, I took great advantage of this marvel of a hotel.  It is built entirely around an old artillery fortress and they have remarkably integrated the ruins with modern architecture.  The bar is located in a sunken area next to the lobby, giving it an open, yet comfy and secluded feeling.  The lobby is beautiful and has a very warm feeling.The staff, well, they are friendly, unpretentious, and very efficient.The rooms are great, but I will admit that I only saw my room, which was a superior room.  There is a small corridor to the bathroom which has an espresso maker and open closet.  The bathroom was very well fitted with two sinks, heated floor, shower and bath, and toilet.  The amenities were great.The bed area was spacious with a large desk, free wireless, plasma tv, two chairs and ottoman, and a walkout balcony with chairs.  The view was odd, a metal roof obstructs the view of the river.  The bed was great and very comfortable.I ordered coffee in the morning and it was delivered in about 10 minutes by a gorgeous server who promptly returned with sugar and a smile. The gym has a great sauna, showers, towels, plenty of weights, and cardio equipment that surrounds a tree.  The architecture of the gym is fantastic with a nice blend of old and modern.This is by far one of the best hotels I have had the pleasure of visiting.  The staff make it even more enjoyable as too often, luxury or botique hotels find staff who act as though they can afford to stay their themselves and develop a false arrogance.  Not the case here, they were all friendly and down to earth.",1,0.5184142545907252

641890268,"I stayed for 1 night in November and as my title says, I really wanted to like this hotel. It is not far from the train station and not far from the Leaning Tower complex. Our room wasn't ready on arrival which I was expecting as we arrived around 12 pm. Daniel I think his name was very nice and helpful.  He showed us where to store our luggage and provided us with a map and some directions. He told us if we needed dinner recommendations to just come back. When we did, he was very nice after we kept going back to ask about other resturants.  The car service to the airport went smoothly and glad I booked directly with the hotel. We also had a balcony. This unfortunately are all the positives I can list. Now to the negatives. We were upgraded to a bigger room with a queen size bed and two twin beds. It was bigger than what I reserved but how could that be a negative right? Well, the room smelled like a sweet cedar smell almost like a moldy smell that they were trying to cover up. The shower stall was extremely small and I am only 5'4 and weigh 115 pounds. My biggest complaint though was the man we encountered back at the reception desk.  We went back to have reception make us a dinner reservation at a local pizzeria after Daniel gave some recommendations. It was our last night in Italy and I wanted to have good pizza. The man at the desk was not the same person who was helping us earlier. When we told him what we wanted, he snickered and in a snotty tone, said the place did not accept reservations. I should have questioned him but thought it was just a pizzeria. Well, he was wrong. When we went there they turned us away saying they were booked for the night. We could not get into any of the other resturants around there. We could only get seated at a place near the train station where the food wasn't that great. This really ruined my last night in Italy. It shouldn't matter on what kind of food we wanted or maybe how cheap it seemed, it was something I wanted. When we got back to the hotel, I badly wanted to give this negative feedback but the man who insisted reservations weren't needed, wasn't there. So thank you for ruining my last meal in Italy.",-1,0.4827947845804988

I asked him if we can get a room in one of the towers he said all were booked so we were assigned a room some where else. I wasn't sure of it since I've read before that the other rooms were disgusting and dirty. So we had no other choice and took the room. I had asked if we can switch rooms the following day if a guest checked out from a tower room. He said yes and wrote down our information. I also asked if there was a fee for the switch of rooms and he told me No. When we booked the room, it was advertised with free breakfast like previous years. When we finished getting checked in, I asked about our breakfast pass and was told that our reservation didn't include that. I told him that when we reserved our room It said free breakfast, he just looked at me and said that we could pay for it and it was $15 per person. I said no Thank you and left disappointed. We go to our room and it looked ok. There was a funky smell when we turned on the A/C. The next morning before we left to the convention i called the front desk to ask for any available rooms. The person said there is one but there was a fee for it. I said oh really, i explained to her about the gentleman who told us it was going to be free and no extra charges. She said no, and it was going to be $15 to $80 a night for the change. i told her never mind, and requested a refrigerator. She said it was going to be $15 a day. I said no and hanged up. I was just so confused with all these lies and deception from the staff. After that we really wanted to leave and go to another place. But we knew with the convention going on it was going to be impossible and expensive. So we stayed and tried to enjoy the rest of our trip. When we went to the front desk to check out on Sunday morning the gentleman who helped us at check in assisted us again. I had told him about what happened with the room and all he said was sorry. So when we were waiting for our receipt he told us we had a charge of $28 for parking. I told him No since he gave us a free parking pass. He looked at me like if i was lying to him and told me to bring him the pass. So we left to pick up the pass and walked back to the front desk. But when we arrived he saw us and left to the back room. So the next person who assisted us was really nice and kind and she deducted the parking fee for us. So overall, after this visit. I don't think we will be coming back to this hotel. I understand they have to cater to other guest. But after so many he said she said situation and the staff not being well informed and misinforming the guests.

On arrival, the man at reception was fairly indignant when I asked for the parking details because he said I had not booked parking.  I said that on the website it says parking available and I was unaware of needing to book.  After about 5 minutes of discussing he gave me a piece of paper which was a ticket to put in my car to park outside the hotel anywhere along the road!!!  They have not got an actual car park - you just park outside the hotel and they charge you 6 euros for the pleasure.  The hotel itself was so bad.  It has a four star rating and on viewing the entrance and lobby area you could almost believe that I suppose.  It has free wifi there and some comfortable sofas.  The rooms however are shocking!  The first room they gave us was at the back of the hotel and had two twin beds and literally looked like my nan's house 40 years ago!  Dated decor, unwelcoming room, disgusting bathroom etc.  I went to reception and said I had booked a double bed and I would like a different room.  The manager then came to see me and he did give us a different room.  Again dated, the bed was awful and the bathroom had stains on the ceramic where it was so old.  We paid Â£85 for one night for two people bed and breakfast.  So it was not overly cheap, but not expensive either.  The breakfast however was also terrible.  Cereal was like cardboard, orange juice was horrible, coffee barely drinkable.  If you wanted a cooked breakfast you had to pay extra, but we didn't chance it.  The only positive thing this hotel has is it's location.  It is literally two minutes walk from the tower of Pisa and the central area.  They seriously need to update their rooms and need to be a more welcoming hotel to even come close to a four star though.  I would avoid this hotel at all costs.",-1,0.5283670033670033

They offered the option of moving next door for only a little more money, so we took them up on it.The Saint-Pierre is the older property, and it showed.  The lobby and rooms were a little shabby, I thought, and the decoration truly minimal.  The people were outstandingly friendly and helpful.  That made it all the more shocking when we and our friends both discovered that our beds had not been made after our first night, even though the spreads were pulled up so they appeared to have been done, and the rooms showed other signs of having been visited by the housekeeping folks.In the rooms themselves, there were some odd omissions. For example, there were essentially no horizontal surfaces where you could put down luggage, other than the floor.  Same was true in the bathroom and two people's toiletries..  The coffee-maker was installed inside the top section of the only real chest of any sort, with a cord so short that you had to unplug it each time you wanted to add water or coffee.  The TV was on top of the chest.  There was no channel guide for the TV, or instructions for using the telephone.  The former is a particular issue for English-speakers in a French-speaking area, since so many channels are in French.I can't complete this review without applauding the included breakfast.

Not only is the facade beautiful, and of course, the famous cornstalk wrought iron fence out front, but every space within this charming hotel oozes elegance and comfort. The high ceilings, luxurious fabrics and sparkling chandeliers make you feel gloriously pampered. One of the nicest features of the hotel is the inviting second story balcony which overlooks Royal Street, where you can relax, take it all in, and of course people-watch. There is also an equally lovely front porch where you can do the same. The guest rooms and bathrooms are beautifully appointed and have been recently (and very thoughtfully)Â updated.

There was good soundproofing so we did not hear street noise (the train station is also where a lot of buses stop).  Breakfast buffet was quite good although there were some issues with their coffee machine.  The shower in our room opened on two sides and leaked out into the bathroom no matter how careful we were to try to get the doors lined up carefully.  From the appearance of the ceiling above our shower and the condition of the tile in our bathroom, this design flaw appears to be an issue in multiple rooms.

We had not been to the city and I researched lots of hotels.  Although I almost went with a few other boutique hotels, I'm glad we chose this for our first visit.  The location is perfect.  The Furnicular lift is steps from the hotel's doors and will take you down to the restaurants, shops, and bars of Old Quebec.  On the main level, you're within walking distance to other restaurants, bars, and attractions.  The interior has old world charm with some modern touches.  We had queen bed room with a basic view.  The room itself was rather average, somewhat small, but comfortable and fair given the price and the location of this hotel.  The bathroom was a bit small, but clean, and the shower was great.  Overall, no complaints with the room.  The pool and gym area were nice, with rooftop patios etc.  The 1608 Wine &amp; Cheese bar located on the main floor of the hotel, has an elevated look over the river and Old Quebec.  It is located in a 'turret' of the castle and the view is phenomenal.  What a place to have a drink and the service was fantastic.  The only frustration was with valet.  The valet staff were very courteous and working very hard.  There were simply so many guests and the parking situation was difficult and so it took quite awhile to retrieve our vehicle  and retrieve items from it.

For a cheap tasty dinner we did eat at Le Buffet D'Antiquaire on St-Paul Street... quick comfort food where dinner for two was about $30!

We did have an issue with the air conditioning the first night of our stay and called down to the concierge at about 2am.  The air seemed to be on but no COLD air was coming out of the vents.

(The Barefoot Bistro, on the other hand, was a COMPLETE RIPOFF at $400 for two for a 3 course New Years Dinner at 6pm (we were told it would be a five course) menu plus $35/glass of champagne...I've had better food at my local bistro that this supposed upscale place! And the wine list $$ was at least triple - I'm a big foodie and wine lover!)Next year we plan to heli-ski there...it is the best - and I'm a CO native! And, of course, we'll use the miles to get to Vancouver!",1,0.4837194525904204

130634590,"Monica provides a lovely, friendly and personal service. We emailed her prior to our arrival, asking the best way to get to the hotel from the Airport and she gave us a comprehensive amount of detail on buses and taxis, but advised that a taxi would be easiest and would be 10-15 EUR, which it was.Upon arrival we were given a detailed map of the area, showing us where the main attractions were, and the local supermarket, and also recomending a few local restaurants. As part of this we were given expectations of how far these places were to walk to which was really helpful. She also said if there was any information we needed about train times or anything else, to ask and she would find out for us.The room was a very good size, comfortable, clean &amp; tidy, with tea and coffee facilities in the room. Bathroom was also very clean, towels and linen changed daily and the shower was excellent. Free Wifi was available too.Breakfast was also excellent, a wide variety of bread, meat, cheese and a different homemade savoury tart each day and also homemade sweet tarts and cakes. Location was excellent, about 15-20 mins walk to where the main shops are, and about 25-30 mins walk to the tower and duomo complex.I definitely recommend this B&amp;B as a good value place to stay in a great location in Pisa.",1,0.541888888888889

Room was dirty and had electric wires hanging out of socket, we booked economy room as we thought we would hardly be in the room due to travelling to Florence , Lucca etc by train but had to  change rooms as at cost of 10Euro which was not a problem but next room was not much better, shower was poor with hardly any pressure and went from boiling hot to cold for no apparent reason so luckily it was only a drizzle out of the shower !! This bathroom was also dirty and shower door was held together with tie wraps and hard to close.

The staff we encountered were amazing and couldn't have been nicer or more helpful  5 Stars to the employees (with the exception of valet).Multiple options within walking distance for food, drink, shopping and so on.  The feel of being in the middle of the city.   My only complaint was the parking.  They have a parking garage attached to the hotel however about 98% of it is reserved for valet, leaving only about 20 spots for self park.  Hotel clearly is trying to push guest to valet only at a higher cost.  This might not have been so bad but it took forever for someone in valet to come take the car and return it back to us.  If they are going to basically only give you a valet option, then someone needs to light a fire under those valet employees to start providing better service.",1,0.601578947368421

The room was amazing, the service amazing, the hotel decor amazing and the limited food we tried was delicious.  I had a fabulous massage from a young woman on a Saturday morning, I would not choose the spa as an all day event place but if you are looking for a top notch massage before sightseeing this was perfect.  The valet who helped us each morning was beyond helpful and friendly.  Lovely turndown service and amazing history of the property seeping into each room.  Loved it.

635497365,"I wrote the review below without reading any of the already posted reviews. Here I was thinking my visit was extraordinarily special....but then I'm reading hundreds of other reviews of people who were made to feel just as special! This place is magical, and it's all because of the people!  If you don't stay here, you're crazy. And now for my review......I had the great privilege of staying at The Pomeroy Kananaskis Mountain Lodge in October 2018, and from the moment I pulled up to the property, to the moment I left, the stay was absolutely perfect. The property itself is lovely, complete with cozy seating areas, fireplaces and stunning landscape. But what really made the stay special were the people. From the wonderful concierge, Mouricio, who welcomed us when we pulled up in our car as he was throwing fresh wood on the outdoor firepit (that smelled sooooooooo goooood) to the incredibly kind and welcoming associate who checked us in (Tenzin N.) who went above and beyond to accommodate us, despite the short notice of the reservation.We visited in what seems to have been the small âoff seasonâ between summer visitors winding down and the start of winter ski season, so for the first few days, we seemed to have the place to ourselves. That said, even as the occupancy increased significantly, it still felt very intimate. The rooms were simply perfect. Impeccably clean, stunning views out every window, light bright modern design and appointments. It was just so luxurious, but at a Courtyard by Marriott price point!And the spaâ¦.I meanâ¦I just canât even describe this experience. âHot, Warm, Cold, Rest, Repeat.â This may not make sense now, but it will after your stay, and it will be a memory that stays with you for a life time. Imagine sitting in a hot pool, surrounded by mountains and trees, itâs snowingâ¦.youâve just come out of the eucalyptuses steam roomâ¦..and you know that in 30 minutes, youâre going to jump into the cold pool (even though you said you werenât going to) and youâre going to feel a sense of life and rejuvenation and renewal you didnât think was possible! And this description doesnât even come close to telling the whole story!I got a 90-minute-deep tissue massage from Derek, which was incredible, and also took advantage of the bright, open fitness center with equipment that looked brand new!And the food, letâs talk about the food. We were there long enough to eat at every single restaurant, including the pub thatâs in an adjacent building (ahhhâ¦.the Sheppardâs Pie!) The food was delicious and well prepared, but the highlight for us by far was the âBlueberry Teaâ (donât be deceivedâ¦.it has teaâ¦.but it also has booze, and ironically, no blueberries) at Blacktails with those homemade Salt and Vinegar chips. (I ate an embarrassing amount of potato chips during my stay, which was fully supported by the delightful waitstaff!) Oh, and they host a n outdoor smoreâs Marshmallow Roast each evening, complete with wool blankets to keep you warm!So, Iâve talked about the property, the accommodations, the food, the spa, and the people. So, I want to close this review by once again talking about the people. The people is what makes Kananaskis special. Everyone from the valet/concierge, front desk, spa, housekeeping, waitstaff/servers were unbelievable. Iâm looking forward to my return trip and more Blueberry Tea and jumps into the cold pool!",1,0.655399877899878
169720952,"I booked this room (at a very reasonable rate given the location central to everything in L.A.) for a 4-night stay with my 12 year old son--we were there to see all the sights.  We arrived from San Diego, where we'd stayed at the Manchester Hyatt, a 30 story high-rise.   There, elevators broke down one day, took 2 1/2 hrs. after check in to get our room, the room was even smaller.  From one extreme to the other, the Farmer's was so much more peaceful.  While my son likes modern and futuristic and was a bit disappointed that it appeared to be a motel, I told him one day he would appreciate a hotel like the Farmer's.  Very cool courtyard, reception area, and dÃ©cor.  (And I just bought a scent fan and gardenia oil to see if I can replicate the divine(!) scent in the lobby.)  Our 1st floor room sat next to the alley and I heard very little noise.  Didn't hear any noise from the floors above, but being from Houston, we kept our a.c. on all the time and that blocked out a lot of things, I'm sure.  Other than the TV remote not being user-friendly, the only item I felt was a shortcoming was the lack of a dresser to stow our clothes--constantly shuffling and digging thru our suitcases wasn't always convenient.  The staff were a bit restrained--not overly friendly--and were on the young side, as other reviews have noted, but I considered that an L.A., West Hollywood thing and overlooked it.  Whenever I asked for anything, the staff was very friendly and helpful.  The valets were also quick to retrieve my car and helpful with directions.All in all, I would definitely recommend the Farmer's Daughter to those wanting a bit of an eclectic hotel experience in a great location.",1,0.5260683760683761

The staff was friendly and helpful, and spoke english well. This hotel met all of our expectations. The #4 bus goes right past the hotel - the stop is down the road about a block.

The suite was brilliant, having a seperate lounge was a plus, a nespresso coffee machine and huge tv.  The bathroom had seperate shower cubicle two washbasins, bathrobes and slippers.  The bedroom had a huge bed, extra pillows and lots of space to move around in.  We only had breakfast on our stay and we've always found it fine, plenty of choice and always perfectly presented with efficient service - Sundays are often a bit slow due to many guests having room service but they warn you of this in the public areas.  The staff are so friendly and helpful we probably would'nt consider staying anywhere else when in Manchester.  Many thanks to Andrew (reception) for the room upgrade x x",1,0.5220833333333333

Everything was very clean. Breakfast in the morning, wow!!! very Italian style with sweets and the most delicious cappucino ever! Amazing cakes every day, fresh ham and cheese, youghurts and variety of fruit, how can you not love this guy?? Michele is taking care of everything himself, so much effort put into the time spent with guests, breakfast preparation, pick up and drive to the airport at strange hours of day and night.Michele is a photographer and has amazing pictures all over his great guest house. The place itself is 2 min walk from the train station and 10 min to the center. The area is a bit sketchy if you want to hang out there by night, but why would you?For around 80 Euros per double room you have pick up at the airport, amazing breakfast, tones of tips where to go which are priceless. Thanks to Michele my newly wedded husband and myself saw the best of Italy, thanks so much Michele. He also recommended us different places to eat and stay at, things to see and wines to try.Thank you.",1,0.5089393939393939
210003316,"If youâre wondering if a stop in Reggio is worthwhile, a stay at the Pellicano for a day or two with some direction from Lorenzo should tip the balance. The Pellicano is a gem that is the heart of Reggio Di Calabria We stayed at the Pellicano mid week, mid-May 2014. Lorenzo, the owner and host was outrageously generous: with his time, willingness to share what he loves about his home.   He clearly takes pride in his B&amp;B, the town, and his ability to point guests in the right direction.  Ask him for restaurant recommendations (tell him what you like first), nearby places to visit, or where to walk through town.  Youâll get a rich and storied answer. In our case, he recommended CafÃ© Noir for apertivos â a local hotspot for an after work drinks and bites.  We were warmly welcomed by the staff and patrons alike (having to turn down drinks from a few locals for fear weâd never make it to dinner).  The bites were fantastic, and almost a dinner in and of themselves.  Baby arancini, tuna sandwiches (no crusts, thanks), fish balls, fried cheese, pizza all comes on the assorted plate.  Partake in an aperol spritz or a negroni â you wonât be alone.  Lorenzo joined us for a drink, and was so concerned we get to dinner, that he left this happening spot to walk us to our restaurant (nearly 1 km). On our last night, Lorenzo recommended his favourite âmeat restaurantâ, La Cantina del Macellaio - this did not disappoint.  The pork ragu is a must have here. Rooms were impeccably clean, tastefully furnished with a modern look and with nice extras: nespresso machine, included water and soft drinks in the mini-fridge.  Toiletries were locally supplied with deliciously scented Bergamot (Lorenzo himself is a Bergamot farmer).  If that wasnât enough, pasticceria from Bar Poker - a local shop across the street - were always freely available at reception. The king room has a charming balcony overlooking the street.Thank you Lorenzo for an amazing and memorable stay that FAR exceeded our expectations.",1,0.4899288451012589
293124879,"We visited Quebec with  family ( two kids ,13 and 12), and stayed in the Chateau Frontenac (CF)for several days.In general, our opinion is mixed.Pro: CF is a majestic beautiful building in the ideal location to explore Quebec, probably the best location in the city.Con: as far as the accommodations are concerned, I wouldnât call CF a luxury hotel, at least by USA standards.  We had the standard room with double beds . It is  basically the same room you would get in your local Days Inn for a quarter of price.  Adequate, but nothing special, with rather arthritic furniture, AC and plumbing. It is not large, big enough for two, but for family of four it felt cramped.  Our view was the inner courtyard (=none). Again, it is all acceptable when the price is appropriate-  but for USD$400 a night Iâd expect much more.  May be more expensive rooms or suites of CF are worth the money, but I am not able to comment on that.Inexplicably, CF will charge you Can$18 daily for Wi-Fi service. The room has a free wired Internet plug-in which will not fit modern laptops anyway .In my opinion, in 2015 there is no excuse for any accommodation of any class in a developed country not to provide adequate Wi-Fi, much more important for a traveler than a complementary shower cap.",0,0.4072916666666668

Be sure to book the king suites with balcony if you can with ocean view, you are on top of everything from here. Ocean Beach Hotel is the best. A really nice California courtyard as well.

Our party had two rooms adjacent in the wing nearest the Westin.  It was great because we were near the elevator to the parking garage and an exterior door which took us out beseide the Westin which had galleries and shops just a few steps away.  The Hilton is located at the extreme end of the Village but the Village is not so large that it is a problem to walk anywhere you need to go. We had room 176 and really liked the location.  Also we had a mini kitchen in our room which was really nice.  This is a good choice for a visit to Whistler in any season.  It is near the ski gondola and ziptrek.

456815247,"After reading some mixed reviews about Powder's Edge at Whistler, I took a chance and booked it, and boy am I glad I did. I'll start from the end - look at some of the photos I've attached and you'll realize just how good the location of this place is. Literally, you step outside the building and you're in front of the Whistler Gondola. It's that's close.Other than being so close to the gondola, the second good thing about this location is that it's quiet at night. The bars and restaurants are still near, but not near enough to disturb your sleep at night.So why didn't I give this place 5/5? A few things:1. Could use a refresh. Furniture feels a bit outdated but still fairly decent. We stayed at unit 905 (not sure how the other units are). 2. The master bedroom (this is a two bedroom with loft) has a noisy A/C. It comes on and off during the night and makes quite a bit of noise. If youâre a heavy sleeper, this shouldnât bother you (otherwise, use earplugs).3. The pull out sofa in the loft is uncomfortable. We were a party of 3, so 2 of us each had a bedroom and the third slept in the loft on the pull out couch. The mattress is fairly worn out and you can feel the coils in your back. 4. Dirty hallway â this isnât a big deal, but still would be nice to have the hallways cleaned.In any event, none of the above items are deal-breakers and if I do return to Whistler, this will be the first place Iâll try to book because the location is just that good. Hereâs a summary of what Powderâs Edge offers:Powderâs Edge is joined to the Hilton. You can either access your unit via Hilton lobby or direct-from-street access through stairs between the shops. Being that itâs joined to Hilton, you get access to Hilton amenities such as hot-tub, heated pool, sauna, and gym (pool towels provided by Hilton next to pool/sauna). Thereâs also underground parking (in the Hilton parking lot) which is included with the unit.Regarding the unit (unit 905):1. Two bedroom, two bathroom. Master bedroom is on second floor with attached bathroom. The loft is right outside the master bedroom.2. Full kitchen with fridge, oven, microwave, dishwasher, toaster, kettle, utensils, and dishes.3. Living room with gas fireplace4. Porch with hot-tub facing the gondola (nice and hot water)5.

The hotel was completely booked for this weekend and they were very unprepared for the large influx of people arriving. There was a long line to check in with only 1 lady working the front desk. We finally got checked in and arrived to our room only to find it a complete mess and still dirty from the previous guest. The bed was unmade with dirty towels and trash everywhere. I immediately called up to the front desk to inform them of the problem. The lady seemed frazzled and said that it was supposed to be cleaned. I was put on hold, but no one ever came back. We had to go back to the front desk and wait in the long line again before finally getting another room that was &quot;cleaner.&quot; This room was cleaned, bed made, fresh supplies, etc. However the bed comforter had some sort of mysterious reddish/brown stain on it. It was fine to stay in for the night, although we were ready to check out right away in the morning and get out of there.

First trying to navigate to the hotel was a pain , but navigating anywher re near sandiego is a pain. After finding the correct way into the lobby we were surprised how busy this hotel is. Staff was friendly at check in , like I said busy so our conversation was limited and we recieved our room key. Royal palm towers. Which is situated at the back of hotel. Entering the parking lot you have to stop at a security gate/pay stub booth. We recieved with our package free parking. But still we had to stop andpress a button get a stub then gate would open. The parking lot was big. It was a mad house in the parking lot. There is a convention center right next to the towers. We drove around the parking lot for 30 minutes along with a dozen other cars looking for a park in space. After 30 minutes we decided to go out for dinner and see if it would clear out some when we got back. Exiting the parking lot you have to provide the parking stub and pay your fee . Like I said I had free parking and stopped and dug for my parking stub which atthis ppoint was somewhere between the seats.lol. when we arrived back parking was still a hassle.

We used the hotel courtesy transfer 15 minutes from the international airport and arrived at the hotel and were greeted with a friendly smile and service by the reception staff, they were great throughout our stay, very helpful and courteous. We were allocated a lovely room on the 1st floor; the room was very spacious which came with a room safe, modern television along with a king size bed with decent pillows to choose from and a grand bathroom with walk in shower, we were also very impressed with the housekeeping staff who went the extra mile to ensure we enjoyed our stay. On our first night we dined in the hotel restaurant and tried out the taster menu which was just an amazing fine dining experience, the food was superb well presented, the chef, restaurant manager and staff were simple outstanding. Although the hotel has a Pizza Restaurant a short walk from the hotel which we tried out on the second night which was also very good, however the convenience to have the hotel restaurant on the door step after a days sight seeing was the one for us with itâs varied Italian menus and fine wine selection, all reasonable priced. The daily continental buffet breakfast is also served in this restaurant with a great choice of both warm and cold dishes to choose from.The location of this hotel was ideal for us with a frequent bus service from the hotel to Pisa Central Station was just convenient, bus tickets can be purchased from the machine at the main bus stop or from the tobacco kiosk. Once at the station go to the train information office with your list of places to visit and they will give you the train times and prices for your journeys, at the ticket office ask for an open return ticket and before you board the train make sure you VALIDAT your ticket at one of the station/platform ticket machines other wise you will have to pay a fine on the train if you donât do this. Pisa with the leaning tower is a must see, which is easily reached on foot from the station just walk along the Corso Italia across the Ponte di Mezzo and head along the Borgo Stretto to the Piazz Dei Miracoli, these streets also have some nice shops, restaurants and coffee bars. We also visited Lucca which along with San Gimignano were our favourite destinations not forgetting Siena and Florence which were all easily reached by train for a day trip. TIP, when visiting Florence take the No 12 bus just outside the station and stay on the bus to San Miniato al Monte, the views from this church are amazing, then walk down to the two coffee bars and take in the views from there before walking down to the Ponte Vesshio (20 minute down hill walk) across this famous icon you are near to the Galleria deci Uffizi, pre book your tickets in advance and then head off to Piazza della Signoria. We then walked to the Piazza del Duomo and purchased tickets to walk up the Campanile, 414 steps later, the views from the top are breathtaking. We then continued to the Basilica di Santa Maria Novella before heading back to board our return train to Pisa.",1,0.5422116402116401

They complained about the carpet, the food, the bathrooms, everything you can think of. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much from this place when we headed out on our weekend conference. But once we got there, I was happily surprised. The lady at check-in was very nice. We showed up early and didn't have our room ready (understandably), but they said they'd text us when it was available. So we headed off for lunch at the Terrace Cafe where we ordered the pepperoni pizza and split it between myself and my husband. It was very tasty and not a bad price. About 6pm, after we hadn't heard from the front desk, we wandered over to see if our room was ready. It was, but no text. (The text message finally arrived about 12am)The room was nice and clean, the bathroom was fine, and I didn't see one bug the entire trip. The hotel is fairly old, and can be a little difficult to navigate (there are buildings and paths everywhere), but for the most part, our stay was pleasant. The grounds are very nice, with rose bushes everywhere. Overall, not a bad place for a conference, and the buffet breakfast is nice..",1,0.6047222222222223

No one came to change sheets even though the âPlease changeâ sign was placed on the pillow as directed.  No one came to spray the citrus scented deodorizer to mask the smoke in my non-smoking room.When we returned late at night, the clerk apologized and explained that the housekeepers were too busy and didnât get around to our room.   Wow!  When was the last time that ever happened?   The clerk said that she would leave a note and we could speak with the manager in the morning.       In the morning. Joseph, the morning clerk had a different explanation.    He said âYou must have left the âDo Not Disturbâ sign on the door.    This was why the housekeepers did not enter the room to do their work.  I said that I had intentionally left the âDo Not Disturbâ sign on the floor of the room as I wanted the sheets and towels changed.            Joseph revised his explanation.  He said the âDo Not Disturbâ sign blew over to the front of my room from the adjacent room   Also that they tried to call the room with no answer.   He apologized for not calling my cell phone.

Also, the room we were in required us to take two elevators, that was a bit annoying but to be fair the wait for the second elevator was negligible. Great views of the city from our room and onto the St Laurence and Citadel.

Checked out the following morning and moved to a different hotel more central in Fisherman's Wharf.  Everything was clean enough though, the beds were comfortable, and the staff were helpful.

In terms of location it is ideal, about 12 minutes from Piccadilly Station and even less from Oxford Road and in an area with plenty of bars and restaurants.

207147997,"The last time I stayed at this hotel, I vowed I would never stay again, but I gave it one more shot. I have enjoyed using the spa facility on the property in the past. I booked at least a month in advance, but they still screwed up my reservation. They booked me in the wrong tower and no rooms were available in the one I requested.  They put me in a room with a door to an adjoining room and I could hear every word my neighbor's said as if they were right there in my room with me.  At 12:30 AM, I had to call the front desk because the people across the hall were partying, as if they were the only ones in the hotel!!! The sink was clogged and wouldn't drain. However, it was fixed promptly. The coffee pot still had a used coffee filter in it, so made me wonder what else wasn't clean.  Charlie's pub was very disappointing. The bar was sticky like it hadn't been cleaned in awhile.  The beer tasted watered down and flat. I had to ask for a drink, even though the bartender was right there cashing someone out. I had to get my own menus and no one came back to take our order.  We paid for the drinks and left. I got sick that night with some intestinal bug. My son made the mistake of ordering the sliders to go on another night when we got back late.  The food was cold, the fries were limp and my son said it was the worst food he had ever eaten. The breakfast buffet was terrible.  Mine was free with the room, but not worth $12 for sure.  At least I had the spa.  Think again.  The sauna was broken and there was no attendant to ask for help.  I had to walk out in the lobby in a towel. They gave me back my $25 to use the facility.  The hotel staff was great; it was the only reprieve. This place has really gone down hill.

We only stayed one night but we were treated very well.The hotel is very small (74 rooms we were told) but they manage to pack in quite a bit.  The front desk agent (I wish I could remember her name) was also there at check-out.  She was extremely friendly and welcoming and made a great impression.  We were given an upgrade due to my Inner Circle status and we quickly were on our way to our suite.  Our suite was a two room suite (bedroom and living room).  It was not a large suite based on others we have stayed in but it was well laid out with all of the amenities you would look for.  The beds were comfortable, water pressure was good in the shower (no bathtub) and there was plenty of lighting.  There were two HD TV's in the suite.Our Inner Circle amenity was brought to the room by Juli (I believe that was her name) and she was all smiles.  She managed to get all of the specifics on our profile including &quot;almond&quot; M&amp;M's, not the &quot;peanut&quot; M&amp;M's that we usually get as a replacement at Kimpton's.  We were impressed by her attention to detail!The rooftop pool and restaurant were a treat.  We ended up having breakfast at the rooftop restaurant the next morning overlooking the city and it was quite memorable.  The pool area is small but with only 74 rooms, I'm sure it was sufficient.  It was laid out very well, with areas that could double as part of the restaurant or part of the pool.Overall we have nothing but complimentary things to say.  It was a wonderful, albeit short, stay.  The service levels were high, the suite was very nice, and we really enjoyed ourselves.We would definitely recommend the Hotel Wilshire and for that matter, any Kimpton Hotel in general.  As I mentioned above, this is now our favorite Kimpton Hotel to date and keeps us interested to try other Kimpton's.",1,0.5431655328798187
61309953,"Oh dear. I have never written a review before, but I just had to do this one! When I was told this was 4 star hotel, I did not expect what we actually saw. I went with a friend for leisure and she also had to work over the weekend (on the internet). Overall, the service was appalling and the staff very unhelpful. Our experience borders on the comical.1.  Location - Point 1: First of all, the hotel is on a big main road 3 km of Pisa and the location is rather noisy and dirty, overlooking some auto repairs shops and warehouses. You have to take transport to get anywhere - a local bus or a taxi to the centre (taxi costs 12 Euro).2. Staffâs lack helpfulness â Example 1: We arrived Friday night and were given a plastic key card to our room, which we quickly found out did not work. Upon going downstairs the reception staff told us â âwe know it does not work, you need the Master key, the card is for electricity onlyâ. Any reason they did not give this to us straight away?3. The room: The room (we had a twin) was rather small (2 single beds, 2 inches away from each other) and 1 meter of space either side of the bed, with a TV, a small window, which meant that the room was very dark. It was tidy but not fantastically clean. The bathroom was nice and clean though, but could have benefitted from some space (other than minimal sink space) to put toiletries on. Everything else was very basic and rather Spartan.4. Air-con: When we got in was very hot and the air-con did not seem to be working. I called reception and was told - &quot;we know, it does not work in the entire hotel, we do not have the licence to operate the air-con yet, we are waiting&quot;. The window opens a small crack only - so not fantastic for temperature regulation!5. Wi-Fi: The hotel advertises free Wi-Fi. It is simply a lie. There is no Wi-Fi in the hotel and when my friend was no able to connect on her own, the staff were entirely unhelpful and said they did not know how my friend could log on and they would need to speak to a technical (âwho might be in later onâ), but kept insisting that they had Wi-Fi everywhere (and kept repeating âitâs free!â), but in fact the only way to get online was a single computer in the corner by the lifts. My friend was directed to use the computer in the corner, and once she has waited her turn and tried to log on, she found out that she needed log in details and password. She went back to the staff and they said âwe know, we can print that for youâ. Again â why did they not do that straight away? In the meantime my friend lost her place in the queue for the computer and had to wait to use it again.6. Food &amp; Drink: Food is another matter. Breakfast was terrible. I found out that they were serving pineapple rings which were clearly off, and I narrowly avoided eating, whilst my friend had some bad eggs and was sick for the next 24 hours. The coffee (in the metal jugs in the buffet) was cold and we asked a waitress to bring some hot coffee, she took so long making it and chatting with her colleagues on the way back that it was cold again by the time she had brought it! The next day we made sure we had food elsewhere.7. Location  - Point 2/Staffâs lack helpfulness â Example 2: On Saturday night we were out in central Pisa and at around midnight tried to get a taxi to go back to the hotel. With no taxis in the street and having waited 45 minutes at the taxi stand at the train station at Pisa Central, we called the hotel to call a taxi for us, who said they âwould try, but could not promise anythingâ. 10 minutes later they had not ordered anything and had no other ideas as to how we could get back to their hotel. In the end we were rescued by a fellow person waiting in line, who miraculously found out a taxi number and called a number of taxis to the stand.8. Staffâs lack helpfulness â Example 3: Upon arrival back at the hotel after the taxi palaver, we were given just the plastic key card to our door again (we left all keys in the hotel as not to accidentally lose them), and when we said it does not work and we that need the Master key, the person at the desk started grumbling to himself (presumably that we dared ask for it straight away) and only grudgingly gave it to us.9. Staffâs lack helpfulness â Example 4: This last one is pure comedy (but not funny at the time) â on Sunday morning there was a full-on thunderstorm. My friend wanted to buy cigarettes and after 10 minutes of trying to find out from staff where to get them, they reluctantly gave her detailed directions to the store nearby and pointed her to it (in the pouring rain, no umbrella). When she got to the store, it was shut. Once back in the hotel, my friend asked the staff â did you know it was shut before I went? And, very helpfully the staff replied â yes, youâve guessed it â âwe knewâ.OVERALL IMPRESSION:It is a good hotel for a 2 star hotel. Under no circumstances is this a 4 star hotel, there is no air-con, no wi-fi (contrary to advertisement), unhelpful staff, questionable food and not a great location. Definitely not a place for a business traveller due to Wi-Fi problems. Unfortunately due to the weather we were unable to test the pool, so I will say nothing about that. If you go with low expectations, youâll probably be fine, but do not expect a comfortable or luxurious stay.",-1,0.5071997513864983

157799246,"After a lot of trawling around trip advisor etc we elected to stay at this Hotel for 5 nights and to make our base for our first trip to Tuscany in Pisa.  The Hotel is more a B&amp;B - very clean and comfortable rooms and very quiet.  Breakfast is limited but enough to get you started for the day.   No real Bar area in the evening which would have been welcome after a day of being the tourist. TV is only Italian - which even for the Italians is not good!  Close to the rail and Bus stations to explore further afield and we found the train very easy to visit Lucca, Livorno and Florence.    WiFi as reported in many reviews is a bit fiddly as you log in via facebook!   Note for first time users that I could not get logged on at the start - then switched my mobile phone to roaming to find that I had an email from facebook telling me that my account was being accessed from a &quot;strange&quot; location and I would need to confirm all is ok via a link in the email!  Once over this glitch,  it worked fine for the rest of our stay allowing Skype, facetime etc. Getting back to the hotel,   beds very comfortable and linen very crisp and clean.   Windows shut out all noise from outside and also have electric shutters which you can close for blocking out all light and ensuring privacy.   You can hear your neighbours in the next room but that was not too loud nor a problem.  Bathroom works well - good shower.The front desk staff were courteous and very friendly.  They can recommend good restaurants,  provide tourist maps etc and advice about travel by bus or rail.  On the map the Hotel looks a long way from the hot spots for tourists but in reality it is no more than an easy 15 minute  walk from the Leaning Tower and there are many things to look at on the way.   They also have a shuttle (you have to pay) between Hotel and Airport and on check out they kindly let us leave our bags at the hotel as we had a late evening flight.If you expect the facilities of a multi national hotel chain then this hotel is not for you - however,  if you want a clean conformable hotel where the staff treat you like a welcome guest then you should consider this Hotel.

I was looking forward to our stay at the hotel as I like MacDonald hotels.From the moment we turned up I felt disappointed. I'll start with the negatives and then go onto the positives.Firstly we struggled to find the hotel, it's not easy to find. We arrived at the hotel at about 16:30 and were told our room wasn't ready. Bearing in mind that check in is at 14:00 I think this is unacceptable after a three and a half hour drive. We were given a drink in the bar and told to wait in there until our room was ready. I wasn't impressed with the bar area. It was dark and very sparse looking. I was hoping for a welcoming, relaxing bar area and it wasn't. We were there for 45 minutes and no one had come over to us. I went and enquired at reception and thankfully our room was ready. I don't know why someone couldn't have come and told us it was ready. The only other real negative was the service later in the evening. We ran down to reception and then room service asking for some tea/coffee cups. We were told on both occasions that they'd be brought up to our room but they never arrived. These are little things that could have easily not happened and would have made our stay more enjoyable.On the positive side the room we had was pretty good. Nice comfy bed with a flat screen tv with all the freeview tv channels. The bathroom again was pretty good with a decent (although not powerful) shower and lovely warm towel rail.I must add that I emailed the hotel just to pass on my thoughts and the manager replied the next day apologising.

169243459,"We stayed here last night while visiting the Truman Library and Home.  We are on a road trip to the midwest to visit family.  The hotel was hard to find as it was off the main street and behind some other businesses.  The lady that checked us in and a different lady that checked us out were both very friendly and willing to make our stay successful.  The room was on the ground floor which meant it was partially underground in like a half basement which we have run into before at other Super 8s.  The bed was comfortable and we found the room clean.  It did have a light smell when we got there so we turned the fan on and opened the window.  We did not eat breakfast here but it was the usual Super 8 breakfast (cereal, small doughnuts, etc).  This was not the worst Super 8 or hotel I have ever been in and certainly not the best Super 8.  It was good for one night and only one night.  Like all the Super 8s we have been in, it did not have an elevator.",0,0.5727072310405643
253729006,"The Roomzzz apartments are built into an old bank building and go up to 5 floors. The apartment we had for 3 nights on the second floor was well designed and fitted out quite luxuriously for the price. Its 3 large windows and high ceiling gave it an airy feel with views over the busy Princess St. The windows are all double glazed with secondary glazing as well to reduce street noise, which is effective for all but the noisiest of boy racers or emergency vehicles. Wax ear plugs recommended! The bathroom was excellent with huge bath, separate rainfall shower and ample wash basin set in a granite work top. The fully equipped dining  kitchen was more than sufficient for our needs. The bed was large and comfortable with ample space around and wall mounted tv opposite. A small settee with coffee table completed the lounge area. The only minor draw back was a creaky, raised floor  in the bed and lounge area.We were never disturbed by other guests from above or below. The desk staff were most helpful. They let us in early at check in for no extra cost because it was cold, and they stored our bags securely after check out until we collected them to go to the station enabling us to fully enjoy our last morning. The grab and go breakfast was croissant, fruit juice, fruit and coffee. Simple but adequate. We grabbed and went back to bed! One of the best things about this base is its siting on the edge of china town, near the science museum, peoples history museum, art gallery, city center, a stones throw from the tram route to Salford Quays and surrounded by good pubs and good value restaurants. There are many other hotels nearby but I doubt they offer the facilities and great value of roomzzz. Highly recommended",1,0.431567944250871

The rooms are a little old and tired, but I slept very well in a comfortable bed which was the main thing. Breakfast the next morning was a bit of a nightmare though. It was understaffed and the people actually working were running around like crazy trying to clear tables and seat people.

The concierges were very helpful and were knowledgeable, not only about Quebec City, but about the entire province. The hotel was very esthetically pleasing.

The architects and decorators embraced these treasures and incorporated them into the dÃ©cor, beautifully bridging the gap between the old and the new. Our room was large and bright.

The room was very comfortable and quiet, even though the hotel was full of families with children which I'm sure weren't always quiet.  The only downside to the room was that it was a non-smoking room but it smelled of smoke.  I actually noticed another non-smoking room as I was walking down a hallway that was being use as a gathering spot for a group of people.  The door was left open and cigarette smoke was coming from the room.  This seems to be something that they could pay more attention to and enforce a  little better.  Non smokers do not appreciate a smokey room.  The swimming pool was quite nice.   The water was warm and the pool was a good size for a hotel.

Right outside the room was a small &quot;dining room&quot; table and chairs set up--I did my work on a computer there.

I also saw him mowing the yard--so he wears many hats! Alan (owner 2) was there to help with breakfast and for a few words of conversation, too. I did not have a dog with me, but 3 others who were staying at the same time I was (we were attending the same local seminar) had dogs with them, and the house was still quiet.Both owners have created a welcoming, comfortable, well-decorated house with relaxing vistas and seating to enjoy the country even though the 403 is visible in the distance.

Beautiful grounds (but be prepared that the hotel is a little isolated, so you can't just step outside for things you might want). Tasty food on site for bar snacks, in the restaurant, or catered.

118164577,"We stayed in L'Auberge Saint Antoine for a few days in August 2011, and couldn't have been more satisfied with the experience. The hotel is absolutely gorgeous -- decorated with hip-but-not-overpowering inspiration from the nearby Musee de La Civilisation -- and the staff were extremely courteous and friendly. All the rooms are spacious, the bathrooms are super modern (tvs in bathrooms!? love it!!), and the beds are impeccably comfortable. Although it would have been perfect for a couple looking for a romantic stay, I was there with my parents and sister and didn't feel at all out of place. The hotel's restaurant, Panache, is perfect for a special occasion dinner, and the staff's responsiveness to my (very severe) food allergy was impeccable. The hotel's location -- right at the bottom of Lower Town -- is perfect if you're the type of traveller that likes to stroll and explore. It's more of a walk to the Hotel Frontenac/Upper Town, but certainly doable. Saint-Antoine is right on the water, which can also make for great walks. Absolutely surrounded by excellent food options, too! The hotel feels like much more of a splurge than it is -- certainly, the prices aren't cheap, but you're surrounded by such unpretentious luxury that it's really worth it if you're looking for something superlative.",1,0.643185550082102

The carpet was sticky, and the sheets were full of holes. The bathtub looked like someone took a blowtorch to a corner. The carpet in the halls is in a severe need of cleaning.

8246009,"This was a nice place -- about 20 years ago.  There was a permanent musty odor in the elevators and hallways of the tower in which I stayed.  The climate controls in the rooms are apparently there solely for the purpose of keeping the occupant distracted.  No matter what thermostat setting you choose, you get a humid 75 degrees of something blowing out the vent.The grounds are huge and there are a number of swimming pools and restaurants on the property.  The overall effect of the outdoor setting is actually charming.  Unfortunately, there are no consumer alternatives within walking distance:  i.e. no convenience markets or family restaurants to visit.  Without a car, you are stuck entirely at the mercy of the establishment.  It's like being trapped in Disneyland without the rides.  Every beverage costs you an hour's pay.  The restaurant portions were both skimpy and expensive.  A club sandwhich, which consisted of four corners that appeared to have been snatched off of an hors d'oeuvres tray, was about $11 at one of the &quot;casual&quot; restaurants.In the way of toiletries, your room comes only with soap, body lotion and shampoo.  In order to expedite my way through airport security, I decided to buy toothpaste, mouthwash and deodorant at my destination.  That was a mistake.  When I stayed at the Hampton Inn in Stockton, the room included a basket containing mouthwash, deodorant, shaving cream, shampoo, a razor and a comb.  The Town and Country had just such a package for sale in their gift shop -- for twelve bucks!Many places have free high-speed internet access.  Not so at this place.  Their WiFi costs you $2.95 and hour or $9.95 per day.

The first night we got there it was around 10:30 or 11pm, and after driving the scenic route down highway 101 it had been a long day. We decided to take our boys (ages 11 and 20 months) down to the beach to let them (and my husband and I) blow off some steam. What we found were about 10-15 different bonfires on the beach with about 10-20 people surrounding each one. It was very cool, and everyone was very respectful. We went back to our second floor room, and went right to sleep!The inn accepts travelers with pets, so those people get the first floor (tile on the floor in those rooms). Since we did not bring our pugs this trip we were put on the second floor. The room was just what we needed: a mini kitchen with a fridge and microwave; 2 queen size beds; a full size futon; a separate room with sink; shower/tub, toilet; and closet; and best of all a great private balcony with a view of the beach and ocean!The inn itself has kind of a sixties Rat Pack feel, but it is not dumpy by any means. It has a nice pool, beautiful cactus garden, and palm trees galore. The staff was friendly and appeared to be surfers who worked there to support their surfing habit. The continental breakfast is decent but not indulgent--but the best part is that is included in the price of the room.The location is great for families, travelers with pets, or couples with its close access to the people beach, dog beach, skate park, Sea World, and all of the sites that San Diego has to offer.

I stayed in one of the rooms in the single story section of this complex.  The room was nice but the TV and reception were not as nice as I would have expected.  I guess you donât go to San Diego to watch TV though.  I would have liked to have seen one of the rooms in the Royal Palm Tower on-site though.  I imagine they would have been a little nicer, albeit a little pricier also.  On-site I ate at Trellises Garden Grille, Kellyâs Steakhouse, and the Terrace CafÃ© &amp; Deli. I also stopped in one evening at Charlieâs (a sports bar on-site) to relax and have a few drinks.  The gentleman who managed Charlies (Iâm sorry his name escapes me right now) was an extremely nice guy.  I had a very pleasant time while there.  Pati M. was one of the waiters/waitresses that was at the Trellises Garden Grille and she provided very nice service.  They had excellent (also a little pricey though) breakfasts.

An efficient staff provided helpful, friendly service. In addition, the hotel houses a truly first-class Italian restaurant, Il Matto. We liked it so much the first night we were in Quebec, we dined there the next evening too.One note about the bed: It sits atop an attractive wooden platform. But that platform extends several inches further than the mattress, leaving a hard edge sticking out into the room at shin level.  A number of other reviewers commented on this, and the hotel's management appears to have responded by adding motion-activated night-lights under the bed frame. To be sure, we pulled the mattress down to the end of the platform, leaving no protruding edge to worry about. Notwithstanding this one nit, we highly recommend Hotel 71.

I called because my sink drain had a horrible smell coming from it and didn't drain properly and only one set of lights in my bathroom were functioning. (lights above and below mirror - only my lower ones worked) In addition there was no magnifying mirror in the bathroom (as was pictured on line). When I returned from work the only thing that had changed was the lights were fixed. I was given a magnifying mirror that wouldn't turn on and my drain hadn't been addressed at all.

After checking in, we had some coffee and then left to see the city. When we returned, the coffee cups were replaced with fresh ones - a simple gesture but shows attention to detail.

Quiet rooms.  It is named &quot;Airport Plaza&quot; but it is really not next to the airport and about 10 minutes away which is a good thing, as I did not want to be in proximity to the noise. I missed the complimentary breakfast buffet but there is a restaruant across the street (Bill's Cafe) which serves great food. Pleasant registrastion staff.

The flat screen HDTV, the media connection console, the cool bathroom sink, the newness of it all was very seductive.  But the love affair did not last. First, I noticed the sink drained very slowly.  Well, can't let a little thing like that get in the way of love.  I took a shower, and noticed the screws attaching the holder to the tile wall were starting to rust already.  Some were missing caps.  I used the toilet, and noticed the seat was the cheap thin plastic kind.  I started to wonder... is the honeymoon already over?  How long will the renovation last?As the night wore on, I realized this love affair cannot go on.  I started to hear my neighbors talking.  Yes, I could hear their conversations.  Not a good sign.  At around 10PM, my adjacent neighbors in room 915 were in the mood for, shall I say, romance.  Without getting into details, let me just say that I could hear EVERYTHING!  Later, my other neighbors in room 919.... well, you get the point.In the end, this was a one night stand for me.  I need much more than a pretty face for a lasting relationship.

When I arrived this time the notes were in the screen and we were put in the back which was quite peaceful.  Since I originally came here in 2002 they have updated quite a bit and they keep it in good shape. The staff is quite helpful and they have a free transport service that takes you to several places including the San Diego Zoo and Old Town San Diego.  We went to both of these places with the driver Jeff who was a sheer delight.  He was pleasant, helpful and punctual.  When we used him after helping the economy by our shopping he went out of his way and drove us to where we had parked so transferring our merchandise was easy.  My only problem was in the dining.  Dinner one evening was okay except that the waiter was bordering on rude and quite inattentive.  The next morning we ate breakfast there also and it was one of the worst experiences.  Two of us ordered the French toast with bananas.  Mine was awful, uncooked and had no banana so I sent it back. Then I ordered their special sweet potato waffle with cinnamon.  When it arrived it was a plain ordinary waffle.  I had to send that back also.  When it came back again, I think they just flipped it on the plate because it was still a &quot;plain&quot; waffle and my sister, who ordered the same thing, received a plain waffle as well.  She kept hers -  I once again had mine sent back and decided to just have rye toast. Needless to say, it took forever to get through breakfast and while I did not blame the waiter I felt that someone was not doing their job.  Not sure I would dine there in the future.

453480216,"We just ended our 25th anniversary stay after spending our 1st at this wonderful &quot;Grande Dame&quot; hotel over 2 decades ago.  We were there 5 nights and the hotel impressed us from the start by nicely recognizing our occasion with a special treat in our room and all the staff made us feel very special throughout our stay.Simply outstanding services at:  Reception, concierge (Diana), bell services (Michel) Housekeeping (Alouise) and all the valet across the board.  (But this is to be expected from any Fairmont property I think- yes?)Our room was awesome:  Large and perfectly appointed with high quality linens, bedding and top of the line boutique amenities.   An awesome unused looking Keurig with Plenty of coffees and an outstanding tea selection, multiple outlets, and power strips for all the chargers and accessories you can bring! One major mention from our travel perspective- the shower pressure and head (even more important to me than the bed) was outstanding - a 12 on a scale of 1-10- (in fact the shower head was the same as what we have in all our bathrooms at home!)Gym is fantastic!  State of the art equipment and every machine imaginable in a spotless, hip looking space.  The pool was overrun with children most of the time during our stay - so we didn't swim/ rather just worked out in the gym- but in fairness to the kids the high temperature during our entire stay never exceeded 8 degrees Fahrenheit - so can you blame them- they deserve some fun too!The downsides to our room:  1)  We did not have bathrobes the first couple of days and after seeing all the guests walking around with them we requested and received two immediately (although we didn't use them after all/ very course fabric- literally like sandpaper- time to toss these two I think).  2)  There was very limited shelf/storage for unpacking (just two night stands with two small drawers each, very small closet single door (maybe only 1 meter wide max), that's it for clothes etc!   (given the brutal cold weather of course we had tons of clothing so the space was a little awkward) .  3)  There were no mirrors whatsoever anywhere, other than the bathroom mirror which of course steams up, and in this case very much so, as the bathroom is one of smallest I've seen- and there is absolutely no room for two people simultaneously- so a little tight - but a great tub for bathing and that's the Mrs' priority!Finally- it was football playoff Sunday and we bought a large variety of cheeses, pates, charcuterie and wines to enjoy in the room on Sunday evening during the packers/Dallas game only to realize there was no fridge or micro in the room- no worries we went old school like we do when in French wine country and put everything out on the window ledge- lol!  1608 was great- amazing cheeses, great complimenting wines, and a very cool atmosphere- perfect for a lazy night in.  And while we did not dine in Champlains (the renovation since the last time we dined there about 8-9 years ago, looks great and the restaurant no doubt is excellent (we just chose to dine in the many highly regarded restaurants in the area).CF is definitely targeting the younger discriminating demographic and doing it very well- this is not the same old staid kind of property that rests on the laurels of the past - respect for tradition is evident, but so to is respect for the ever change needs of today's traveler.Now having said all the above it is important to mention that we booked this through third party and got a ridiculously low rate- honestly we could've paid double per night and still would've been thrilled overall.

At the last minute I found this location and was thrilled with the photos. The location does look as good as advertised and was close to where I needed to be. The rooms were beautiful, well maintained, and clean. Unfortunately, every time I needed some service it was horrible or non-existent. I had traveled all day and wanted something to eat and drink. I went to the bar and had a seat but there wasn't a bar tender. I sat down in the corner and proceeded to read. As I looked up later on the bar tender was there but he was watching TV and never made any rounds or offer of service. As I got up he disappeared again. So I went out to the courtyard where others were eating, but I could never get the waiters attention. So after 20 minutes I started to leave and ran into the waiter. I asked him where I could have a meal. He asked me to sit down and he would be back. After 10 minutes he returned and I ordered food and a cocktail. After another 10 minutes he returned and asked if I could move into the bar to order my cocktail and food. Which I did and was finally able to order. The food was fantastic and they accommodated a few of my special requests nicely. The next morning some friends dropped by my room and I ordered room service for 4 people. The wait was not long and the food was fantastic, but they only brought silverware for 2. I called immediately and asked if they could send 2 more place settings, but they never arrived.

The room itself was great with a very comfortable bed and a nice rain shower head. The mountain view they promised with my booking was laughable considering the mountains in the area. We were mostly looking at trees with a side view of a small mountain. I also booked a Club room believing we were to have special access to a lounge room that provided snacks and drinks, but we were told that service was just taken away recently! So if you read the previous review that says wonderful things about the Club room snacks and breakfast, forget it! All they give you is free water and a couple of cheap chocolates that are coffee flavoured.Then there is the dining, we looked at all the options, the steakhouse in our building has a beautiful setting, but the menu is super expensive. There are a couple pubs which appear to have some good choices, but we wanted a dining experience. That left us with a small Italian place or the main dining room, called the Fireweed Grill. This used to be a really nice dining room, but has become nothing more than a very casual dining experience. We were surrounded by noisy children and the drinks and food were nothing to get excited about, just average. They at least had a nice view of the mountains.The pool and hot tub area was okay, but it could use some renovations.

It's appropriate then that Hotel Terrasse Dufferin feels very much like one of the tiny European hotels I've stayed in.What you get for your money here is value and optimal location. It's steps away from the boardwalk. The view is spectacular. It's reasonably clean and you don't have a lot of street noise. And again it's cheap. The two managers were very nice.Like those tiny European hotels I mentioned, there are some sacrifices. There's no elevator (and in a city where you're up or down a hill every time you move, that might be an issue at the end of your day). Our room came with A/C in the sense that there is centrally controlled A/C. It's an older building, so you hear noises from the other rooms. Also, the floor of our room literally sloped. The bathroom was large, but not well designed. The shower is tiny. There's a continental breakfast, but we never ordered it so I can't speak to its quality or value. We did park are car, which entailed leaving the keys with the manager. In theory, there is wifi, but it was useless (not sure if it was any better in the breakfast room, but it almost never worked in our own room).For us, those were minor inconveniences. The Fairmont is next door and I'm guessing the rooms there would be four times the cost. It's nice to stay in a well-appointed hotel, but it's not always necessary.Other reviews mentioned the housekeeping and I have to say I noticed the same thing.

Anne's uses sustainable practices both in their restaurant (by sourcing their own meats, fruits, herbs, and vegetables whenever possible) and in their laundering.

I do have to levy some criticisms on the hotel but they shouldnt stop anyone from booking - as it is genuinely a good value place to stay. First up - they let themselves down on some of the smallest things - but they need to remember - the smallest things are the things that stick in your head the most when you leave. Such things as no mousemat for the imac - you cant use the mouse on a glass table properly without a mat. Dirty cutlery in drawers - wayyyyyyy too many lightswitches - poor heating system and stairs that squeak wayyyyyy to much. Now to the goo dbits, the place is very nice, comfortable with good staff and good value for money. Facilities are excellent wit the TVs everywhere and the iMac etc. Nice kitchen and big leather couches.Room 508 we were in if anyones interested and I would recommend paying teh extra to upgrade to it.

The negatives: our room wasn't large so a longer stay wouldn't have been so good, and yes it has seen better days - but it is by no means bad, just a little tired.

We initially booked a suite in the Mount Kidd Manor, but my mother refused to stay in the suite and after seeing rooms in the rest of the hotel, I agreed with her.  The initial rooms of the suite were small, drab, with beat up furniture.  I felt like I was staying in a budget motel.  There was tape keeping the carpet together in the hallway in multiple locations.  On complaining to the management, we were told they were going to be renovating the building next year...  Not really very much help to us and certainly not worth the money they attempted to charge us.  Luckily, there was enough availability that we were able to switch to two separate rooms in the main building, but the additional cost was more than $100/night with no compensation from management.    Not very impressed.The rest of the hotel buildings were in better condition, although I think the 4 star rating is still a stretch.  Rooms were very hot with no functioning temperature control.  No coffee in the lobby in the mornings.  Food options were quite expensive for the quality.  We decided to drive 80 min round trip into Canmore on our second dinner and breakfast rather than pay for what was available at the hotel.On the plus side, most of the service from the staff was stellar.

The hotel itself is fine, however, because the owner seemed to want to practice his english with us, when we were having our breakfast he spent the entire time watching us and bombarding us with information. It was OK in the beginning because he was just getting everything ready (the table was groaning with the amount of food he put on it!) for us to eat but once the food was on the table he insisted on standing to watch us eat all the food he'd put on the table; he also claimed that it was &quot;all natural&quot; food despite the fact that we were opening packet after packet!! That made us laugh. He claimed that his mother made all the jams, and even the chocolate spread but later on in the day we saw the same jars in the shops available for sale! The surrounding area (or should I say the whole of Reggio di Calabria) was disgusting and we were really disappointed at how dirty and filthy the area was. It wasn't that our hotel was in a particularly bad area, it was just that all of the Calabria part that we were in was really disgusting and we eventually cut our time there short and went onto the next part of our holiday in Rome. Although I'd recommend the hotel, due to the area I wouldn't recommend it. There are only 4 rooms in this hotel and the owner is nowhere to be found during the day. If you want anything you have to call him though he will generally come over to deal with any issues.",0,0.4905002405002405

You can watch the surfers and all the action on the beach from your room, even from your bed.  You can hear the ocean as well as all the action in Ocean Beach and some airplanes.  We could walk the surf beach, swim beach and dog beach steps from our door in one direction and the pier in the other direction and then climb on the cliffs and watch the waves crash in past the pier.  Everything is close to this hotel.  Great restaurants, bike rentals, surf rentals, yoga, smoothie/coffee shops with a block or two.  Ocean Beach is affordable and fun!  The people watching is fantastic.  Our room was was very clean, comfortable and secure with an amazing view and plenty of character.  We had plenty of hot water and good water pressure in the shower.  The room had a very nice small refrigerator with a good sized freezer and a microwave.

255786664,Stayed here for two night with breakfast.  Overall not a bad stay.  Location is good and if you coming by train is walkable but may be wise to get a taxi. I saw many car parks near by too Remember this is a city centre hotel so expect noise from traffic and near by bars. I slept well so I can't complain. Check in was not bad but felt for the poor lad on this own behind the desk as it did start getting busy when I checked in. Maybe another member of staff would have helped him but again I didn't have to wait long. Room itself was not bad size for a city centre hotel.  I would say the walls need a refresh as there was a few marks and small hole by the bedside table. The bathroom was a nice size and powerful shower but one light was out which needed replacing has it made it dark. Windows do need to be cleaned! Most of the staff where very good expect the housekeeping team when on day of checkout I had a knock on the door at 10:15am asking when i am going to leave while she was looking at her watch.  Mmm not the greatest customer care seeing check out was 11am!Breakfast was hot and nice and didn't have to wait.Overall not a bad stay with some attention to detail points which would make this a very good hotel. ,1,0.6287654320987655

There are stores nearby to purchase what you need, but it was a bit surprising having to scramble for what seems like basic provisions.  Also, the bathroom is very tiny.  I would not recommend this Single Room to a person of size.  I had to turn sideways to enter the bathroom, or be blocked by my shoulders.  The shower stall is dark and small.  You could hit your head on the sink if you fell asleep on the toilet, they're that close together.  For the record, I'm 5'1&quot; and had to stand on my toes to see my face in the mirror.5. No &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; signs.  Some days, I don't need the room serviced but there's no way to let them know until they walk up 19 steps and knock on your door.6. Worst of all was the wifi.  There were two routers you could sign into, but neither of them had a decent signal.  I tried on a tablet and a laptop, and was sadly disappointed with the lack of connectivity.  This was the only way I could contact my family to let them know I was ok, and it didn't work 80% of the time.  Don't advertise free wifi if it doesn't work well, please.I knew it was a small room to start with, so I'm really not complaining about the size.  Just mentioning it for potential future travelers who might not fit well with this room.Good points?  Location, mostly.  3 blocks away from Verti Marte, 3 blocks away from Rouses grocery.  The room does have a good mini fridge for storing leftovers.  The coffee they provide is delicious, the coffee maker could be updated a bit.  Good cable tv, expanded basic with music channels.  Great air conditioning.  Comfortable bed.  Wallpaper is a bit dated, but it's a guest house so I didn't mind much.  It is not sound proof, take that into consideration if noise bothers you,  You can hear all the noise in the street all day and night. In summary, this room would be better suited to a shorter stay.  12 nights of the Single Room was a bit too much for me.  If the wifi worked better, it wouldn't have felt as long.  Please fix the wifi, your guests would greatly appreciate it!  I'm including many photos, so the next person will have a better understanding of what they're buying.</span><span class=""taLnk ulBlueLinks moreBtn"" onclick=""widgetEvCall('handlers.clickExpand', event, this);"">More</span>",1,0.5504109977324263

Our multi day stay at a convention was disrupted by noise multiple times and left us exhausted.On the other side of the coin....just across the street is a high end mall with both good food and a Tesla outlet along with a good selection of high fashion stores.  Transportation both in the form of the bus and the tram are easily a quick walk from the resort. The front staff was excellent especially my conversation with Elizabeth who took the time to really give me the lay of the land both in terms of the hotel as well as navigating the city.The meals at the convention center were average, with arrangements for vegetarians available, but nothing to rave about. If your with a large group, we were, the pool areas and general size of the facility works. Our group was able to fully utilize the conference areas which overall were well suited for the talks. The conference rooms were quiet and generally, although not 100% of the time, the AV equipment really did the job. Party rooms are on the first floor of the towers, so consider that with your plans if a group stay is also in the cards, at the same time.Some food issues to consider. For breakfast if your fare is egg based your ok, otherwise it's limited to the simple carbs of bagels/toast/danish type of products. The rooms do have a fridge and trader joes is accessible.

39002924,"I stayed at the Town and Country for four nights in August for a business conference that was taking place at the convention center on the property.  This is a really odd hotel and I'm not quite sure what type of traveler it is built for.  Its not in an ideal location to be a relaxing resort, its not nice enough to be a good conference center, and its too expensive to be a budget hotel.  First of all you have the location, on I-8 just east of I-5.  While you're within a short drive of most of the San Diego area, you aren't really anywhere of interest.  You're not downtown, not by the ocean, just kind of out among lots of other hotels.The property is large and spread out.  Upon first look, it appears to be something out of 1960's Florida.  There are several buildings and each contains different types of rooms.  I stayed in the tower, which is at the back end (north end) of the property.  It's about eight levels and has exterior corridors.  Almost all rooms have a view of the pool below.  The room I received was damp and dank, even with the air conditioner running all day.  While it wasn't noticeably dirty, everything seemed to be sticky and there was a musty smell to the room.  The bed was a murphy bed (pulled down from the wall).  The TV cabinet doors would not stay open unless propped.  There was a door that joined with the room next door that was paper thin and didn't even reach the floor.  I could hear the slightest noise from the room next door, including every time the water was turned on and every footstep on the floor.  Fortunately my neighbor was another business traveler, so there wasn't much noise from the room.  After speaking with others who were staying in some of the other buildings on the property, it seems the tower offers the largest rooms.  My room had a wet bar and mini-fridge as well as a couch and dining table.  Rooms in the other buildings apparently did not have these amenities.  The tower rooms also have a balcony.Even at the discounted conference rate, this hotel was no deal.  Add on a $14 per day parking fee (no reason for it given the location) and a charge for internet, and this hotel is no value whatsoever.  I was able to get around the internet fee by connecting to the wireless signal from the cafe below my room.  For some reason that access was free and the signal was even stronger than the regular hotel signal.There are some aspects of the resort that were acceptable.  The grounds are nice to stroll around (although it's easy to get lost or turned around).  There are trees and rose gardens everywhere.  There are also a couple pools that looked well maintained.  The staff at the convention center was excellent.  Fast and attentive.  There is also a large shopping mall just north of the property, just across a small river and a street.  There are plenty of dining options within the resort as well as a few at the mall, all within easy walking distance.  But those aspects don't make up for the drawbacks or the high price.  One colleague of mine said she saw a rat on the property one morning.  Another checked out upon arrival when his room smelled so bad he couldn't stand it.  I didn't find anything so awful I felt I needed to leave, but I certainly won't be returning here.",-1,0.4975151428092604

On Friday they had graduation at the convention center. We went out for dinner and come back to a mess in the parking lot. We told parking attendant that we are hotel guests and were told there were no special spots for us. We had to park far away from our room.

The guy in the cafe by the pool( forgot his name) was wonderful. He saw that I had my baby in my arms and offered to pour my coffee. Even made sure to call in for fresh towels for the spa area.

The hotel is about a mile from Disneyland and the convention center, but is reight beside Angels Stadium and has some decent restaurants within walking distance. The biggest issue I had with the hotel is the noise from the trains passing by as the rail line is directly behind the hotel. The temperature was very comfortable in the evening so we left the windows open, big mistake. I was awakened at 4.30am by a train going through with its horn blaring, if you've seen My Cousin Vinnie it was pretty much like that. Having traveled from the east coast I was then wide awake.

I've stayed in the 2 bedroom suite, king bedroom and junior suite. All have been great. No, it's not 'high luxury', but the hotel is consistently superior quality to most other properties that get trashed in Whistler. The parking is easy, typical hotel parking rates. if you don't like it, go park in the main lot. But you take the risk of your car's security. Every hotel charges a lot for parking, so don't say they're 'too expensive'.I'm also a Hilton honors member and often get upgrades, free wifi, etc. It's nothing exceptional, but still a good standard quality you can count on. The only low point for this property is that the pool isn't the best. The location and view is nice, but the hot tub is pretty small and it can get crowded.Typically an older demographic stays here, so don't go expecting mad pool parties.

On the ground floor thou, you cannot expect any view. No kettle and tea available in the room, which I find as a disadvantage.

Owner Sergio was the perfect host, helpful and quick to respond to emails when we booked from Canada, warm and welcoming when we arrived from the nearby train station, and available to give advice about sights and, even more importantly, good restaurants.  We happily followed his guidance regarding ice cream, pizza  and restaurants cooking local specialties and enjoyed delicious food.  Both our prettily decorated bedroom and the ensuite bathroom (our room actually did have a large bathtub!) were a good size. We were located at the back of the building, so it was very quiet.  Casa Blanca is a comfortable, secure place to stay, in a good location for the train station, main shopping street and the lovely lungomare, a promenade along the sea which was quite glorious when we were there.  The sea was lovely, the sky blue and the view of Sicily was enticing.  However, what impressed us the most about Casa Blanca was Sergio himself.  He is young, enthusiastic and quick to offer assistance, from carrying luggage to booking our transport to the ferry terminal.  He even telephoned Messina to confirm our car rental reservation on our behalf, which we much appreciated because our Italian is limited.  His pride of ownership shines through.

The owner seemed nice and spoke a little bit of English, and it was a rainy summer evening, so we decided to take our chances on the basement room offered. Big mistake. The ceilings are about 68 inches so we both fit, and the room was cramped with poor light, but we are from NYC so we can deal with a less than ideal living space for one night-- as long as it is clean. There is a garden outside the window, and within an hour of arriving, we noticed bugs all over the carpet. They were something between roaches and ants, and probably harmless and had come in because of the torrential rain, but we went upstairs and got the manager. He understood some of what we said and came down to look-- agreeing that there were bugs and killing some of them with his keys, then putting the keys in the door. We asked for a different room at the same price, and he said he'd be happy to refund our money if we decided to leave (we'd only been there an hour!) but he would not give us another room and asked we please make a decision quickly. We walked around in the rain for over an hour looking for another place that was still open and we could afford that would take us and have parking for our rental car. We luckily found a beautiful room a couple blocks away, though it was more expensive, but the whole experience was very uncomfortable and a waste of time, and we were very wet by the time of evening we finally found something.",-1,0.537375478927203

189942474,"I just booked my third visit to Ste. Anne's Spa.  I have stayed at Ste. Anne's overnight with friends and can't imagine any spa could provide a better experience.  Our cottage had lovely views of the water, the rooms were spacious, comfortable, cozy and well appointed in every way.  A lovely balcony let us enjoy a glass of wine in the evening outdoors and the fireplace in my room was just perfect.  The cottage had a very large shared space that had a kitchen, living room, t.v. and a hot tub just outside. Lunch was incredible, with exquisite tasting food that is beautifully prepared, presented and served. The dining room is lovely and has amazing views.  Afternoon tea can only be described as decadent.  Where else can you enjoy spectacular views, fantastic food, and such excellent service in a bathrobe while in such a relaxed state?  The spa services are fabulous and in my 3 visits have enjoyed various massages that exceeded my expectations, a vichy shower, fitness class and more.  Ste. Anne's is ahhhhhmazing.

The bed was so comfortable that you didn't want to get out of it and ditto with the shower/tub combination.  The room was a nice size and had state of the art amenities.  There were a few small 'dropped the ball' moments like it taking over half an hour for our luggage to arrive at our room, requesting a luggage rack we never received and running out of facial tissues the evening before departure.  It's certainly not much to complain about but when you're paying these prices to stay in this quality of a hotel, nothing should be overlooked.  Otherwise, we highly recommend this hotel.",1,0.4915151515151515
228156768,"We chose this hotel on the basis of other excellent reviews and have not been disappointed at all. I would like to be able to award 4.5 stars. At first glance, the location seems wrong - the hotel is south of the river, and all the 'sights' are north of the river, the Field of Miracles with the Tower etc very much so. However, it is only about a 25 minute walk to the Tower and Cathedral and that is through the streets and shops/cafes of the old town, which is interesting in its own right. The hotel gains from being away from the crowds around the Field of Miracles, and also gains massively through being a less than ten minutes walk to the railway station, which we used both to take a day trip to Lucca which is an attractive walled town half an hour's train journey to the north of Pisa, and also to continue our holiday by taking the train to Florence. The airport is also to the south, and we walked to the hotel after arriving with Ryanair from Bournemouth. It took us only about 20-25 minutes (we are in our 60s) pulling two wheeled cabin bags behind us. Like the rest of Pisa, the walk was on flat ground. As far as the hotel goes, we had a good sized room on the ground floor with a large and well-equipped bathroom, with replenished toiletries. The shower cubicle is a little small, but perfectly manageable. The bed was comfortable, as the mattresses were firm which suited me, but not my wife quite as much. There are spare pillows and blankets if needed, but we had no need of them. There was a safe, a television, and a mini-bar (reasonable prices) in the room, and free wifi. The weather was quite hot for most of our stay so we were very appreciative of the air conditioning. Our room had shutters as well as curtains, so we heard very little noise from outside. The owners were very welcoming and attentive, as other people have said. The continental breakfasts were plentiful and of a good standard. Like other guests, we ate in the pleasant courtyard area, except for the one morning when there had been heavy rain the previous night. Do not be fooled by the outside look of the hotel - the inside is very attractive, with high quality furniture and paintings etc. There is a very pleasant lounge area, and the owners are happy to bring drinks if you choose to sit there. The room keys are heavy (with hair just like Sideshow Bob's from the Simpsons!) but as there is someone at reception 24/7 it is very practical to leave the key in the hotel. Altogether, if we ever return to Pisa, we will be more than happy to stay again at this hotel.",1,0.5873086734693879

We checked in on a Thursday and had very friendly service from the front desk staff. Our room was clean, nicely decorated and the two queen sized beds were very comfortable for everyone in our party.We ate breakfast each day at the bistro and it was wonderful- very tasty and, again, great service. The front desk staff was very knowledgeable about area attractions and helpful with suggestions for restaurants and directions. They even provided us with a sheet of paper that listed directions, addresses and phone numbers for area points of interest. Housekeeping was great- the room was always clean when we came back from our daily adventures and any requests (extra towels) were filled promptly and with a smile.My daughter and aunt used the pool and loved it- the pool area is very nice, clean and relaxing. I utilized the on site laundry facility and found it to also be clean and reasonably priced.We found the location of Hotel Circle to be extremely easy access- you just hop on and hop off the highway to get anywhere- we found very easy and quick access to everything we were looking for- Sea World, the SD Zoo, Gas lamp District, Old Town, Mission Beach and Sea Port Village. Every place that we wanted to visit was quickly accessible and within a 10-15 minute drive from this centrally located hotel. The parking fee of $16 is clearly spelled out on the hotel's website, so I don't really understand why it is an issue for other patrons... we went to the hotel knowing full well what to expect. The parking lot was safe, clean and provided easy access to the rooms with keyed access.Thank you Courtyard Marriott Mission Valley for an exceptional stay, friendly service and your clean, well appointed hotel.

286780530,"We booked a room for 4 and it came with a cosy private verandah (overlooking an indoor courtyard) for chilling out or having breakfast. Breakfast was continental. No eggs, meat or cheese. The room had airconditioning which was important with the hot summer weather. It wasn't as cool as we would have liked, but at least it made the heat more bearable. The bathroom window also had insect screens, which is essential since mozzies abound in summer. Luca was a wonderful host, helpful and warm, and responded quickly to any queries. His B&amp;B is right next to the complex housing the Leaning Tower so it is the perfect place to stay at for seeing the Tower, Baptistery and Cathedral. There is also a square next to his building which is full of souvenir shops. Cheapest souvenir fridge magnets I found in Italy at 1 Euro compared to 3-4 Euros in other cities. Luca gave us good recommendations for dinner too and we had a great meal at La Taverna di Emma, which is just a couple of hundred metres down the road.

3752699,"Before I booked, I checked Trip Advisor and got mixed reviews but I decided to book based on value.  The hotel is old and the rooms are small. The bathroom is about 5'x6', there's no counter space and it's just dinjy with bad wall paper and old tile with mildew.  The TV is small and the furniture is cheap. Holiday Inn is better. I would compare it to a motel 6 with a large pool. Don't be fooled by the name, this is no &quot;RESORT&quot;. The lobby is old and tired. It may have been nice when it was built circa 1960 but the bad paint job and re-stucco fall short of any sort of renovation. The pool area is tacky and the gym has 20 year old Nautilus machines.  They probably ruined some nice mid century architecture with pink stucco and white columns.  The Best Western, Double Tree or the Holiday inn across the way are better values.  They also charge $9.00 a day for parking, many other hotels in area are free.  I'm glad I was only there 2 nights and only used the room to sleep. Even that was not so great, the sheets were rough, the bed cover was dirty and the blanket had a big tear in it.

There were two treadmills and two ellipticals, a small rack of handweights (5lbs - 30lbs) and one small bench.  It would really be nice to see if they could either add additional handweights or possibly a universal type machine. They should really expand the size of the gym or move it to a different location.

Then, the rooms are very small, and the bathrooms are tiny.  There's no turndown service.

The atmosphere was relaxed and not too stuffy, you can enjoy the day in your robe and slippers.  You can even enjoy your dining experience in your robe and slippers and feel right at home.The building is so beautiful and steeped with history, you could spend a day admiring the location, rooms and art. The quiet rooms were a lovely haven and I appreciate the games and magazines available. And I must say the couches in the spa treatment waiting area must be some of the comfiest I have ever sat on. The all inclusive nature of the spa is very nice. You don't feel the need to carry around a purse or anything with the complimentary lockers available.We were lucky to have Judy,  Devin,  and Tim to complete our treatments. And we couldn't be more pleased with how pleasant, professional, and talented they are.  Also, the young red haired lady at the front desk made us feel so welcome and started our whole day of right, unfortunately I did not catch her name.The food was so delicious we wanted more even though we were full. I never thought I would say the following sentence but, &quot;Ste Anne's Spa has the most undeniably best hamburger ever. It's so juicy, filling and flavorful, and as local as it gets&quot;. We feel so blessed having had the opportunity to visit for the day and hope we are able to visit again sooner rather than later. Afternoon tea is a lovely tradition that I would like to enjoy more of. With the delectable scones, fresh jam and whipped butter and a wonderful selection of hot tea selections, it was just the prefect way to end or stay. (I should say that scones aren't the only option. You could choose a sweet plate, a savory plate or a sampler as well).I have one teensy weensy disappointment unfortunately we picked Good Friday to visit and understandably the bakery was closed. So we weren't able to take home any of the delicious treats or meals to share that we enjoyed.I am sure any of the treatments are wonderful but I particularly enjoyed the Scalp Rejuvenation and Express Facial.

The beds were comfy and the room was large, It was clean and the staff was really friendly! If you want a historic setting this is the place for you...Andrew Jackson was in court on this site!!! It is also supposed to be haunted but nothing was noticed (and I slept with one eye open). The only reason I gave the place 4 stars is that we had the room just off the lobby in the front of the hotel and the garbage truck arrived at around 3 am and it sounded like a Jumbo jet landing outside. I expected a little noise from partygoers but this truck shook the shutters. There is a courtyard behind the lobby and I expect the noise levels to be reduced there but I have no clue if the rooms are as nice as ours was. But...all in all...I thought this place was special.

That being said the rooms are designed for dogs with tile flooring and an outside patio attached to a dog run.  Super set up for a dog.CONS The hotel is in desperate need of a face lift.   Evidently some rooms have been painted.  Our first night was in the &quot;suite&quot;. Room 20.   Lights didn't work, cobwebs around and pretty poorly maintained.  (Alex was quick to fix everything however.)   A vinyl sofa in the middle of the room in front of the TV.  The second night in a regular room was 100% better.  The room was painted in a cheery green and was much nicer   Definitely not worth paying extra for the so called 'suite'.   The rooms are only cleaned on request for the safety of employees - in case dogs have been left alone in room.  The motel is directly adjacent to the bike path where the local homeless seem to stay without attracting police attention and the trash they leave behind is huge.   There were about four groups of homeless sleeping by the sand dunes just in front of our window which was distressing.   Parks and Rec knew they were there but seem to turn a blind eye.Hotel is directly beneath the flight path so quite noisy and the walls are paper thin so it is easy to hear conversations in next door room and the rooms above echo every footstep taken.   We had ear plugs so won't overly concerned however.PROS Wonderful dog wash areaBreakfast is adequate with continual supply of coffee.Dog treats at check in complete with tennis ball.Super friendly staff.Great location.Mostly comfortable beds.   One bed in the suite appeared to be filled with straw like material so was uncomfortable.Walking distance to all ocean beach offers - great food, bars etc.   Parking for one car.  Non smoking rooms.This hotel 'could' be outstanding with a little TLC.   It is a perfect place to take a dog - we drove all the way from Albuquerque! and would do it again.   Would be so nice if someone would give this hotel some loving care.   It would be a gem.   Despite that we would probably come again as we know what to expect.   Price is reasonable mid week and if you use a Groupon.   Fairly pricey at weekends but they seem to fill the rooms so I can see why they don't bother to renovate too much.

At other BW Plus locations for Gold Elite members there are bathrobes in the rooms and sometimes even a welcome goodie basket - here, nothing.  Also, there's a real &quot;no frills&quot; selection of toiletries - just soap and shampoo/conditioner/shower gel dispenser.  No body lotion, mouth wash, shower cap, shoe shine cloth.If you are a light sleeper you are in for sleepless nights at this hotel.  The walls are paper thin - I could hear people talking at all hours in the rooms on either side of mine, and I was awakened by my neighbour's wake-up call at 5am.  Neighbours flushing toilets or taking a shower may as well be in your room based on the noise level.  Also, the heating/cooling system has to be updated - loud, loud, loud.

88090866,"Stayed here Nov 20 - Nov 22/10 as we went to the Monday Night Football Game.  We found the location to be excellent.  Within walking distance to the Trolley Station and Fashion Valley Mall (which is awesome).The lobby and entrance is very nice.  The staff were friendly and knowledgable and were pleasant to deal with.  The rooms were furnished and dressed nicely but could use some more help.  The doors didn't close properly so you had to the slam them (which is great when your neighbour comes home at 1am and has to reef on their door to close it OR when you are using the bathroom in your own room and your spouse is trying to sleep).  Really though, not the end of the world.The drain in the bathroom did not work at all, nor did the overflow drain, so the sink was always gross and overflowing.  The thing that really got me was the lingering smell.  My friend used to call the sulphur smell that water sometimes has &quot;fart water&quot;.  That's the first thing that came to mind for me.  It hung around pretty good.  I am sure that housekeeping had to have noticed when they cleaned the room every day...surely they ran the water in the sink?  In any event, the bathroom didn't really cut it for me but again, not the end of the world.The linens / bedding were nice and the matress was quite soft.  I slept OK considering we have a firm mattress at home.  There was a wedding the first night so there was not much sleep to be had for us given our neighbours were super loud and the noise really carries (as with most hotels I'm sure).  The pool area is by far the biggest and nicest I have seen so far (a few beauties in Palm Springs but this was nice too).  The outdoor furniture was not that cheap white plastic junk either, which we appreciated.  The restaurant was OK so we only had one breakfast there.  As usual, it was overpriced for what it was.  We have found that all hotel fare is overpriced.The long and short of it is: we would stay again if the price was right.  We paid $109 for a Premiere King with bottled water, bathrobe, WiFi, and parking included.

Which is why we chose it as a base for a 3 day stopover in LA. Funky, quirky and fresh would describe the vibe and the styling of the entire complex. My daughters loved the farm theme and extras like the denim bed coverings, old school tapware, rubber ducks and fairy lights made the stay different.Beds and pillows were comfortable, room was big enough for 4 of us, clean, well appointed and bathroom just fine.Service from all the staff was first rate, very friendly and accommodating. After our flight from Sydney we appreciated a room being made available at 10am!! We loved TART for wonderful breakfasts and the service there was excellent.Location was great, Peets coffee and Trader Joes on same block, directly opposite Farmers Market and The Grove and CVS on next block. Easily walkable to all. We used the cool bikes to ride to the Tar Pits/LACMA which took 10 mins and was a highlight of our short LA stay. Valet parking was 20-something a night, if you have a spare car key hang on to it as you'll probably walk past your car on the way to and from your room and can stow your shopping in the trunk instead of your room.We loved our stay at The Farmers Daughter and would definitely recommend it as a different option to the boring 3 star same-ville chain hotels you can find anywhere.",1,0.5744444444444445

The lifts require a keycard to operate and I was never noted of this (thank goodness a couple notified and saved me from standing there looking silly).The room was easy to find even with the awkward zig zag building layout because of the clear signs.Upon entering the room I really liked the layout, the shower and toilet were self contained in a modern pod like wet room so when my I flushed the toilet, I wouldn't wake my partner. The bed was comfortable and the room was clean.The only thing I can fault this hotel is it's depressing coloured carpet that sapped my soul and the &quot;awkwardly, overlapping, sliding, Velcro curtains&quot;.Overall I would highly recommend this room to others as it was function and central to shops and public transport.",1,0.4936694677871148

We first stayed there in 2006 when we were participating in the Kananaskis 100 running relay.  Since then, we have stayed there when participating in the Cookie Loppet cross-country ski race, for many ski weekends (we like to combine a day of cross-country skiing and a day of downhill at Nakiska), and even over New Year's a couple of years ago.  This place has everything going for it - lovely location, consistently good staff and a beautiful venue.  They are close to the cross-country ski trails in Peter Lougheed Park and there are even some trails right on the hotel property that are always well-groomed and quite under-used.  The food in the restaurants is great and the indoor/outdoor pool is consistently a highlight.  We always look forward to time here and have recommended it to many friends.",1,0.4577245670995671

580171117,The Fairmont Le Chateau Frontenac is all about the prestige and location. We had a great stay while visiting during the WITS conference this month - May 2018. Service was my only complaint. Housekeeping was not at the level that we thought it would be for such a beautiful property. Every room is unique because this is an old castle and the rooms are all slightly different which is quirky. The swimming pool and fitness area are lovely and the views from pool are amazing. In fact the views are stunning from most spots in the Chateau. Location is ideal. Walk all over the city from this base. Food was good and the conference location was perfect. Housekeeping returned dirty glasses to our room one morning which was not appealing. Not enough coffee for the Keurig.

It was wonderful to see the refrig stocked with various drinks at no charge, parking was included, the different events the hotel runs are very unique and make the guests feel welcome.  We loved the band that was playing blues by the pool that attracted a huge crowd, then at night showing old movies at happy hour and then on a big screen by the pool was great.  We encountered many such extras during our stay, and thought it was great to have a car rental firm, gift shop, and hair salon colocated also, in addition to the restaurant and bar.

311821764,"When we pulled up to the beautiful picturesque Cornstalk hotel. You see the wrought iron historic fence the home is named after. We arrived a little before check in and were immediately taken to our room.The Cornstalk is a gorgeous historical home and is beautifully decorated with crystal chandeliers, sofas, chairs and stairs (no elevator) to the second floor balcony with wrought iron table and chairs overlooking the meticulously landscaped courtyard with fountain while sitting and watching the passerby on Royal Street.The room was lovely when you enter the antique double doors, to see a room with a vaulted ceiling.  There is a dimmable crystal chandelier to set the mood above the comfortable queen size bed surrounded by textured classic wall coverings that suit the decor. The window coverings suit the room with wrought iron tie backs. A roomy antique chiffrobe for hanging clothes and limited storage. The room is small, but very clean with a small bathroom, complimentary lotion, shampoo, conditioner, soap and hair dryer. Plenty of plush towels to use.A few faults that pale in comparison to everything else was electrical outlets are very limited, no hot water for the first morning, but was taken care of immediately by on call maintenance staff. The cold water has to be adjusted gently due to limited hot water pressure in this room and the in-room A/C-heat thermostat was uncooperperative.Room 16 is located on the second floor.No refrigerator or in-room safe, but they will store valuables for you if needed and have ice, coffee, iron and ironing board if needed. (Just ask the front desk)We enjoyed the cute touches like lollipops in the lobby, complimentary wifi, bottled water and granola squares with turn down service when we got back to the room from a long day walking the French Quarter. The staff was very polite and went above and beyond with anything we needed. The privacy please sign was followed explicitly by staff and the room was very quiet. We were provided with a map of the FQ and recommended restaurants upon arrival.The location is perfect. Directly in the middle of the FQ. One block from Bourbon Street, 3 blocks from the river and everything is within walking distance.  We valeted our car for $35.00 a night, but the hotel will tell you about alternative parking if you ask. As we were leaving our vehicle was promptly delivered within 30 minutes to the reserved parking at the front of the hotel.We had a fantastic time and enjoyed our stay at The Cornstalk.",1,0.4374104835732742

This is a large 2 story motel and because our stay was on the weekend it was very busy. The desk staff was very busy but did give us the necessary information for checking in, location of room, and restaurants in the area. The room #260 was facing the Freeway so noise was a little problem. Room, with 2 queen beds, was of adequate size, soft mattress and pillows, and with a carpet that needed cleaning. Bathroom consisted of a small toilet and shower room. The counter holding the sink was a good size. The bad side was the towels that were very thin and the hot water was not the hot - hot  water you would expect for a shower. Breakfast Bar was a small area off the lobby with 5 tables. The selection was cold items and one waffle iron. The time we were there it was crowded with a lot activity around the bar. The attendant did a good job refilling the breakfast items.

65412600,"My wife and I spent a wonderful 5 days in Florence, followed by 2 days at this hotel in Pisa. It took us around 1 hour to travel from Florence to Pisa San Rossore train station - the nearest station to the hotel. Sadly, it took us over an hour to get from the railway station to the hotel, due to the incompetent help from the hotel. It should only have taken 20 minutes to walk to the hotel if you know what you're doing and you have the assistance of the hotel in getting there. There is no taxi rank at the train station. A traffic warden directed us to the taxi rank outside the Duomo, about a 10 minute walk. We then waited over 1/2 hour with no sign of a taxi. We phoned the hotel and asked them to order us a taxi. Regrettably, the person on the other end of the phone not only told us that a taxi would not come if he ordered one, but he gave us completely hopeless directions to the hotel, which he described as '800 metres' away....more like 8000 metres following his directions. He actually directed us away from the hotel before directing us in the right direction. It would be helpful if the hotel would put directions to its hotel from the train station at San Rossore.When we eventually arrived at the hotel - tired and stressed - he then proceeded to make a mess of booking us in. Fortunately, someone took over and booked us in without any difficulty. Indeed, apart from the dreadful service from this male member of staff, the staff were otherwise polite and helpful.Apart from the location, the hotel itself was very impressive and the room with balcony very nice indeed. The hotel, however, is clearly still undergoing construction and I think it will be some while yet before it deserves its 5 star status.Incidentally, they should do something about the ladies of the night hanging about on the main road outside the hotel!",0,0.5457619047619048

Close to all the business stuff I need to and to shops and restaurants alike. The elevator is SUPER TINY take the stairs if you are claustrophobic, the rooms are fine, no great views, but clean, giant TV if you want to tune out for a bit, room service is not pricey, breakfast is fine a bit expensive but fine. They have a pool which is warm and great, the gym is so so, really you could stay here and have a fine time. What did the average points is that they have tons of college kids staying here for whatever reason, and it seems fine with hotel management to allow them to play super loud music late at night, to have kids running around cursing, yelling and stumping doors. I did call the front desk and they sent someone over, but 5 minutes later they where back at it. I am changing rooms tonight but I had a hell of a night, and considering it's the daylight savings weekend I am a wreck. As usual if you value sleep let the front desk know, I am now trying to move to a room as far away as possible from big groups of people traveling together, which seems to be the trend here.

He keeps typed binders of the tours and the restraunts, their times, their menus and their prices.  He will talk over your choices with you and point out their advantages or disadvantages.  He then arranges the tours and schedules them so they all mess together without overlap.  (He even knows where to get the discount coupons).  If you need a taxi, he will get you one.  If you are too hot or cold he adjusts the temperature, and I mean immediately.   We live in Orlando, and we are used to great service, since we regularly stay at Disney Hotels.  You have my word for it, this gentleman even beats Disneys impeccable service.  Our stay was wonderful, never a care, he arranged everything.

I have to say that the level of service and the positive attitude and resposiveness of the staff was as good if not better than the more upscale properties.  Everyone was polite, friendly and truly seeking to provide excellent customer service. There is always a smile on the staff's face and a true desire to help with anything and everything.

We travel a lot, and are fairly - well, not demanding, but maybe picky is a good way to put it.  Despite booking last minute, we got an excellent price, and the hotel was able to fulfill our request for a view of the St-Laurent.The front desk staff was very friendly and obligingly spoke in either French or English depending on how we started the conversation.  They were very patient with my French, and their English was excellent.  Their suggestions for restaurants were great - especially Chez Anton for poutine, and they made us a last-minute reservation at Laurie Raphael.We stayed in the Marco Polo room which was quiet, and nicely furnished with a very comfortable queen-sized bed.  The bathroom was lovely (the sort of decor we are looking for in our next home) with beautifully scented amenities and a deep soaker tub that easily fit two and a bottle of champagne.  I was also a fan of the rain-style shower.The hotel cafe was great - on cold, rainy days it was a nice place to hang out and drink wine and eat cookies and play Scrabble -- without being overly harassed or underserviced by the wait staff.  They really knew exactly how to meet our requests without being intrusive or overbearing.  Check out the various antiquities around the cafe and hotel - pretty amazing.We would definitely return, and have already suggested that several of our friends make the trip out to Quebec to seek out this gem!",1,0.5475806451612903
506852424,"Looking like the Cinderella Castle from the world of Disney this is an iconic hotel, with an impressive lobby and in great location. But the regular rooms don't I'm afraid live up the the promise. The involuntary upgrade for the first night (they had mistakenly sold on my room so this was a purely defensive measure) gave me the chance to give the hotel a serious checking out. The gold floor is as you would expect; the rooms extremely comfortable and well equipped. But frankly, at the price they are charging, the standard rooms should have been at the same level, and they're way off the mark. They are regular rooms, of regular proportions, and there's a big capital spend round the corner if the hotel's to keep its iconic status. When the air con kicked off in the middle of the night, it sounded like the twister straight out of the Wizard of Oz (to continue with the Disney imagery), and my phone (which broke down) was of yellowing plastic that betrayed its age (my guess is it was from the 80s). And if you don't like fighting with nylon shower curtains, this isn't the hotel for you (alternatively you can pay a whole lot more, transfer to gold, and get the room you might have expected to find on the standard floors for the money). The other serious problem with this place is that, delightful as the staff are (and they are) there simply aren't enough to go round (explaining why service gets a miserable two stars). Two people (sometimes one) on check in is frankly inadequate. Woe betide you if you make the disastrous error or letting your magnetic key card come into contact with your loose change, iphone, or whatever metal object sits in your pocket, necessitating a trip to the front desk, because it's a 15 minute wait to get a new one, not to mention the trek round the meandering corridors looking for the poorly signposted lifts. The lobby, location and iconic status is all well and good, but (as has been commented on elsewhere), who wants to have the sensation of being in an upmarket bus station, as you walk through the lobby, so jammed pack is it with tour parties, guides in fancy dress, and people queuing to get replacement magnetic key cards, or simply trying to check in at the hopelessly under resourced front desk. The gym was fine, and there's a nice place outside to relax, and sink some Canadian vodka if that's your thing. But they're missing the basics and the rooms need some serious money spent on them. They can start by getting rid of the nylon shower curtains, and go from there. So I'm afraid it's three stars for this place given the price you pay to stay in this Quebec stalwart.",0,0.470821067821068

We were upgraded to a one bedroom suite.  Great city views, plenty of room- fridge, coffee maker, etc.  We received a coupon when we checked in for free room service snack (apple/yogurt or cookies) for my 6 year old daughter-  great perk.

We booked our room at the Handlery Hotel San Diego primarily because it was one of the rare mid - range hotels to offer free parking and WI-FI (crazy I know).

On a weeks trip when we had already eaten too many good cooked English breakfasts it was almost a relief to buy some cereals and milk at one of the local stores and add them to the fruit and croissants available at reception.

7555076,"My husband and I went to Ste. Anne's for the first time this past weekend. I do think it's a great getaway and the property is fantastic. I do not, however agree that it's &quot;perfect&quot;, nor am I sure I understand it's 4 star designation. First the positive: There was a special on this weekend so we paid $375/pp per night and we felt we got great value at that rate. The first reason for the high value rating was the food. Some may disagree, especially those with a richer palate but both my husband and I thought the food was very high quality. We've eaten in some of the best restaurants in Toronto and paid a premium for such quality food. And at Ste. Anne's it seems like an endless supply of really great food! You never go hungry and the food is all included in the one price.  I can honestly say we've never eaten better soups, and that's  just one example. I could fill up one review on the food alone!I also love the all-inclusive aspect, since it removes an element of stress. You don't have to worry whether you're tipping everyone appropriately, etc. I loved walking around in my robe all day - I'll pack less clothes next time! I've never been to a spa so I wasn't aware that it was quite ok to lounge in a robe. The staff I found to be very helpful. I was a bit apprehensive going in, wasn't really sure what to expect by anything and I was made to feel quite comfortable. I tried meditation for the first time, which is completely out of character for me and I was made to feel comfortable. I was only disappointed that I couldn't get into more classes so I could try some more firsts in an unintimidating environment - but the classes were full. I had 4 spa treatments and everyone made me feel comfortable. The spa staff were all lovely. The service desk staff and the waiting staff were all great. The only negative thing I could say at all about the staff is that across the board their mantra seemed to be &quot;we're very busy this weekend&quot;. Although that may be the case, in a place where you want people to relax and focus on themselves I'm not sure it's good to constantly remind people they  may not get a spot in a class and it's not all about them because there are many other people there. But, in general, the staff were great. So, here's the but...and it won't prevent me from returning but it is the difference between good and great:   I was consistently disappointed in the lack of attention to detail in the actual facilities themselves. This isn't just to find something negative to say, but for me, the consistency of this caused the whole experience not to feel as luxurious as I felt it should have. It started right from the front door and went on from there: The slipcovers on the sofa's seemed out of place, the walls in the restaurants were chipped and marked,the wall in the fitness rooms was really scuffed and the place just looked like it was a little unloved to me. On the walking trail, direction signs were still attached to fallen down trees so it was difficult to know where to go at times. My final spa room was in the &quot;old part&quot; and I felt like I was going through somebody's basement. I understand it's an old building but it could be cleaned up more to feel more like a relaxing journey as you go through those basement halls. The ceilings in the spa rooms were cheap tiles -  in some cases stained and generally not very attractive. Given that most of a person's time in a spa room is spent looking at the ceiling that's a distraction. I would have draped fabric over it - anything to make it feel more soothing. We stayed in the renovated wing and I was really disappointed in the fit and finish. My stone castle illusion was shattered with the quality of this reno. It reminded me of a suburban home with the spindled stairwell, standard doors and brass finishes. Our  tub surround seem to be hand built by a shoddy contractor with a brass trim that I scraped my leg on when getting out of the tub. The reno'd wing also has standard Home Depot hardwood where it would have added so much character to use some kind of wider planked reclaimed wood to match the old part. On the inside there is no flow from old to new, and I think that hurts the overall illusion. So, all of this may seem petty given the positive's but to me attention to detail is what makes a place exceptional and Ste. Anne's facilities lack that. It seems such a shame since the fundamentals like setting, scenary and service are there to not hit the home run and make the place spectacular. People obviously love it per their TA ratings, so maybe my hangups don't matter. I do think, though, if they want to move forward on their &quot;master plan&quot; and time sharing plans that they discuss in their materials they will have to bring it up a notch in order to impress investors. So yes, I will be back, if not for the overall surroundings for the food, setting and service.",1,0.5263874864211945

Housekeeping staff were efficient and friendly. The negatives were: 1) Parking - rates are absurd at &gt; $30/day. By parking in a nearby Village lot and purchasing a MONTHLY pass for the same $30 (which allows parking in any Village lot), we saved quite a bit.  2) To get hot water in the shower in the AM, we had to run the tap at full strength for ~ 15 minutes (not exaggerating). What a major waste of water! When this first happened on Day 1, I mentioned it to the front desk, and a staff member said he would 'check into this'.  When it happened again on Day 2, he admitted that this is just the way it is in the South Tower (and indeed, it was that way all week).  3) The hotel bar, which is really noisy and full of drunk 20-somethings yelling and spilling out into the hallway, staggering into guests trying to get to the elevators.

I finally picked Hilton Whistler because (1) it has a slightly higher ranking on TA than Westin; (2) it is closer to the center of Village; (3) HHonors has a double dipping bonus program and free breakfasts for elite members.I was right. The hotel is fantastic and despite it was a Delta property, the decor is very contemporary and up-to-date.Things I like:(1) Free breakfasts for diamond (&amp;gold members?) up to two people - $52+tax value per day!(2) The staff is very courteous and professional;(3) The 1-bedroom suite is huge, and even Whistler Jr. suite is spacious enough to accommodate family of 4 - great for a family vacation!(4) Nanny service is available and can be arranged by Hilton front desk;(5) Outdoor heated pool is very fancy.(6) The hotel is very very close to Gondola and center of the Village.Things need improvement:(1) $29+tax parking per day is way too pricey (valet parking is more expensive). Basically you don't need your car at Whistler but I have to have a car to drive up to the hotel. I understand parking space is limited in Whistler, but there got be some way to make improvement;(2) There is only one restaurant in property. While the food is great, I did wish to experience some variety in a resort hotel. I have been to many exotic yet superb Hilton resorts and by far Hilton Whistler is the only hotel has only one restaurant - CBBG.A side note - there are tons of great restaurants in the Village and this may be why CBBG is the only restaurant there. Just randomly pick ANY restaurant in the Village and you won't be disappointed. Contrary to many comments I read on FT and TA, Whistler is not that expensive (well, comparing with Bora Bora and Maldives, of course not) - a dinner for 2 adults and 2 kids range from $60 to $80 in general.In sum, I had a great time there and will definitely return to Hilton Whistler again.",1,0.6454232804232805

Firstly the building and decor are simply stunning, tucked away in a quiet courtyard with lemon trees growing out front it truly feels like a slice of Tuscan heaven.  It is decorated in light, airy neutrals and the attention to details is evident everywhere from the delicate piano music in the mornings to the enormous library of books stacked everywhere to striking effect.  There is no sign on the street but it was very easy to find the right door where there is a buzzer for Di Camilla which opens in to the courtyard.  We stayed in the âRaffaelloâ room which was spacious, immaculately clean and elegantly decorated.  Breakfast was beautifully presented each morning, a typical Tuscan breakfast consists of more pastries and sweet cakes than savoury fayre but for me thatâs all part of the joy of discovering new cultures and cuisines (the cappuccino is incredible by the way)!  The owners are utterly charming, we felt so welcome in their home &amp; they couldnât do enough to ensure our stay was beyond  five star.  We asked if they could recommended a local restaurant, they suggested âAlle Bandierineâ  5 minutes walk away and I can safely say it was sensational!  We also tried âIr Tegame Spaghetteriaâ a bit further down the road which was out of this world!  Di Camilla is brilliantly centrally positioned about 15 minutes walk from the leaning tower and we caught the train to Florence a couple of days running which was an easy 20 minute walk across the river.

You have to have a ticket (seperate from your room key) to get in and out of the parking lot gates, and that was a headache.  When you are coming and going from the hotel multiple times per day like I was, it gets rather tedious to have to keep track of a paper ticket.  One night as I attempted to enter the gate into the lot, I put my ticket in the machine and it jammed (apparently this happens often).  Needless to say, the gate wouldn't open, and no one could get into the parking lot until someone fixed it.  As far as traffic goes, my best advice is to avoid Hotel Circle during commute hours if you can.  The traffic situation is absolutely rediculous.  For some reason, traffic seemed worse during the evening hours than during the morning hours.  From the time I exited the freeway on to Hotel Circle each evening, it literally took me 35 minutes to do half the loop of the circle and get to the hotel.  This is not hotel's fault, but it is definitely something that might weigh heavily on my decision about whether or not to stay here again in the future.</span><span class=""taLnk ulBlueLinks moreBtn"" onclick=""widgetEvCall('handlers.clickExpand', event, this);"">More</span>",0,0.5066045548654243
63047304,Me and my fiance stayed in the Bonavista Suite and it was perfect. The room was very clean and tastefully decorated. It had candles around the jacuzzi to set a more romantic mood and even supplied the matches. Was the first place i stayed where they had a corkscrew in the room. We also liked the fact of having our own entrance so we did not have to go through the lobby every time we came back. Plus the bed was incredibly comfortable. Cant wait to go again :),1,0.6843333333333333
120800056,"We stayed here for three nights this past September. We were looking for a place with convenient access to downtown and secure on site parking where we wouldn't pay a fortune and wouldn't get stuck in morning SF traffic when leaving - we were heading south on the coast highway when leaving and this provided great access to that route. I've fought my way through San Francisco morning traffic from downtown before - not really knowing my route and following the Garmin GPS - and I prefer not to do that again.Our room had a fridge and a microwave, a double bed, a bathroom and a credenza sort of dresser. The room was small but very clean - as was the bathroom - no funny smells in our room. The window opened onto the outdoor hallway and we opened it at night when we got back to the room for some fresh air, but we closed it when we went to sleep. We were at the back on the second floor overlooking the car park area so we didn't really hear the trolly as it came and went. We were hardly in the room anyway. Too much to do and see!It was very easy to get to where ever we wanted to go on the trolly line because it goes downtown where you can connect with everything from BART to the MUNI Buses etc. The owners were friendly and organized with regard to check in and check out - we had a reservation. This motel is what I would describe as pretty spartan, the decor was 20th century mobile home, but it was comfortable and our towels and linens were clean. When we return by air we'll probably stay closer to downtown since we won't care about the parking, but this worked really well for this trip.",0,0.4146527777777778

We had room #1 on 1st floor which was very large with a balcony and they had a room on the 2nd floor which was beautiful.  Both rooms  had views of the boardwalk and river which was delightful.  The service was exceptional and staff was very friendly.  The location, was perfect and price was excellent.  We even had views of the Frontenac without the expense.

We ate in buffet so I don't know what their food service for a meal other than buffet would be like. A great place to have a wedding or conference. Downsides are the jets flying in low overhead. VERY noisy. The number of conferences and weddings going on. It seems that the staff was able to meet the large amount of people very well. The other downside is for the second year in a row we were overcharged for our room and had to go over the room bill in close detail. ",1,0.532514880952381

Our room was fairly small, which was fine as we didn't spend much time in it. It wasn't anything special- but it worked fine for a night's sleep. We did enjoy the jacuzzi that night, which was great, sat in the outdoor restaurant area by a heater under the stars, and had a drink in the bar. It was a very enjoyable evening and I feel it was a good value. My only complaint really would be that while the bed was very comfortable, the pillows were bags of weird lumps.

Since it has a window, it is very airy and refreshing.. The bathroom is small and stuffy and for some rooms, the toilet is placed in a very awkward place. The toilet seat also needs some repairing. The walls do need to be re-painted, especially the breakfast area. The shower cubicle was very small. The room itself is very nice.

Our first day our concierge recommended different areas to explore and things to see. He also told us about a free Cirque du Soleil show that we would have missed he not taken the time to orient us when we arrived. One afternoon the power went out in the majority of Old Quebec due to a thunderstorm and when we got back to our hotel after being caught in the rain they had a big box of flashlights ready for the guests and they made sure everyone had extra towels to dry off without us having to ask. On top of the great service, we were on a beautiful street in a very convenient area - we could walk to anywhere we needed to go, and they provided parking a couple of blocks away. The hotel itself and its surroundings are stunning. The decor mixes well the history of the building with the super modern furnishings. It felt very stylish.The room we stayed in was on the smaller side but very nice and cozy. We didn't feel like we were cramped up at all. (Tip: there is lots of toiletry storage on shelves behind the mirror above the sink.

Although the room appeared clean upon first sight, we found a dirty tea cup with dried up tea leaves still inside it and an old sock in a dark corner by the washroom. Figuring that most businesses would give you an inferior product if it's for free like in my case, I still mentioned the 2 issues I had with front desk when I checked out. Well the receptionist was most apologetic, took note of my room number to deal with the issues and credited me with free parking (which lasts until 6pm even though check-out is 11 am) so this stay cost me nothing! Everything was otherwise fine with the room, nice to have the coffee/tea station OUT OF THE WASHROOM (unlike some hotels, and it irks me to make my hot beverages in a washroom), and another staff member at front desk stepped up to find me (via Google) the nearest tea shop so I could buy my friend a gift before I left the hotel.

144894416,"We stayed for 3 nights with our 2 children (4 years old and 14 weeks old) as we were up visiting family in and around Glasgow. We arrived around 10.30pm after a long journey and checked in easily with a really nice, helpful lady who I think was called Lucy or Lisa. Our room was one half of a lock-off which meant there was a connecting door to the next room - more on this shortly!The first thing I noticed was that the sofa bed had not been made up and there was no bedding to enable us to do it. We called reception and Lucy/Lisa came up immediately and made the bed for us so our daughter could get to bed. She was very apologetic. So, we unpacked, made our son's travel cot and went to bed. Shortly after midnight we were woken up by loud conversation coming from next door. It sounded as though they were in the room with us so when it hadn't quietened by 1am my husband got dressed and went down to reception. A member of staff then came up and had a word with next door and after another half hour or so the noise had reduced enabling us to get a little sleep! The next morning we were moved into another room and were given a full refund for that night. As for the rest of our stay, the rooms and public areas were very clean. Breakfast was of good quality and a nice choice of food and drinks. Parking is not great as it is an entertainment complex (cinema and restaurants) so coming back in the evenings meant it was difficult to get a space. One of the nights I had to struggle up the stairs from car park to hotel with both kids (no ramp for prams so baby was in his heavy car seat) it then took my husband almost 30 minutes to get a space! On the positive side, parking is free but you must remember to log your vehicle details with the hotel when you check in. I would book here again but next time I'll state clearly that I do not want a lock-off! ",1,0.4216982323232323

To be honest, it was the perfect location for me as it was just across the courtyard to the front desk and I was bothered neither by traffic, late nite revelling, or by elevators or pop machines.........When I'm on vacation, I'm usually so tired I rarely need to put in my ear plugs...I did love my room with the denim bedspread, condom kit you could purchase (or bandaid kit) and really loved all the front desk staff.They were super helpful,and there is a computer out back you  can use too if need be..........IPOD worked sporadically in my room.....They give you a code to use at check in......found it easier to use their desk top computer and it was never busy...I really loved the book exchange at front of hotel where you could exchange books to read,and I loved all the freebies, postcards, books of matches, cookies, chips, sweet tea,and spiced apple cider.......And, they even have a free whiskey tasting hour...........Staff is super friendly, whether it be the manager of the hotel or the workers........It would be nice if there was a cushion on either of the 2 chairs in the room,but I just sat on a pillow......Overall, a great location to stay if you want to be near the Price is Right, Dancing with the Stars, The Farmer's Market, or The Grove.............We would definitely choose this hotel again..........Perhaps a little pricy, but for us, The Price Was Right.........thanks so much staff for making our stay such a pleasant one!",1,0.6183982683982682

The room itself was a good size with comfortable beds and other standard amenities. The wash basin and the toilet area were really small though but for a one night stay like ours, it wasn't much of a bother. What surprised me is that for a hotel accommodating 1000+ people, this place did not feel overcrowded. The sheer size of the property, with its well planned and well spanned rooms along with the beautiful flowers, the pool and the water fountains actually gives it the look and feel of a resort. We loved taking a walk through the property in the mornings. Plenty of parking space available (charged at $20 per night though). The location of this property is not in the city center but just a 10 min uber ride to downtown.

141959257,It is easy to fall in love with old Quebec City just by walking out the back door of this charming hotel. Around you are art galleries filled with colorful art and ahead a walk up to the oldest part of the city. Take this walk early in the morning when the air is crisp and there are no tourists around. Walk up to the park below the Chateau Fontenac. Look up and see this grand dame rising aristocratically above you.Then turn around and walk back to enjoy your delicious breakfast. The staff at the desk are the best one could ask for. The location is absolutely wonderful.,1,0.534375
145776210,"My wife and I haved stayed at this location many, many times and have always enjoyed our  stay it is close to many attractions, stores, reastuarants, malls movies etc. And the hotels is always neat and clean and very hospitable.",1,0.5333333333333333
603570333,"The Chateau Frontenac is a fine hotel and it cannot be beaten for location to see old Quebec.  Our room was small- too small for an extra chair to sit and read in-  but comfortable.  If you can afford to get a room with a view, this hotel would be nothing short of spectacular.  We, however, had a room with an off set window that looked out at the roofs in the courtyard area.  That being the case, we ended up feeling like the Farimont Chateau Frontenac was just a very expensive place to stay.",1,0.5011111111111111

Pros:Rooms !!! very nice, clean, modern - best shower I've ever had!LocationInteresting mix of old (artifacts) and new (building)Cons: Staff were visible but not exactly warm. I didn't like the fact that their concierge desk was never manned. You had to go to the reception desk and ask the question and they'd walk over to the concierge desk. Having just visited a &quot;lesser&quot; hotel I was a little disappointed with this appearance...as the staff at the other hotel were much more personable. Expensive",1,0.506118881118881
148403319,This hotel is ideally located among the restaurants and shops of the lower town of old Quebec. It's friendly and welcoming.

Then I leveled the microwave that was on top of the fridge so that every time the fridge came on the microwave fan stopped rattling (very annoying noise that no one could have slept through).  Last complaint--2 light bulbs burned out in room--desk lamp &amp; floor lamp next to desk.  I also have a recommendation--install the shower curtain correctly (so the ends fold into the tub instead of out &amp; the water will be reflected back into the shower-not out on the floor).

119561597,"Booked this as our first stop after our overseas flight into Pisa.  When I inquired as to directions from the airport to the B&amp;B, they offered to meet us at the airport.  That was very nice and made things easy on our jetlagged brains.  It was a very short 5 minute walk out of the airport and across a fairly busy street to the small street where the property is located.  It wasn't a problem to do even when pulling luggage.The exterior is very neat and inviting.  The interior is clean and new looking while maintaining its rustic farmhouse appeal.  We had a room on the first floor with a window that opened to the parking area.  We had the window open and noise wasn't a problem for us.We chose to walk to see the Leaning Tower.  I would estimate that it is probably about 2 miles.  We enjoyed the walk through the residential area to the train station and then the more commercial area around the train station and on through the university and historic area.  The bus picks up right outside the B&amp;B and they gave us information on the bus and even looked to see if they had any bus tickets laying around, however we ultimately decided to just walk both ways.We were taking the train to Venice the next morning and were able to catch it right at the airport.  Breakfast was laid out the night before and available no matter how early you needed to leave.  Breakfast consisted of several types of bread, yogurt, cereal, beverages, etc.I would definitely stay here again.",1,0.427638961038961

At 3:30 we called to follow up on the order and discovered that during the &quot;shift change&quot; it must have been forgotten to be applied.  The next shift took responsibility apologized and comped the order.  This showed strong teamwork and we appreciated the assistance and tipped them well.

606494104,"Occupying a prime location within easy strike of all the must-sees in QCâs Lower Town, Le Auberge SA provided very agreeable accommodations for a family visit. Youâd need to very fastidious to find much to complain about here but there are a couple of need-to-knows if you want to get the most from your stay. The good: the front door and reception were slick and welcoming. Our rooms (luxury king room with terrace + a comfort room with two double beds) were spacious, well appointed, comfortable and mostly quiet. Everything expected was there and it all worked as expected. The beds were cosseting, the linens plush and the pillows cloud-soft. The king room bathroom was extravagantly spacious and both of them were well-lit, well-appointed and everything functioned as it should. The included wifi worked well on all our devices. The included (in one of our rooms â see below) breakfast was a quality buffet taken in the hotelâs chic Chez Muffy restaurant or on the adjoining sun-drenched terrace. Valet parking @ C$ 30/day took care of our car for the duration.                        The not so good: itâs had to find much to finger here but our first breakfast (Sunday) was a little unsettled when the miniscule breakfast facility around the bar area was totally overwhelmed and it took some time for the staff to redirect an ever-expanding queue of pensive guests to the more expansive â and expensive â brunch being served at the restaurant. Weekday breakfasts default to the restaurant. Be aware: for reasons that are still a mystery we were only able to reserve one room on the hotelâs website because no other room was available - apparently - yet we were spoiled for choice with available rooms on a booking agentâs website. And this was nine months before our stay date. The downside was that the direct-booked roomâs included breakfast which was not included with room from the agency reservation.",1,0.4625

My hosts have booked me into a different hotel each time - but this is the first one that I would be happy to stay in again.

First, the hotel is right next to the freeway and we were given a room on the front side so I thought for sure we'd hear everything.  Not at all.  We had the fan on to cool off and I never once heard a freeway sound until I stepped outside.  The hotel was much cleaner and more comfy than I thought it would be for the price and the staff, with the exception of the guy who checked us in, could not have been more helpful.

It had a bar, living room, dining area, large separate bedroom and a huge bathroom with a jacuzzi tub and a huge shower. The bed was very comfortable. The meeting facility is very well run, and worth consideration if you have an event. While there is a large selection of restaurants in the casino, I only patronized two: The Cafe Sienna served up a decent, inexpensive early bird breakfast special. The Bagel Cafe Express has pretty good sandwiches, although they seemed a bit pricey. Otherwise, I preferred to get out and eat somewhere else.

AVwdIPxpkufWRAb52lqx,"We stay at this hotel every year same time for an event at Angel Stadium the 1st weekend in Jan.We never have issues but when it rains it pours with this group...We checked in and they lost our reservation because I had called on a re-rate. They changed the name on the reservation, they changed it from a one bed to a studio and raised the rate from 109 to 129 We booked in Oct but 1st of Nov they put up a disclaimer that the hotel is under remodel...but the disclaimer was not on the webpage when we booked. Remodel is an understatement its a train wreck. There was 4 or 6 couches piled up in front of a cargo bin just sitting there with some other ragged furniture and lamps in part of the parking lot.Our 1st room was nice but getting to the room was a mess, floorboards missing, walls messed up, the door wide open to the electronics closet which cant be seen by the front desk so anyone could walk in and create havoc. I am sure there is credit card info in those backup etc.It was late about 10:30 and we rented a PPV and then we hear something in the kitchen area and its a rat that runs behind the stove and now is stuck and screaming. So we go down to the front desk and then send a guy up to try and catch the rat. He cant catch it so they tell us we need to move to the other building.We do and its a bigger mess then the 1st building. There is black goop all over the floor in leading to the elevator and then in the elevator too, the 2nd building is old,smells and needs remodel bad. The new room is 2 bedroom but its hit and miss, way to much furniture, kitchen is dated, microwave falling down, dusty and dirty and about a 3 gap under the front door so someone could look in if they wanted.When we tell them the room will not work they offer to move us back to the 1st building but to the room a joining the room with the ratIt was just a trip hotel from hell which is really sad because its normally an ok hotel. We book next time at Hilton.Was really disappointed that management didn't reach out to us in till we contacted them.John Dominguez Assistant GM useless!Thank you for rating us on trip advisor as we are always looking to improve our hotel and do well by all of our guests. As most business professionals I was not available during the weekend while you were here at the property: however, we always have a manager on duty.As we are currently undergoing renovations, we have the challenge of insuring that our hotel continues to operate with minimal disruption to our guests. We understand that finding a mouse in your room can be an unnerving situation and tried to put you at ease for the duration of your stay. My staff did need to relocate you to another room so that we could have an external company resolve the issue which has now been rectified and make sure that you had a comfortable and pest free stay.Im happy to see that my staff offered you an upgraded newly renovated accessibility suite that did not have any adjoining wall or door to the previous room. We are sorry that you declined it. My understanding is the manager also offered to purchase a shower chair as the remaining 16 accessible rooms were fully committed. The Suite that you were relocated to was an upgraded suite as an additional apology for the issue that occurred. In my email to you on Monday after you had departed I explained that the renovation construction team working in the building you had relocated to did in fact make scuff marks on the floor from the tires of the dolly's that they were using to move the larger furniture out of the rooms to make way for the new furniture that we were receiving. As we placed you in an un-renovated suite for the final part of your stay, I can understand why you would feel it was out dated as the renovation is to give us a more modern and updated look and this suite had not been completed as of yet. As per Marriott standard the renovation information was available to all guests as of the beginning of October prior to when your reservation was made. Jeanette the Manager on duty removed your charges for the first night due to the mouse incident, while isolated, is unacceptable. We sincerely apologize as no guest should ever experience that. As you have stated, you have stayed with us numerous times and have never had any issues.The room you noticed with the door opened was awaiting a new air conditioning unit, there is nothing in this room that would present a security issue for our guests. We will also be purchasing some extra assistance chairs to accommodate past our eighteen accessibility rooms. again our apologies that your stay was less than perfect. We hope that you will give us another opportunity to welcome you again during the annual super cross event at Angel Stadium.",-1,0.4529847656896837
194673586,"I am one that always tries to see the positive, however, our one night at this hotel left me feeling frustrated.  First I must start with the good.  The hotel is in a wonderful location.  It's pretty clean and the front desk staff are wonderful and accommodating.  Just as they should be, but they go above and beyond for you.  Our check in was quick, despite a line up.  The spa looked lovely, and the pool area was great.Every year my kid's school arranges for skiing lessons at Nakiska and this hotel graciously offers us a group rate for the one night (the kids ski Tue and Wed for lessons, most families like to stay Tue night).  We decided to stay this year for convenience, although the driving time we saved, was spent waiting in the restaurant forever for our food.  When the group booking was made the hotel was made aware that we would have a large group in for dinner, so it shouldn't have been a surprise.  Upon arrival a group of us decided to go to the Fireweed Grill as they had a mediocre kids buffet.  We immediately notified the front desk that we would be going there in 3 hours for dinner, to give them time to prepare for a large group.  The front desk thanked us for giving them notice and promptly made our reservation.  We arrived right on time for our reservation and were seated.  It took 20 minutes to get a drink order taken, and at least 45 minutes in before our meal order was taken.  At this time I thought I might as well just pay for the kids buffet dinner and leave, so they didn't have to wait for us to eat.  However we were assured it wouldn't be too long for our food and ordered.  over an hour later we got our food.  That's over 2 hours of waiting, 2 hours of our night and together time wasted in an overpriced restaurant.  But that's not all!  Our first server was incredibly rude.  After seating the kids at one table, and they had started eating, she tried to move them to another smaller table where they wouldn't fit.  Then tried to tell us that we had too many people for our reservation and had a mini hissy fit, leaving us even more frustrated.  I spoke with the manager, whom was lovely and offered us wine, and later on the rude server came back and apologized... which was probably one of the most awkward moments of the evening because of the lack of sincerity and how she was kind of apologizing and yet it was more of a &quot;I'm sorry you took it the wrong way&quot;... um actually we all took it the same way, all 10 of us adults.  Clearly, it was you, not us.  I know we all have bad days, but this was clearly just an attitude problem.  Another kicker was that two families in our group were turned away from eating in the restaurant, because they didn't have reservations, and yet another family with us that didn't reserve got in.  Apparently there was a LONG wait last year for the group and we will most definitely NOT be eating there again.  Go somewhere else, your time is worth something.  I have to mention too that the restaurant was not busy at all, several empty tables through the many hours we were in there.I will stay here again but will avoid the fireweed grill at all cost.  I heard the other restaurants were much better (from the group that got turned away from the horror story restaurant we were at).",0,0.4417496392496393

You can't stand in about 1/3 of the space, and there is only a tiny window. I felt like I was in a dungeon. While the location is great and the place has potential, the charm is lost in the furniture, beds and details (no mirror in room, previous request for double bed was not attended).

At least in our room there was a corner shower that was huge - by the looks of it 3 people could have fit in there no problem. As much hot water as you wish! We had 4 different rooms booked for our stay, altogether there were 9 of us, so that was quite a group. Our room was on the ground floor, very end of the hall on the left. Still remember it as if it was yesterday! Bed was very comfortable and prices in the minibar affordable (surprise, surprise as usually it is the most expensive gross domestic product ever). The cleaning staff were lovely, they made you feel like nothing was too much for them, and i know how hard it usually is - i was a housekeeping manager. None the less, much credit goes to a young front desk gentleman who has so much knowledge about the area, we had no problems getting around, even though we didnt speak a word of italian.

The stairs were narrow but didn't pose much problem for us as we take it as an exercise for all the good food that we have been eating in Pisa! The receptionists were very helpful. They even helped us to book a reservation in the restaurant nearby. Moreover, they also guide us to where to eat and helped us whenever we're lost. In addition, they helped us to get a taxi to the airport as well.I have a very fond memory of the hotel because I lost my purse in Pisa and have only realised when I was mid air flying back to England. I had contacted the hotel to search my room and they did and told me they could not find my purse. Two days later, the taxi man came back to the hotel and gave my purse to the receptionist as I must have left it in the taxi while rushing to catch my flight. All my cards, money were as it was and nothing was stolen. The hotel even offered to courier post it back to me. They have been so helpful and I really thank them for that.

We have a room with external bath, but there were a sink and a bide in the corner of our room. Covered by plain ceramic tiles, without any screen this corner looks like a doctor's cabinet in a rural clinic. Very simple, primitive, shabby furniture vividly contrasted with the palazzo interior. The elevator was no more than any cupboard, two people (or one + luggage) is limit for its capacity. So we used by gorgeous marble staircase. Breakfast was good.

This was much appreciated.The room itself was very clean, as is my expectations of all Marriott properties.New decor is comfortable and the large LG hi-def TV is great.New bathroom lay-out is an improvement over the original, with a few exceptions.I liked the bar although choices were limited and also the &quot;cafe&quot; with take away salads and other fresh food choices.Staff was always helpful and friendly.The bad.$15/day for parking!   Gimme a break!  This is a Courtyard in Mission Valley hotel hell, not Manhatten.  General theme is hip run amuck.   Large TVs blaring all around the lobby.   If the 20 somethings that were there in front of the screens, with computers open and also buried in their iPhones are indicative of biz today, no wonder we're in a recession.No opening windows or balconys.No towel racks in the bathroom.  Very inconvenient.  Maybe it's hip to just have folded towels and nowhere to hang everything.Glass &quot;glasses&quot; are replaced by plastic cups.  Pretty cheesy.  I expect this in Comfort Inns,  not Courtyards.If this is the future of the Courtyard brand, then I&quot;m out.

Very enjoyable walk through the city... various stops at the ice-cream parlours. You can get a bus to the Tower if you want. The bus station is right next to the train station!!2) B&amp;B Immaculate... Stunning... Gorgeous... Clean... Safe.Miguel kindly reserved an entire floor for my family on the 1st floor (2 double rooms and a family room for 2 adult and a bunk bed for 2 children). The rooms were amazing... all had on-suite bathrooms. Our rooms were cleaned daily and beds made. All the rooms had TVs with satellite TV. Fresh continental breakfast was served every morning with teas and coffees and it was delicious. A great way to start the day.3) HostMiguel went above and beyond for my family.... On arrival, he was 1st class. Helping us with our luggage and getting us settled in. He then asked us what we want to do whilst on holiday... We said a few basic things... He then spent about an 1hour giving us a step by step breakdown of the best places to go, where to eat, best ice-cream parlours etc. Miguel speaks fluent in English, Italian and French.

The staff at reception were really friendly, spoke very good English and gave us tips as where to visit. Can't say much about the pool as it was closed when we visited.

The hotel is located on a very quiet street, with limited automobile access, and with easy access to the tourist spots in the Lower Town. We were given a very quiet room away from the street on a higher floor, so no noise issues. The reception staff Kimberly and Tanya were extremely helpful at check-in and during the rest of our stay. My wife needed a small refrigerator to keep her prescription eye-drops cold and this was delivered without charge. The room was adequately sized for our stay with separate toilet and shower room. There was a closet with a safe, clothes hangers and drawers.The included breakfast was plentiful with a good selection of hot and cold dishes, fresh fruit, orange juice, tea &amp; coffee etc. We would not hesitate to stay here again, should we be fortunate enough to visit your beautiful city.PS - if you are craving the best crepes in Quebec City, go to Le Billig, 481 Rue St. Jean",1,0.5663095238095238

In my opinion, it is a perfect conference venue.  In addition, the grounds are very beautiful and well kept.  We even like the restaurants that are on-sight (Charlies and the Trellises Garden).  The only issue are the rooms.  We stayed in the Royal Palm tower, while clean and very quiet, the room was in serious need of updating. It was very old.

I was redirected through so many 'Press one for reservation' channels to which every avenue you chose ended with 'The number you have dialled is incorrect' there was absolutely no chance of getting hold of anyone at all! When we finally arrived in Manchester - still completely clueless to where we were going we wandered into the wrong hotel and were redirected down to the next Ibis which was a 10 minute walk down the street. When we arrived we were asked to take a seat in the restaurant with a member of staff who was checking us in - I found it so odd there was no checking in desk just a couple of people gathered around a till. Not the best welcome. All we wanted to do was get the bags in the room and go out, not sit down and unload before the (very long) walk to our hotel room.We were also told that we could not receive any discount which is usually offered to guests staying at the hotel for parking on the NCP as we parked at the wrong NCP! A fact we would have known if there was any way at all to be able to contact the hotel prior to our stay!! So I am now Â£25.00 lighter that I had planned before our night out.

460786645,"First, I have to say most of my issues with this property are simply not easily fixable.  The staff was very nice, and overall it was fine.The hotel itself is small and not as well decorated as most other Sheraton properties.  The rooms were basic, but good toiletries and the water pressure in the shower was good (I know that is important to a lot of people).  I got room service breakfast and it was a tad pricey, but not horrendous. Yogurt and fruit, with a juice was $16.40. It did not come with the granola as it said it would, but mistakes happen. There is a breakfast buffet for $14.00 day. There are few food choices you could walk to and there are not a lot of other hotels nearby so you are kind of stuck.  There are restaurants and a Westfield mall across the freeway, but the short drive takes about 8-10 minutes during dinner.  The first morning I heard delivery trucks behind the hotel at 3:45 am, so that was not fun.  I did request a hill view as I read previous posts about freeway  noise and I think the soundproofing needs a bit of work.  The parking it outside in a plain lot, which is great in the rain right?  Yes it is San Diego, but it does rain sometimes.  I also did not see anyone patrolling the lot so be careful.The pantry area to buy snacks and water was very tiny, and the restaurant pretty basic. The room does not have enough plugs for our modern electronic age and I had to unplug a lamp to use my laptop, then later for the coffee maker to get water for tea as the plug that was dedicated to the coffee maker did not work.I would not choose to stay at this property again, but it was fine for the few nights.",0,0.444047619047619

Substantial breakfast available for 7 Euros, but we preferred to go out and visit one of the numerous stretch cafes where we could get a decent breakfast for the two of us for the same amount.Word of advice - the railway link between the airport and Pisa railway station has been discontinued for major upgrading into an automated shuttle.  In the meantime, there is a bus service between the airport and the station called the Pisa Mover. If you intend to travel from Pisa to the airport by this bus DO NOT wait at the stance outside the station which clearly indicates that is where you get the Pisa Mover.  You actually have to get it from a bus stop across the road from there.  Stood there for ages before we went to the nearby bus office to be told that.

Our room was large with a recently remodeled bathroom, however the rest of the space looked to be awaiting renovation and a new bed.  Tucked in a corner was a very small table (not large enough for anything more that 2 glasses of wine) and two very uncomfortable chairs.  The television was also awaiting an update, but did a very effective job of hiding the holes in the wall where a much older TV must have been.On the first evening we chose to eat at Forte, the Italian restaurant in the hotel. We like to eat early, so made reservations for 6:30, before the restaurant got too busy. Even though the restaurant was not busy, our appetizer took 40 minutes to arrive. The remainder of our meal was not inspirational.

Super friendly and offered suggestions for dining - pointed out all the resort has to offer. My husband stayed at the resort and enjoyed their breakfast and lunch in the diner and the pool area.

392610512,"I debated with myself between a 2 star and 3 star rating because the room was a good size, the water was hot, the TV worked and the staff was friendly. But, since the nearest coffee was a walk to the Convention Center, I relied on the little coffee maker in the room. However, after Day 1, the maid did not leave any more coffee! Perhaps she didn't expect anyone to use it. We ordered a refrigerator our first day, second day and third day. Though they said they'd send one, it never arrived. And there was no microwave. I was there for the Mensa Annual Gathering and most of our programs were in the Convention Center. Somehow we wound up in a room as far away as possible to the Convention Center and, due to various health issues (not obesity or emphysema), the walk was agony. So I missed a lot of programs. Other programs were in rooms where I had to walk up a flight of stairs. A map was needed to find the rooms. On the other hand, there was plenty of seating for all of the programs. Maybe a lot of people just gave up trying to get to them. The food was as cheap as possible though hot dogs were always available. And there was hardly a wait to fill our plates from the buffet tables.  Parking was $5 a night, as if walking anywhere off property were possible. We paid A LOT for the room yet there were all kinds of add-on fees. The grounds were nicely kept. I would have been satisfied if the nightly rate was $50 cheaper.

AVwdIPxpkufWRAb52lqx,"I tend to be pretty loyal to Marriott brands and built up quite a bank of Marriott points, so when I went to book a room in Anaheim for a trip to Disneyland using my points I booked the Towneplace Suites for three reasons: (1) It was a much better value than any of the other Marriott properties in Anaheim, as it was a Category 3 for points redemption while the others were at least a Category 5.(2) It was the only Marriott property in Anaheim that did not charge a daily parking fee. (3) Free continental breakfast. I tend to be pretty cost conscious, so I would much rather fill up on a free hotel breakfast than pay for fast food or worse pay Disneyland food prices.I still had a few doubts, but I went into the stay with an open mind and wasn't disappointed. My biggest concern, the location in relation to Disneyland, ended up being a non-issue. The Anaheim Resort Transit shuttle ran like clockwork and I could be to the parks in less than 20 minutes. At a cost of only 12 for a three-day pass, it was much cheaper than parking at Disneyland and probably a good bit quicker as well. Even though the hotel isn't within walking distance of Disneyland I wouldn't hesitate to book again. The location was also a plus when I went to the Angels baseball game, as the stadium is about a half mile walk from the hotel. The room itself was more than adequate. The full size fridge and kitchenette with a dishwasher and stove was impressive but probably unnecessary for most hotel guests, however with the microwave and stocked dishes it would be very easy to prepare simple meals in the room to avoid the expense of eating out. The sleeping area was a totally separate bedroom which made it feel a little small, but it is probably about the same size as you would find in other Towneplace and other Marriott suite-style hotels. I think it is just the lack of openness that makes it feel small. Everything was nice and clean, no complaints there.I see that someone else complained about the breakfast, but I think it was as good as should be expected for free. I have seen fancier, but during my stay the breakfast included cereal (6 types), bagels, English muffins, yogurt, fresh whole fruit, instant oatmeal, and boxes of raisins (quite honestly I grabbed a few boxes each morning for snacks while in Disneyland). My only criticism would be to wait a little while longer to start shutting the breakfast area down, as 9:30am is still pretty early and most of these folks are on vacation after all.My only other complaint would be the toilet paper. I don't necessarily expect the nicest paper out there, but the stuff in my room was the roughest single-ply toilet paper I've ever seen. I think most gas station bathrooms have higher quality toilet paper than this. It just seems pretty ironic that while there was shampoo and conditioner by Paul Mitchell the hotel couldn't spend a little more for a decent two-ply. Overall I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel for anyone going to Disneyland or to an Angels games, although I may encourage them to bring their own TP.",1,0.5404707545118503

531767611,"Didn't realize until I checked in that I had actually stayed at this hotel 9 years prior.  It looks the same from what I can remember, including the room we were in.  We booked a room with executive lounge access and were assigned a room on the 17th floor.  It's a 1 bedroom with a separate living area which was nice.  Good sized room overall but it did feel a little dated.  The hotel accommodated my request for extra pillows and towels and had them ready when we arrived.  Breakfast in the lounge was good.  They offered several hot dishes like scrambled eggs or cheese omelettes, bacon and sausage as well as hash browns.  There were an assortment of pastries, bread and fruit.  Elevators operated quickly considering there are only 3.  The hotel is connected to a Asian/predominantly Chinese mall.  You can walk about 3 blocks to a typical full size mall where the Sky Train station is also located.  My one gripe with the hotel is with the parking garage.  For one, the sign in the hotel driveway says you need to check with the doorman after 10 to make sure the garage is open.  That was a bit of an annoyance when coming home late.  The garage itself is also very tight and is shared with patrons of the Asian mall so during regular business hours it can get busy and since it's multi level there's a lot of circling around.  You pretty much will always have to drive down to P2 as the P1 is for valet parking and if you come home late and the hotel is full you might as well jsut go straight down to P3.  Besides this minor inconvenience my wife and I were happy with the hotel.  It's about 20-25 min drive from YVR and about 20-25 min drive to Surrey where we were spending some time visiting family.",1,0.430000555000555

130512304,"I stayed here with my boyfriend in May.  The hotel is a short taxi ride from the train station, a 20minute walk from the city centre and another 10 minutes to the tower.  Staff were very friendly and helpful, we were given a cable for our netbook if the wifi connection was too weak in our room (although it was fine).  Our room was on the ground floor, only a few metres from the reception area, although it was generally quite quiet (despite a few loud parties of guests arriving/departing which was disruptive).  Our window was facing the busy road, but is a good few feet off the ground so would be hard to break in.  The safe was in the wall below the window (not where I would put a safe!) but was quite small.  Our netbook would only fit in at an angle, and then there was limited room for everything else.  The wardrobe was big enough, and the bed was annoyingly two single mattresses pushed together, which were very hard.  The bathroom was a decent size.  The worst thing was the lighting - there is hardly any! There are spotlights around the giant headboard, but they shine upwards, so it was hard to read in bed.  The best lit area of the room was the entrance!  Even with all the lights on, and the curtains drawn, our cameras still needed a flash!  One evening my boyfriend headed to the bar to order some drinks, and came back to the room with a tray consisting of proper tea, milk, biscuits and Nutella for only 4 euros.

The website photos make one think that the foyer and the sitting area are huge.  They are in fact small and dark.

We stayed three nights and met a variety of staff.  The cleaning staff and breakfast room staff said &quot;Bongiourno&quot;, but in three days, no one at Reception said Hello,  or even smiled.  They did not even look up from the desk to acknowledge that we were there. I had a to ask a few questions at reception, and each time I had to speak to a head looking down rather than a smiling face.   We came and went many times each day, passing by reception each time.

This hotel is immense and we paid extra for a river view (and I strongly recommend that you do, too) because so much of the experience is the drama of the room and the view.Looking at the hotel we decided that it must have some very non-standard rooms (not a simple box).

There was a TV in our room and free Wi-Fi was available. Probably the best shower I took in all of Italy.  Plenty of hot water and good pressure.The bad: The place is about a half a step above a youth hostel.  If you would like a bathroom in your room you need to make sure you ask for it otherwise you may end up with a shared bathroom.  If you want air conditioning, it costs about 6 euro per day extra.  Also, be aware that although the rates are very reasonable, they charge per person, not per room.  Despite my comment above regarding the shower, the bathroom itself is very narrow, like being in a tight hallway.

I spent a very memorable 3 nights in Quebec City during the Christmas season and the Chateau Frontenac definitely contributed to the magical feeling of that experience. As with all Fairmont Chateau accommodations, your room &amp; ensuite will usually be smaller than other luxury hotels given the restrictions that an old, historic building places on modern designers. Registering for the Fairmont's Presidents' Club will provide you with an expedited check-in and free wifi in your room. The only complaint I had (as with many Fairmonts) is the lack of 24 hour room service. We were provided with a take-out and delivery menu to a local restaurant after our late night arrival - which was fine since they made delicious poutine!",1,0.4763888888888888

It was not a very nice room at all, just a little bit bigger room  with just enough to squeeze in one extra bed.Totally undecorated.  Rather dark, and no balcony. We saw that there were nicer rooms and said that we wanted a nice junior suite, and we were told that we didn't get that becasue that is not avalable to book online. So we had to pay extra to get the room we thought we booked. If I didn't have small kids with me I would never have done that, I would rather have changed hotel. The room we got was nice with a balcony. and two rooms. It is a very large hotel area so if you have problems walking be sure to get a room close the pool. The pool area is great, both for kids and adults. There is a very nice beach just across the street, with a very nice restaurant where they have after beach music, playground etc. But the mosqitos at night were really bad at the beach, one evening we didn't even finish our meal because we had like 50 mosqitos over the table even though we had mosquito spray and the restaurant had special candles.

135505732,"This is a large hotel with two buildings - one with 7 stories, the other (which we were in) with 10 stories.   Most Courtyard hotels, I believe, cater mostly to business travelers.  I heard one of the guest services reps explain to a potential guest that this hotel, because of its location and the area's tourist attractions, caters to families as well.  There is a small pool.  Parking is $16 per day.  There is a large parking lot but only one row of parking has wide spaces - they need at least another row of wide spaces.  Most of the spaces are quite small.  You use a ticket to get in &amp; out of the parking lot.  Our room:  Attractive with good showerhead, comfortable bed, lots of light, plenty of places to plug in chargers.  There were a couple of types of pillows.  The firm ones were a little softer than I like but they were ok.  The air conditioner was louder than we expected in a hotel like a Courtyard.  We were on the back side of the hotel away from the freeway and the weather was cool so we opened the window at night &amp; didn't need to use the air conditioner.  There was only one small round towel rack in the bathroom so the only place to hang bath towels was over the shower rod.   The waste baskets in the room were quite small and what was really odd was that the plastic liner bags were even smaller, making it difficult to use the waste baskets.We checked in on a Saturday and the Wi-Fi was very good until Wednesday evening about 8 pm.  There were too many people logged on &amp; I couldn't get logged on again until much later in the evening.  It was the same on Thursday evening - I wasn't able to get logged on until almost 11 pm. There are 3 computers in the lobby for guests to use and also a separate PC for printing boarding passes.  The bar area of the lobby has 3 flat screen TVs and there is a separate seating area with one large flat screen TV.   Most of the food we had at The Bistro in the lobby was quite good.  There were healthy food items such as oatmeal with nuts &amp; fruit on the side.  My favorite was the healthy breakfast sandwich:  egg whites, turkey Canadian bacon, cheese and spinach on a high quality English muffin.   There were plenty of food choices for lunch and dinner; the only items I tried were the Caesar salad (very good, crisp lettuce with the dressing on the side &amp; good but way too many croutons) and the chicken noodle soup (ok).  Breakfast items were also available all day.  Overall, we were happy with our stay.",1,0.5123284907183213

One of the main reasons for for the 5 star rating is the quality of staff: all the staff members we encountered were exceptionally nice and helpful (which is saying a lot given the region is rightfully known for its hospitality). We were in the least expensive room and it was quite small but this is more than made up for in terms of how beautiful the the room was. Furthermore, the hotel has upstairs and downstairs balconies that are great to sit on at any time of day.

I always try to get one of the rooms with a private hot tub on the balcony.  These rooms are located on the 3rd, 7th, and 8th floors.  They are obviously worth a bit more money, but in the fall they are totally worth the money for a little weekend getaway.  The staff is great and always accommodating.

The atmosphere was regal and romantic; perfect for me and my boyfriend.  There is a darling courtyard with a fountain and a balcony with tables where enjoy a drink while people watching.  Others have said that the rooms are small. Something to keep in mind is that this is an old house, not a modern hotel.  It wasn't built to have large suite rooms. We stayed one night in room 1, where Elvis stayed, and it is indeed on the smaller side. The shower is tiny and I wouldn't recommend it for taller individuals. We loved room 1 regardless of the size. The decor is very grand, with red brocade wall paper and gold accents and chandelier. The bed was very comfortable. It was on the first floor and looked out into the courtyard. On the second night, room 1 was booked (people request it specifically!), so we moved to a room upstairs. I believe it was room 12. Room 12 is much larger with 2 double beds. It was pretty spacious both in the bedroom and the bathroom. Personally, I preferred room 1. I felt the accommodations were great and liked the little touches, like a cookie with turndown service.

The hotel had a nice peaceful courtyard looking out onto the beach, with a some seating areas, a fountain, and even a little shower to wash off any excess sand, which was appreciated.

I usually get a good rate there and the priority club rewards program is one of the best hotel customer rewards programs around.It's an easy walk downtown and there are a number of decent places to eat nearby. You can get there easily from the airport by taking the Canada line skytrain to the Vancouver City Centre stop and then transfer to a bus along Granville for a couple of blocks. You could walk from City Centre to the hotel easily if you don't have too many bags. The Yaletown Roundhouse skytrain stop is also close and slightly downhill from the HI along Davie so I usually only walk there on my way back to the airport.The staff are friendly and efficient and the rooms are fine. Recently they have upgraded the TVs in the rooms (at least in all the rooms I've stayed in) to large LCD models. The old CRT versions were small and crappy, so that was a welcome improvement.

We came back after being out and the one trash can was empied but sittting in the living area, the toilet paper had not been stocked and towels were left on top of our luggage as opposed to hung in the appropriate area, the toilet overflowed the first time we used it. And finally and most disgusting was that a used condom was ound in one of the nightstands (ewww). Now on to the facilities. The levator was out of order one night, unruly and unsupervised children were left to run roughshod over the pool area. We were subjected to splashes in our face, yelling and our belongings being knocked over (staff did not come to check even though everal adults complained). We spent a total of a half hour of our 3 day stay in the whirlppl finally giving up to sit on the sun deck in order to have some peace and quiet. Only issue with staff was when my sister went to the fornt desk to ask for a hand towel so that she could wipe the sweat of her face(August in Virgina is hot as Hades) and the desk personnel told her that they did not have any and gave her a bat mat instead. To reiterate, the entire experience beyond the pleasant staff was horrific... DO NOT STAY HERE!!!",-1,0.488

The attention to detail is evident in the smooth, efficient check-in process.  Our room was not yet ready due to our early arrival; however, arrangements were immediately made to enable me to use their Business Center.The rooms and suites are inviting and incredibly comfortable.  It feels like home, yet on a far grander scale.  On several occasions, it was a difficult decision on whether to go outside to explore the beautiful city or stay inside and bask in the well-appointed surroundings and amenities.The location of the chateau is perfect, within walking distance to the finest restaurants in Quebec City.  Excellent shopping on Rue St. Jean and Quartier Petit Champlain is also nearby.  The funicular in front of the hotel provides easy access to all the activities in Old Port.We enjoyed strolling along Terrasse Dufferin, the public promenade/boardwalk with spectacular views of the lower town and the St. Lawrence River.

Then when lights off my silence was disturbed by him clearing his throat and at 11.20pm unable to stand the noise i went to reception, no more rooms and so i asked for ear plugs which i was given. Woke up exhausted. The man was not noisy but i could hear him as if he was in my room, very disconcerting. The breakfast was disapointing with just a hot breakfast which consisted off scrambled eggs, sausages and beans. Not as good as the premier inns i have stayed at but I think it is better than they used to offer. Staff friendly and helpful and room itself great. Well placed for ASADA, cinema and loads of other shops and of course Glasgow.A good hotel but don't get the adjoining room deal unless you want to have a sleepless night.",0,0.5183333333333332
108204886,"I should have known we were going to have problems when we could not get the wheelchair into the room as there were 2 small but steep steps at the entrance.  The friendly lady who checked us in and smilingly handed my fellow traveler who sat in her wheelchair her room key should have mentioned that this may be a problem.  We did not request a handicapped room as usually hotels do not have steps into the room entrances.  The front desk told us that they could not help us as there were so many requests for handicapped rooms at the last minute that they were out.We had trouble finding a place to eat at the hotel as it is a complex array of paths that are unmarked.  On the map, the paths all seem to have names.  Asked a cleaning lady for directions only to be told, &quot;I don't speak English.&quot;  We found the Garden Trellises Restaurant.  We looked forward to eating yummy food and tried to overlook the high prices on the menu.  But eating stale chips with a $12 chip and dip appetizer did nothing to boost our image of this hotel.  They did finally give us more chips...after we were finished with our lunch.  All the grit in the clam chowder made us feel like we were at the beach.  The waitress told us that she's had no other complaints about the chips or the clam chowder the whole day.  She said maybe she should try the chips first next time(hopefully not from the plates she is going to serve!).We got to the conference room to set up a booth and were told that the hotel double-booked the room so it would not be ready until the time we were supposed to be done setting up.  That all worked itself out.When we got back to our room and were getting changed, a man came bursting in with a key and then asked if we were leaving as this was the room they assigned to he and his wife.  Yes, that made us nervous about the hotel's security.  We were very grateful that we were in the room at the time as we had all our stuff there.Got to the conference okay and finally figured out the maze of paths a bit so feeling more comfortable with getting around.  But came running back to the room only to find out that the key didn't work.  Ran back to the conference to get the other key only to find that the other key didn't work either.  Went to the front lobby (about 10 mins. walk) and was told by the lady that the keys no longer worked because they disabled them so the other couple could no longer get in.  Well, thank you but what about our keys?  She gave me new keys and I was able to get in.  Ordered room service later that night.  The menu plainly said that the entree I ordered included (at no extra charge) a soup or salad.  When I mentioned this as I was ordering, the man said it was an extra $2.95.  I spoke with 3 different people in trying to explain to them that this was wrong only to be transferred back to this same man who said that HIS menu was the new one and what he had to charge me.  So, I was charged an extra $2.95 for my iceberg lettuce with a few tomatoes scattered on the side.  We got used to the constant hum of machinery right outside the door and it probably helped that the ice machine was broken so we didn't hear people getting ice all night.  The skylight in the bathroom had enough lightbulbs so the burnt out one didn't seem to affect the lighting.  Wifi is extra but so are many other places.  I didn't need the alarm clock plugged in so that was the outlet I used as I could not find any other sockets but the ones that were used by the lamp and the clock by the bedside.  The other choice was the one other socket on the other side of the room but that is not where I wanted to sit.  Once I unplugged the clock and got the cobwebs off the plug, it worked fine.  And I didn't see any of the spiders that made such a fine network of webs.The next day, again ran back to the room from the conference only to find that once again, my key didn't work.  I knew better than to get the other key.  I explained my situation to a staff lady there and she directed me to a phone to call.  They said somebody would meet me.  I waited outside the room for about 10 mins. and then got impatient.  I asked somebody else who worked at the hotel and she said to go get another key from the front lobby.  I told her I was not going to walk another 10 mins. to the front lobby as this happened yesterday also.  I think my voice was getting louder as another staff said he would open the door for me (didn't check any i.d.).  About 10 mins. later, a man knocked on my door and said &quot;Oh, somebody must have opened the door for you.&quot;  I told him the key didn't work yesterday but it was because another couple came into our room.  He thought this was funny and burst out laughing.  He then checked the lock and said it was broken.  He said it would take him about 10 mins. to change it but needed to be in the room to do it.  I declined as there does not seem to be an abundance of privacy in this hotel and I am missing it!Sadly, I would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone.  Can you blame me?",0,0.4750034738923627

I just didn't realize HOW special until we got there. I had one of the best hotel experiences in years.We were there for two nights and found the decor to be really lovely. Something unusual and appealing catches the eye no matter where you look. Artifacts such as broken pieces of antique china are encased in illuminated glass boxes inside the walls, giving off a museum-like -- but not stuffy -- feel. The restaurant, Panache, could very well be the inside of a Quebec farmhouse, but one with top-of-the-line furnishings. The bar area is sophisticated and stylish. But none of those things matter if the rooms aren't top notch. No worries there. Our bathroom was luxurious. The bed was an indulgence... so comfortable.

The aircon was very efficient even at low fan speeds. The hotel itself was nicely furnished in a 'Tuscan' style and provided a shuttle service to the station or airport at a nominal cost. The buffet breakfast was adequate although the hot items were always the same (scrambled eggs and some sort of bacon) and there were no plain croissants.

Pisa is small however and you can walk to the other side of the Arno for better choice although it is a good wee walk to the tower.Just beware of mossies at night on the terrace and also if the bathroom window is left open - the only ventilation in our bathroom.Staff were friendly and the hotel had a comfortable relaxed atmosphere and other services are available e.g. free Wi-Fi, bicycle hire.

We went ahead with all her recommendations and were never dissapointed. The map that she gave us which she added on numbers to all the restaurants we wanted to try out and the bus numbers for each destintaion was the best asset for our short stay in Pisa.

362397532,"After reading some reviews, I felt I needed to write one myself. I booked through Airmiles and was given what ever standard room they book for Airmiles. Upon check in (Friday), I asked if we could upgrade the room. For an extra $70 for two nights, we were given a king sized room in the Signature Club building, which was very reasonable. We elected for underground parking to avoid any hassles, but the resort was not full at this time of year so parking would've been a non-issue anyway. The room was clean, modern, had a/c and a great view. With the Signature Club, you get a continental breakfast (best I've had) and free appies pre-dinner. So we really saved money with the upgrade over buying two extra meals each per day. Not a bad deal! The resort is older in parts, for sure, but never run down or anything like that. It's more like a charming ski lodge from the 70's or 80's. We walked the property, swam and checked out the hot tub. All was fine with us. No issues at all. Great food at Woody's! On the Saturday, we asked if there were any rooms with a balcony. It was so warm, we wanted to sit outside at night. We were given a two-level suite with a mountain view and balcony at no extra charge! We were also allowed to keep our Signature status and use the buffet and appies.  It was charmingly dated like old ski lodges at Big White in Kelowna that we skied in the past, so it was just fine. I'm all about clean, and it was clean, so the rest is character and makes for interesting stories (like the deer jumping over spruce tree wall paper in the bathroom). Over all, the food was really good to great every time we ate (one exception with an over cooked appy at Woody's and it was taken off our bill no question or hassle, can't beat that!). The staff were helpful. friendly, attentive and professional. We had an issue with the menu on our TV later at night and the front desk staff let us pick a rental at no charge, can't complain about that. It seemed to us that they did the best they could at every turn. In our case anyway, we would go back in a heartbeat. We brought two dogs with us and I have never seen more dogs in a resort!

When we got to the room (228), there were no linens in the bathroom. We checked with the front desk and they got us replacements almost immediately. Physically getting into the rooms was a big hassle. The electronic key card systems were extremely problematic and it would take 15 swipes to get the lock to activate. (If you're thinking this was isolated, it was not, because friends two doors down were having the same problems). We had the key cards changed out once but this didn't rectify the problem.The beds were firm and supportive (awesome for someone like me with back issues), lots of great pillows (&gt;4 per bed) and great linens. The room through was a little weathered and some of the wallpaper had started to lift in one section of the room. The AC/Heater unit had also had some mileage and the controls were hard to manage. I either froze or was cooked. Couldn't find a happy medium but that maybe me.We forgot to bring a corkscrew so we asked the front desk if we could borrow one. They didn't have one but suggested we ask the staff at the restaurant. The gentleman at the restaurant was very rude and starting ranting at me that I was like the 100th person that had asked. He could have been polite but as such I would never eat there.The continental breakfast which is included is AWESOME! Make-your-own-waffle machine with the batter, danishes, bagels, Texas toast, cranberry &amp; orange juice and fresh coffee plus four different types of cereal - and that's just the tip of the iceberg.

3703143,"Where to even begin, let's start with the $12.00 a day parking fee that they throw at you when you check-in.. Has anybody ever heard of getting charged to park in a hotel parking lot in which you have reservations for? On top of that they charge $15.00 per day occupancy tax yet again adding more to the bottom line when checking in. We decided to rent a movie off of the service that is provided in the room which was a great movie but did not expect to pay $11.00 for it and the $2.00 movie tax they charge on top of that. So what ever your quote is to stay at this hole go ahead and tack on $54.00 and an additional $13 if you rent a movie. I won't even go into how over priced room service was.

The rooms have exposed brick walls, thin down comforters, whirlpool baths (a nice plus) and are decorated in attractive colors.  Breakfast (included with room) is served in a pretty dining room from 7-10 am and you choose from about 10 dishes each morning and they make it to order--things like yogurt and fruit, omlettes, french toast, crepes, and oatmeal.  It is really nice and the server was so bright and friendly each morning.  The only drawback for us was the construction noise nextdoor as they renovate another old building.  They started about 8 am and served as our &quot;wake-up call.&quot;  This is out of the control of the hotel staff, but hopefully they contruction will be done soon.  We loved it!

187641448,"They pretty much have it right. And when they don't, they fix it 'til it is. They don't really need this review. Their excellence has been well-documented by reviewers both here and on other sites. But there were too many moments of wanting to pinch myself that I needed to write'em up! I'll try to keep it brief, :)I went for an overnight stay with my gf to celebrate her birthday using a coupon voucher. Yes, they do coupons, they also seem to have a relationship with spalotto.com; making things more affordable for those on a budget. To address that point, the pricetag does look steep -- and make no mistake, this isn't a value lodge -- but it's not as bad as it first appears. The pricetag includes four multi-course meals (breakfast, lunch, tea time &amp; dinner), includes a hundred something credit for a spa service that's potentially re-imbursable by corporate health plans, credit for a wellness class, and unlimited use of their grounds (pools, tennis court + ball machine [I'm a bit of a tennis nut], steam/sauna rooms), and unlimited drinks (coffee, tea &amp; flavoured waters) and granola! Spoiler: expect great things from their granola. Overall, you get what you pay for here, IMHO, and thensome, making this an awesome value, hence the reason why they're #1 in the country. Now, the details...Facilities:Stayed offsite at one of their houses (Eagle's Nest). Nice and clean, no issues with getting shuttle rides to/from the house when needed. Working fireplace, high ceilings, spacious rooms. They didn't have the room ready when we arrived, but that's likely because we got there before the official checkin time; despite that, they were still apologizing profusely for their tardiness. Their main house had beautiful views of Lake Ontario, so waiting for the room wasn't a problem. Trails across rolling hills would lead into some interesting forests &amp; streams, we saw a woodpecker!The steam rooms &amp; pools that we tried were nice, clean, and functional (i.e. hot water was hot, not warm). Their piece-de-resistance was their Eucalyptus steam room: if there ever was such a thing as a healing chamber, this would be it, :P We could've stayed in there forever.Food:Their dining room has a wonderful view, they rotate our table location for every meal, giving everyone a chance to sit by the window. We were lucky enough to get the window seat during lunch, when there was the most light. One word: breathtaking!While I'm not really one to know haute cuisine, I would consider their food haute cuisine. But you get filled up too, like at a buffet, but better quality food.The sad and great thing about our stay, was that there was so little time to experience everything the spa offers for our overnight, that you sometimes end up being time-crunched. We ended up being a bit late for our breakfast &amp; lunch times, but there was no problem getting us in and providing the full experience. We were worried we had to give up our lunch dessert to get to our couples massage on time, so when they matter-of-factly provided take-out containers for our dessert course that we didn't even start, they earned their gold stars, then and there.People:Without reservation, this is what defines this Spa. You can have destinations that have the best food, the winningest facilities/location, but if your peoples (and their service) is sub-par, you're not going to get far. (Yes...I had to quit the underground rap scene...it was getting too commercial).We were likely nowhere close to their worst patrons, but we likely weren't their easiest. Neither of us have stayed here overnight, so we were clueless on what to expect. There were plenty of questions, as well as demands, as this was supposed to be a surprise stay for my gf; so reservations, notifications, reward point allocations, all needed to be handled a bit different from normal. The staff handled it all gracefully; patient with every question, request, comment or backstory that we had throughout our stay.It's crazy how the word &quot;no&quot; is seemingly missing from their vocabulary, or how they never learned to frown. But it's not like they're barbie &amp; ken dolls: they talk like people (just really positive people), about their families, their experiences, etc. It sort of makes you think of sending them your resume...:PMisc:You can mostly tell from the way the business owner replies to the negative reviews they receive here (unlike others I've come across), that they're heavily invested, and truly committed, to making every customer experience a 5-star experience. In our situation, there were some issues with the communication of the deal package (what we initially received wasn't what was stated in the coupon details), leading to some extra payment. I sent in an email with some feedback, sent on a Sunday night (around 9pm) , and less than an hour later, a reply was received from the Operations Director (to be fair, the feedback was sent directly to him &amp; others) that got the ball rolling towards a credit of that extra payment. The refund was nice, but the standout act was: who checks their work email at 9 pm on a Sunday AND replies back within the hour?!There's a lot more I can elaborate on, but I promised to be brief. So in closing, kudos to this business for having the zenith of product, service and environment in the Spa industry.

We did a lot of walking and enjoyed ending up with a downhill return each day.    I can't imagine anyone not falling in love with this great spot.  The rooms are newly appointed with modern fixtures and furnishings.  Reminded us of the finest hotels in Montreal and Lyon France.  There is a cute little balcony with most rooms.  It doesn't allow seating and while we did look out to a cruise ship on our visit, it is nice to have the door open and fresh air at night.   The city was even fairly quiet with the door open at night.    Would definitely recommend this to discerning travelers.",1,0.6081930415263749

The cost to stay here is high compared to other local hotels. But then again you kind of have to expect that with a Fairmont and a hotel like this.  Our room was clean and a good size, but I wouldn't call it 'Luxury' by any stretch of the imagination. I found it very nice, but average.  The historical aspects of this hotel are very nice and a must see. Although, I wouldn't pay for a tour... The location of this hotel cannot be be beat. It is so central to Old Quebec and short walking distance to the shops and tours.The check-in was quick and efficient, no complaints there. The staff was friendly.We opted for the valet parking, as Self-Parking in Old Quebec is an excursion on its own. This service as very slow, and could take up to 25 minutes to get your vehicle (normally, I expect around 5-10 minutes for Valet service).The restaurants and bars in this hotel are over priced. We had breakfast at Place Dufferin both mornings of our stay, and had an incident with the waiter. The incident was not with our table, but we could hear the waiter complaining and making remarks about every table he was serving, in French, to another waiter. I believe he thought that no body around spoke French, but we are fluently bilingual... The remarks he said were VERY inappropriate and although not right for any restaurants, you definitely do not expect that in a restaurant in a Fairmont Hotel.

It consisted of a croissant and tea/juice delivered to your room. We took it to the courtyard and ate there.

It was like being in New York, traffic all night, Friday night revelers shouting, and when I finally got some peace - around 5am - the bin men started.Dinner was awful.  I ordered steak with a pepper sauce and frankly it looked more like gravy than pepper sauce.  I sent the first one back and another arrived - similarly awful.  I sent that back as well and the waiter was almost surprised that I didn't like it - I even offered to go and show the chef how to cook a proper sauce!!A member of our group arrived at 9.35pm and joined us at the table.  We asked if she could chose from the menu but were told that the kitchen closed at 9.30pm.  They were not in the least bit helpful.  I was amazed at their lack of customer service.  My guest had travelled up from London and was offered a pudding!!  The funny thing is that there appears to be an extensive room service menu that you can have in your room until 10pm but you can't get anything in the restaurant.  I offered to go and call room service for my guest but she declined.Since I was leaving at 8am I had asked the receptionist if I could order some breakfast from the room service menu.  She advised that they do not start until 8am on a Saturday but she said the chef was in from 7am and she would make sure I got some food before I left.  I put the card on the door and 7.45am came and went and even when I was checking out at just gone 8am there was still no sign of any breakfast.Its expensive for what it is, the reception staff were helpful but ineffective!

The bathroom was spotless but small. Our window looked into an internal lightwell so we had no view to speak of. Breakfast was included, and there was a reasonable choice, but the room was very crowded and hectic. The staff were very helpful, and provided help in finding restaurants that would be open on a Sunday, including one nearby. Overall the hotel was a good choice for people stopping in Pisa on the way to/back from Florence. There is a limited amount to do in Pisa though so one night here is adequate.",0,0.3790793650793651

234775052,"The Town and Country Resort and Convention Center has some beautiful grounds and swimming pools but the rooms and management are something else. We were there with about 400 others for a convention.  I made my reservation directly with the hotel about five months in advance for a room in the Royal Palm Tower; the convention price was $109 per night for the seven nights.  When we arrived we were told the property had been recently sold and new management had taken over.  The price for a tower room would now be an additional $60 per night because it was now considered a &quot;premium&quot; room.  I protested to no avail and took the &quot;premium&quot; room because I had been told the bungalow rooms were very small.   The &quot;premium&quot; room had a sliding glass balcony door off its track, a TV cabinet door with a bad hinge that would not stay open and had to be propped open to view the TV, a missed-matched coffee maker and pot, (the coffee over-flowed the coffee basket on to the counter and not into the pot), a 50's style hair dryer that would not work, a plugged toilet, a wad of long black hair on the shower wall that was wiped up from the bottom of the tub, several burned-out light bulbs, only one hand towel in the bath room, and well worn/scared furniture and dirty carpet.  Mind you now that this building had reportedly been recently renovated but the water stained wall paper in the bath room and the condition of the furniture told a different story.  To their credit, whenever I reported a problem with the room, management had it fixed rather quickly. The hotel hosted a one hour get-together with hot hors d'oeuvres but the food ran out in twenty minutes. The breakfast room was poorly prepared for a large group of guests and under staffed.  It was if they were never told that the hotel was booked to near capacity.  The convention facilities were spacious and clean.  This resort is minimally ADA compliant and the outside hallways are open to the public from the near by shopping center which is a security concern.  I would not recommend this property under any circumstances.",-1,0.4506381790252757

140540098,"I recently attended a conference here while staying with a friend so thought I would stay here the next time I came to San Diego. I used to stay here from time to time and was surprised to find how downhill it has gone. I remember large spacious rooms but it looks as if the rooms have been cut in half. Strange size room for Southern California- reminded me of a Japanese business hotel or train compartment. Small cramped, dark, smelly rooms making it difficult for two people to function without bumping into each other. The dark claustrophobic decor looked fairly new but the taste was outdated; cleanliness questionable. We were instructed to unload &amp; schlep our luggage because our room was off the lobby and then go back and park our car somewhere. Parking in their huge empty parking lot is an extra $15 per night. A convenience of this hotel is being able to park by your room and unload luggage. I requested a room we could park in front of, as this huge hotel seemed virtually empty (a bad sign in August), I did not think it would be troublesome for the receptionist to pick another room on the computer. The smell of mildew in the room they gave us was overpowering. We asked for another room, we did not need the pool, we just wanted quiet. We were then &quot;upgraded&quot; to a &quot;garden patio&quot; room. Same tiny size, same decor, same bad smell but with added view (and smell) of the hotels garbage dumpsters, the loud 24/7 humming of  the all the electrical equipment that runs the hotel and yes a 4 foot strip of grass that was loudly mowed first thing in the morning. An interesting parade of employees driving large maintenance vehicles streamed past our window. If they have good rooms we were unable to get one after 3 attempts.There are much better and less expensive hotels in hotel circle for business people and tourists who do not expect anything fancy just decent. I used to enjoy staying here many years ago but it has really become substandard and has way too much nearby competition to get away with it.

The concierge made an excellent recommendation for a dinner dance cruise, saving us some money and providing a much better experience.  Customer service was friendly and efficient, and the restuarants were decent.   The hotel was prepared for our arrival, made special transportation arrangements for us, and we were able to truly enjoy our stay - one morning I slept in until noon as it was so quiet, and this never happens at hotels for me!    I did sense it catered more to business travelers than vacation travelers, however, this does not deter me from returning and may in fact hav enhanced the paceful atmosphere and great customer service.

Opposite are a series of entrances to different privately owned beach facilities.  At the nearest (Paradiso), hotel guests can enjoy a 16% discount on food and beverages if they present a discount card available from the hotel reception.The rooms are relatively basic and the bathroom facilities a little dated but, as other reviews mention, the hotel really is spotlessly clean.  The breakfast was excellent: plenty of choice in a spacious dining room (which unusually has a table pre-allocated for each room). The hotel was notably quiet with only a few rooms occupied when we stayed (midweek in early June).  Other guests seemed to be business travellers more than tourists.

What was very disappointing was the staff, we had a great but long hot day on Elba travelled to the hotel just wanting a cold beer and some food in a relaxing environment, what we got was a completely uninterested restaurant staff, we ordered a beer each to have half the bottle thrown away, we could only think the young lady was new but when we tried to explain the manager he couldn't be bothered to help which was so bad it was rude. We never got offered anything, from this point they struggled to put 2 words of politeness or professionalism together. What was noticeable was an Italian couple were treated very well, take what you wish from that, but after a 25 minute wait for the cheque we nearly walked off. This let the hotel down and ruined our experience. We complained to reception who looked concerned but baffled.  The food was good, pricey but good. We didn't eat again at the hotel.

154832081,"The first contact with the hotel was a bit hectic. I arrived very late (after 11pm) after a dreadful and neverending trip (10hrs delay due to 5cm of snow...) from Paris. Of course the restaurant was closed but the bartender managed to serve some food for us. She could speak limited English but was very attentive and kind. As I was travelling with my daughter, I had booked a twin bed deluxe room. Unfortunately, the room was a double bed one, so I had to go back to the reception, and ask for a twin bed room. We were then moved to a twin room at the ground floor, which was not a deluxe room. As it was midnight, I chose to sleep there and check with the reception during the morning of the second day. After a small talk with the reception, which were very listening and understanding, I was moved to a 3rd room which corresponded to what I booked. The room was nice, with a comfortable bathroom (shower and bathtub), and a dressing room. I liked the dressing room because you can put your luggage there, and keep the bedroom nice and organized. The bed was comfortable, but I found the quilt a bit thin. The beauty products were pretty standard, nothing fancy, and certainly not anything to the level of a 5 stars hotel. The breakfast buffet was pretty nice, again, personnel was nice, smiling and attentive. I am a tea drinker, and I know Italy is not the best place to enjoy a good tea, but I think the hotel could offer better than standard Twinnings or Lipton tea. Same with jams, by the way. Very, very average. Definitely not to the standards of a 5 stars hotel, not even a 3 stars. Too bad because the rest of the buffet was pretty good. The location is pretty good, rather in the outskirts of Pisa, but since I had a car, it was not a real issue. I did not try to reach the historical center of Pisa by foot, but I guess it is feasible. All in all it was an enjoyable experience. The hotel is modern, nicely decorated, and with a very nice and friendly staff. Rooms are comfortable. As for amenities, well, it depends. If we consider Abitalia Tower Plaza as a 5 stars hotel, amenities are definitely not up to the standards, if we consider it as a 3 stars hotel (more in line with the prices), I would say it is average, with some nice touches, but also some minor flaws (like the quality of beauty products or breakfast buffet).",1,0.5683497536945815

The room also has a small balcony.Our one-bedroom unit was comfortable and clean.  The kitchen area was well-organized and complete.  Our unit was great for the two of us, but would work well for a couple with one or two children (hide-a-bed).  It might be a bit tight for two couples.We were on the 7th floor, so noise from down below was softened.

47580744,"We were departing from Pisa airport and needed a hotel in the city.  However San Ranieri was neither in the city centre nor at the airport.  And a trip into Pisa or the airport costs around 10Euro, so I guess if you have your own transport or don't mind travelling by cab this hotel is okay.I've read elsewhere that the hotel restaurant has a good reputation, but from my experience the menu is rather &quot;over fancy&quot; for an out of town hotel.  Sometimes a beautifully crafted simple pasta dish is all that people require, rather than an expensive piece of art on a plate.We ordered from room service, and sadly this was not as requested, but it was late at night, and we didn't complain.Rooms are futuristic and spacious.  Some minor decor issues with a crack on the floor and some touch-up painting may need to be done.Staff are okay.  They did sort out a shuttle bus to the airport for us.

I also find it appalling that I would be charged for the minimal damage done to the sign.   This was clearly an accident and was not intentional.   Moreover, we found all of your employees to be brusque and not atall welcoming.   At the very least we expected friendly and courteousservice, but at no point was that the case.

AVz6h463LD2H7whiYPOd,"If you are looking for a hotel with a cool Miami-style vibe in a central location, this might be the place for you. The hotel is located right on the main drag (Duval street) so it's close to restaurants, drugstores, bars, etc. You can walk to everything from the hotel. The downside to the location is that it is close to Duval. We were in a room that was close enough to Duval that you could hear partying way into the night. After having difficulty sleeping the first night (noise until about 3 am) we asked to moved the next morning, the person at the front desk entertained the idea but was not able to come through. An apology or at least some empathy would have been nice (for example, Oh, I'm sorry the noise kept you up). That was not the case. The response was, At least you're not in rooms xxx and xxx because those are right on Duval. Not what I expected from a place like this and also because we are platinum members of the hotel chain. The pool area is small but lovely with its zen motif and trees in the background. The rooms were also pretty hip and the toiletries very nice. The hotel staff was fine...cordial..but not friendly or terribly accommodating. The free breakfast perk for platinum members was a parfait (fine but not up to par with other hotels in the brand). I might have taken the points and paid for the breakfast instead. At the least they should give you a credit to apply to something else. The bikes on the property were GREAT! We also enjoyed outstanding drinks at the stylish hotel bar. Overall, we had an enjoyable stay and would probably choose the hotel again the next time we are in the keys.

We thought we'd book this hotel as it was associated with Gretzky's name..or so we were told. Thought it would be a nice hotel..but we were wrong from the get-go. The front desk clerk told my daughter our rooms were not ready despite her having booked them months in advance. When asked a simple question which required a simple answer, and then politely asked to repeat the answer, the front desk clerk became abruptly irate and extremely rude. Maybe she was having a bad day? We called for the manager as this was no reason to treat paying customers this way. The manager who was kind and professional..sent her away from the desk and dealt with us directly..also gave us free use of warming trays for the party food we brought in. We were upset but no big deal as we just wanted to get to our room and relax.However, I do have to give an honest review of the state of this hotel. It was absolutely filthy. Food trays from guests were still there in the hallways into the evening. You could tell the carpets were dirty, grimy and not vacuumed. They needed a deep cleaning and to be vacuumed on a regular. Halls had a dirty, moldy type smell to them. Rooms were just okay, nothing special. This hotel is badly in need of updating.

The hotel has a fitness centre and a pool but we did not have the time to enjoy them because there were too many beautiful buildings and scenes to explore.

164839629,"Let me first say I hate LA. I have been a few times and I never know what area I should stay in, where I should head to for food, where I should have a drink at night etc. It is a big sprawling city which varies greatly in its districts. Decided to situate myself near the Grove/Farmers Market this time taking my partner for her first trip here. Turned out to be a great decision, and this hotel is as close as it gets.So many restaurants at The Grove and a few little bars in the Farmers Market mean in you do not feel like heading out somewhere you can walk 2 minutes across the road and you have plenty of selection. Also there is a bus stop across there which goes direct 10 minutes to along Hollywood Boulevard and to its two train stations - where Universal Studios can be reached from. Also there is a stop for the Hop on Hop off bus which if you are an international tourist you will probably use. And finally if you care about star spotting (I do not), pretty much every morning they film the Extras show at the Grove and you can just walk over there and see famous people being interviewed by Mario Lopez for the next nights show. We saw Will Ferrel, Michael Weatherly and Christina Aguilra. As for the hotel, it is a revamped motel. Very hipster in its style. I thought it was cool and the fact it was an old Motel did not at all detract from its comfortableness or cleanliness. Room was quiet, nice, spacious and clean - no complaints at all.

Nice clean modern room with USB power points and lots of plugs and good selection on TV. Anytime I've stayed in an Ibis hotel the bathroom seems to be an all on one modular type plastic room. Usually perfect but after a shower in our particular room (230) the whole floor was soaking and took ages to dry off. Also at the end of the corridor in our room we found the wifi signal quite weak.

In fact, there were a few examples of âstyle over practicalityâ, not least the bathroom itself, which was housed in a glass box within the main room. Looks good, but donât expect much privacy! Thankfully the toilet was separate without glass walls.Overall, I was happy with the service and the stay, and notwithstanding those minor issues, I would stay here again.</span><span class=""taLnk ulBlueLinks moreBtn"" onclick=""widgetEvCall('handlers.clickExpand', event, this);"">More</span>",1,0.5220279475426536

He was a lovely host who helped us at every turn, be it advising us where to grab a much needed beer and pizza after a long drive, where to go for a perfect cappuccino in the morning, or where to go locally for a good trip out. He sent us to the places he said he liked to go, and we weren't ever disappointed. We visited over Easter, so the town was quiet with a lot of places closed the whole time we were there, but Sergio didn't point us towards a single dud. Lovely guy, who keeps a beautifully decorated and furnished B&amp;B. Loads more style compared to lots of other places I've seen or heard about in Italy. Amazing original stone floor in our room.Sergio provides fresh pastries and bread for the morning, which is a lot better than the usual melba toast in a packet you get elsewhere (although I think he has that too). B&amp;B is well placed to get to by car from the main road but doesn't feel at all close to anything busy. There's loads of one way streets which makes it interesting but there's a street next to the B&amp;B that's free to park on. Sergio will show you. Very close walk to the sea front where you can see Sicily and grab an amazing coffee. Equally close to some of the main parts of the town with shops, bars and restaurants.  We felt really welcomed and looked after and would always recommend this place. If you're thinking about booking then I know it helps Sergio if you contact him directly rather than going through an agent as they take a sizeable chunk of the price. We'd definitely go back and hopefully will be later in the year.",1,0.4830357142857142

But I'll settle for &quot;acceptable.&quot; - which it could be , even with minimal expense by owners. Right now its &quot;indifferent&quot; and &quot;unsettling&quot;.

My room  just screamed &quot;we don't care.&quot;  Holes in the wall, holes in the furniture,  ancient furniture that emitted clouds of dust, a mini fridge left unplugged with a worrisome smell leaking out... this is all stuff that can be resolved in an afternoon.  The staff was friendly, I imagine they must be frustrated as well.I wouldn't bother with  a review except for this: I want this place to be better. It just was so far below my minimum expectations I simply can't recommend it. If the owners or the new management company (Rodeway Inn) reads this : I want you to be great , like your name, like the road you are on. But I'll settle for &quot;OK&quot;.

That's it, no strenght workout, or any workout whatsoever. (what you see on the pictures is the complete gym!!)The roofgarden..... Uhm, which one? A big empty roof is not a roofgarden.... The swmingpool was cosy, but no poolboy around. After two days the water was dirty,and after 4 days you couldn;t see the bottom anymore. (the walls became green!!). When complaining the told us it must have been the wind blowing dirt in the swimming pool. Yeah right....But, besides all this, the hotel was good. Very nice and clean rooms with big screens tv and free wifi (very annoying to have to log in everytime....). Hotelstaff was friendly  but don't expect them all to speak english. Breakfast was very impressive for an Italian hotel. Lots of cake, pie, more cake and some fruit and saltless bread. And did i mention pie and cake? Ow, and don''t order a hard boiled egg.... they will charge you Eur 6 ($8,50) for it!Drinks and food in restaurant are very expensive as well. Because of this most people brought their own drinks with them to the swimming pool. â¬5,- for Cola or cappucino is,to put it mildly, completely absurd.

The chair issue made the stay uncomfortable - additionally, it was a swivel tub like high chair, which was very uncomfortable after being on one's feet all day.I had a third floor room overlooking the street.  There was not a peep from the other guest rooms but the noise of traffic (all night) resounding through the walls and double glazing made it difficult to sleep.

After not being happy with the lack of privacy in our first room, we looked at an additional two units (the front desk staff were very courteous about this). We found out from the bellman that all of these units are in the corners of the building, and all have the same lack of privacy.  If you're sitting in the chairs by the window, the other units are so close, and are angled in such a way, that I'm sure our neighbours could read the book I was reading.  So, we had a fantastic view of the mountain, but kept our curtains closed while in the room for privacy.  For us this a massive disappointment, we didn't come to ski, we got out a and did a few things, but we mainly came for a romantic weekend, and were in our room quite a bit...sitting in the dark room dimly lit by lamps. One thing to note with this room category, it says that the view &quot;varies&quot;, and they really do mean it...we had a great view of a mountain, but one of the suites we looked at was right over the hotel entrance with cars coming and going.  The room itself was dated and well worn- bangs and dents in furniture, and the slope on the couch was so bad, we had to crush pop cans to put under the front legs to prop the couch up so it sat level.  The ottoman had some sort of furniture tack sticking through it, when I rubbed my leg against it, it ripped a hole in my thermal pants- very upsetting!  The room is massive, and the room and all public areas were very clean.  The amenities immediately surrounding the area are amazing.  They keep a cleaned short path around the hotel which has great views.  The trails surrounding the hotel for walks/snowshoeing etc. are beautiful.  This is an amazing location.The room service varied quite a bit.  I think the hotel was less busy the first night, and our dinner was perfect.  The remaining two nights were not as great- forgotten salad, missing ingredients (the chocolate raspberry crÃ¨me brulee had chocolate in it the first night, the next time it was forgotten).We couldn't get the Wi-Fi to work, on either of our phones.  The front desk said it should be working, but we just ended up using data.We're really torn about whether we'll come back to this hotel.  It was beautiful, and we loved the outdoor amenities...but the lack of privacy was so unbearable for us.

The Hotel Bologna was delightful, from its glittering exterior, to the relaxing and helpful Reception, the comfortable, spotless and tastefully decorated room, and the delicious and varied breakfast.The room, while of the usual size of a city hotel, was of a much higher quality than expected. The en suite bathroom had no bath, but a large shower and was spotlessly clean. The staff were very nice, polite and greeted us with a smile. The terrace area was an added bonus and it was nice to relax and have a drink there after a day's sightseeing before getting ready to go out and sample Pisa's tasty cuisine.The hot chocolate served in the hotel is superb, and the shuttle service to the airport and train station was really convenient and welcome.The Leaning Tower, Duomo and Baptistery are about 20 mins walk from the hotel and about 10 mins walk from the train station. The hotel is in a quiet area of the city, so a good night's sleep should be had by anyone staying here.Having said this, do take time to have a walk around Pisa itself.

Not only was Monica quick to take it up for me, on my last morning, as soon as she heard me open my room door, there she was to help me with my luggage downstairs again. I refused her help because I had my strength back by then, but she quickly carried it to my taxi, when it arrived, not waiting a moment to allow me to do it myself.With such a lovely, warm-hearted person, you will not be disappointed here. Quite the opposite.",1,0.5148148148148147
14697662,"Two of us stayed at the Hilton Whistler resort for two nights at the end of March 2008 in a two bedroom suite.  I have also stayed at this hotel a couple times previously in a regular hotel room.  For comparison, I have stayed at several other hotels in Whistler including the Westin and Fairmont.  The other places are nice but this place is nicer and after our last stay we are making it our regular place to go for our annual ski trip.The most notable attributes that this hotel excels in are the location, the comfortably furnished rooms,  and the friendly service.The hotel is located about a one minute walk from the gondolas at the bases of both Blackcomb and Whistler mountains.  Each morning we picked up our skis from the ski valet and within a couple of minutes of walking out the door we were on our way up the mountain.  Lugging heavy skis and walking in ski boots can be aggravating when your hotel is further away from the lifts so the excellent location is a big factor in favour of this hotel.The rooms were spacious and comfortable with nice furnishings.  The regular rooms at this hotel when I stayed in the past were quite nice.  The two bedroom suite we had this time was superb.  The suite included a kitchen with high-end appliances, large flatscreen TV and even its own steam/sauna room.  I have stayed in nice places before but this particular suite was a cut above any that I have experienced.  It is most important for me to get a good sleep and in this respect I had a comfortable bed, a silent room, complete darkness from the drapes, and good temperature control in the room.  These features are essential for me as a usually sleep poorly in hotels.We found the service was nice and friendly.  Everything went smoothly at check-in.  One nice feature was the plate of warm cookies they kept at the front desk so we repeatedly found a reason to go by there.  Servers at the restaurant (we had one breakfast and one dinner there) were attentive.  My friend is a wine connoisseur and our waitress for dinner was able to keep pace with him on a detailed discussion of the wine list so I was pretty impressed although most of this went over my head.Breakfast was nice but I can't comment on the breakfast buffet as I ordered a la carte.  Dinner was very good with the menu and wine list focusing on west coast offerings.There was a bar at this hotel which seemed to be hopping both nights but as we were tired we passed on this.After each day's skiing we hit the outdoor hot tub.  People we met there were quite friendly and everyone seemed to be having a good time.  There was also an outdoor pool which we did not use but others were enjoying it.  The gym appeared to be well equipped although it seems to me insane that people go to Whistler and work out in a gym when there is a ski hill next door.Normally my TripAdvisor reviews include a rundown of the pros and cons of each place.  I don't have anything to point out about this place that needs improvement.  Overall we had a great ski trip and we will be back in 2009.",1,0.5760723443223444

Having that said, the lobby is beautiful, staff friendly, and the service they offer is fabulous.  I can only imagine what the rooms must look like.  The original portion of the hotel was opened in 1893, when chateau style hotels were being built for the wealthy clientele of the railroads.  The 20-story central tower was completed in 1924.

The room quality was great, the bathroom in particular was very high standard. Breakfast was brilliant, buffet style with everything you could think of for breakfast. Even potato waffles and pancakes! The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is the traffic noise. We wanted a room that overlooks the road so we could see all the action on the street.

172577952,"We recently stayed and had our wedding at Leaside Manor, and it went off without a hitch. This was quite a feat given that one of us is located in Vancouver and the other in Washington, DC. Our sincere and heartfelt thanks to the staff, and especially Cindy! Most of our correspondence with Cindy was through email.  We only met Cindy, in person, a week before our wedding, and both of us had the utmost faith upon meeting her that things would be perfect. Colin was also instrumental in having things run smoothly on our special day.  Our wedding guests stayed at Leaside Manor, or the neighbouring Compton House.  The rooms are all very individualized and exceptionally clean. The Parker Suite is absolutely beautiful (traditional), while some other rooms are very modern.  The rooms are so much more unique than a traditional (boring) hotel room. In the summer, Iâd suggest a room with air conditioning.  Some of the rooms also had heated floors, but it was too warm to use, but must be ideal during the winter. Also, some rooms have separate entrances (3 rooms in Leaside, and at least 1 room in Compton), which was very convenient for unloading the car. We loved being able to have our breakfast delivered to our room (which we did), or in the dining room (which we also did).  The breakfasts are NOT to be missed! The staff will accommodate special food requests (e.g., instead of the Western omelette, one of us had scrambled eggs).  Book rooms early to ensure availability/disappointment. The Manor is also a short drive/walk from Water Street (the heart of downtown St. John's).Our wedding was very small â 11 guests, so we had our dinner in the dining room (which seats 14).  Evan, the Manorâs chef, achieved perfection with every dish. We had the wedding in the yellow Kilcombe room which was lovely and bright. That room has two beautiful fireplaces which provided a nice backdrop for signing the register. We took lots of pictures in the Manor, as well as outside in the beautiful garden and bright adirondack chairs.  We also thought the prices for our wedding (food, wine and spirits, room rental, etc.) were very fair. We are a same-sex couple, and we would recommend both Leaside Manor and Newfoundland for a wedding. We never experienced the slightest awkwardness being a same-sex couple â only genuine sentiments of the importance of equality.We couldn't imagine not staying at Leaside Manor on our next visit to St. John's!",1,0.6195079365079367

Also in close proximity to the cruise terminal and the stop for new hop on/off tourist bus. The hotel itself is quaint but with modern interior. Our room was very spacious, with the bed tastefully partitioned from the rest of the room to provide the apartment feel.

168587042,"The hotel is a large complex of buildings and covers a lot of area. To be fair, I only stayed in two of the towers, the Royal Palm Tower and the Regency Tower. Parts of the grounds with 2 story older apartment type structures appeared to be well maintained and the overall interior grounds area were quite nice. However, I stay with the masses in he towers. The parking lot is a large lot in the back of the property. This is the type of lot that might make you wonder &quot;is my car safe out here&quot;? Despite the appearance we had not problem and were not aware of any. I arrived about 9 PM for my reserved room with 2 queen beds. I was told they did not have any avail and do not guaranty the room type. (The staff was great, friendly, helpful, &quot;comp&quot;d my parking) . We had to settle for a King bed and a very uncomfortable roll away in the Royal Palm Tower. The room was large, clean but dated. We were given a room that we had reserved for the 2nd night. We moved our belongings to the new room in the Regency Tower. This tower is definitely a step down from the Royal. It seems older, not as well maintained, and the rooms and bathroom were smaller. This could be a great older hotel with better maintenance of the rooms, updated painting, updates to the exterior grounds, etc.... Not horrible but definitely more of a budget hotel.  I definitely would not want to stay in the Regency Tower again if I did return. This hotel will have a hard time competing with newer hotel chains.

The staff were very good, room was clean and spacious, breakfast was pretty good too. However, the hotel is showing its age/neglect. Examples:-The gym is ridiculously small, 3 people in there make for a very crowded setup. 1 treadmill was out commission the elliptical too and I think another TV was out. There are weights and mats but no where to lay the mat really since the people walking to the pool have to walk through the gym to get there.The pool - the lap pool is nice, but good luck getting there if you don't want to walk through the gym, and up like 25 crowded steps. The whirlpool is out of commission &quot;until further notice&quot;.The bathroom - the shower leaks out the side and the bath doesn't hold the water, but seeps out slowly...The living room - the pull out sofa creaks like crazy and kept waking me up.Basically, it's a perfectly fine hotel _trying_ to live up to the Hilton standards.

302095392,"This boutique hotel with 28 rooms is located in the historical lower area of Old Quebec.  It is two minutes walk to the shopping, restaurants and the funicular.  The building is old and they have made it amazing with chic modern furnishings and lighting but have still left the exposed brick in places.  The bed was very comfortable, due to the small size of everything in Old Quebec, queen size only.  The room set up is unique with the bathroom sink in the main room.  These are 400 year old buildings and the designers have to be creative to get everything we expect today in a small space.  Bottom line, it works!  Even better than the location and the cool chic feel are the staff.  The front desk are great, they seem genuine that hey want you to have a good day with your excursions in the old town.  Lots of suggestions, lots of help, help with the language too but all are fluent in at least French and English.  An example: we had a single led lightbulb out.  They couldn't replace it that evening.  It was important in that it was the only light in the bathroom but we could make do without it.  They left us a bottle of champagne on ice in our room with a note explaining why the light bulb wasn't fixed.  Wow.  Alexandre in the breakfast restaurant was very attentive and pleasant.  We enjoyed practicing our French with her and she was very patient.  She even wrote a note to take with us with a couple of phrases to help us.  E food is amazing.  Fresh fruit, croissants as big as footballs (almost) eggs, bacon, potatoes etc.  coffee and lattes made to order.  We are already planning our next trip back to this hotel.

The bed and pillows were very comfortable as well.We enjoy the music in the lobby in the evenings, and even had an excellent dessert one night after returning from dinner.  Other the that dessert, we really didn't dine in the hotel.  There were too many places we wanted to try and which had been described by TripAdvisor and recommended by our concierge.

Overall it's very good value, well maintained and very friendly staff. Nothing in Brantford is a far drive, but closeness to rink and many dining option was a plus. I have not stayed in many Best Westerns as they are a similar price point to some of the business/value hotels of the bigger chains I typically use in my business travels. My only complaint, which is common in older/value properties, is the room was extremely dry. They really need to invest in some in room humidifiers to catch up with some the newer/similar priced hotels in nearby Hamilton.

She told us there was nothing on file and all of her rooms were fully booked.  When I handed her my confirmation receipt from Travelocity she proudly announced (after much squinting and at the computer screen) that we were in the system after all.  When we got up to our room on the second floor I seriously contemplated sleeping in the car.  The carpet was old, stained and scary.  The room smelled like a combination of mildew and urine.  (The smell hits you as soon as you open the door)  The sheets were clean but the comforter was stained and disgusting.  The furniture was filthy and the bathroom was small and cramped.  (This coming from someone who lives in the city.  I'm used to small bathrooms) The shower was crumbling and smelly.  I suggest wearing your flip-flops at all times.

Reception was bright and breezy, quick and with friendly, helpful staff. The room, one of their 'classic' was a decent size with complimentary tea, coffee, bottled water etc. Nightime - the bed was extremely comfortable and there was no noise from adjoining rooms or the corridor outside; there was just slight noise from the busy street below (we were on the 4th floor) which did not disturb us greatly. We had a small problem with the hand basin in that the plug would not disengage. Reception very quickly sent a maintenance operative to the room who soon had the problem fixed. Breakfast was excellant with the usual fruits, cereals, juices laid out buffet style. Cooked breakfast was ordered at the table, with a good selection and served fresh cooked. The only thing that we felt let down on was the evening meal in the restaurant. There wasnt a great variety of choice and the portions we got were the smallest we have ever seen and not particularly cheap when you compared some of the offers at nearby restaurants.

Rocco keeps the place ultra clean and tidy and the students were no problem at all ... they arrived  back from their evening out late but went straight to bed.. plane noise stops around midnight and wouldnt normally be a problem but the heat wave meant having to leave the window open (fly screens and shutters available.)Good base for inexpensive arrival and departures as its literally across the road from airport,and would be a good place to base a backpacking stop as trains and buses stop 5 minutes away to main Tuscan towns and cities and coast.

Walk to Fashion Valley shopping center, San Diego's premiere shopping spot, or take the trolley and tour the city, or just &quot;jell out&quot; and enjoy the ambiance of this mid-city oasis. This resort is meant to be experienced, appreciated and savored. It is an established property with the charm of a more gracious era, which I value,  and, while not new, it is well-maintained. My daughter and I stayed in a lovely bungalow room near the front pool and Trelisses restaurant and the bathroom vent fan was inoperable. We called maintenance and it was replaced within an hour.  The comment card that I filled out upon departure was acknowledged by Barbara Whitlock, who thanked me personally for my input. That kind of service is indicative of a caring staff and management. The Trelisses' manager, Robin Davis, was always on site, greeting guests and personally seeing that her guests were treated royally by her amazing staff, who served up joy along with the tasty selections. So, if you go and have an issue, know that, if you report it, it will be dealt with immediately. Things will always happen, but it is how it is dealt with that is important.

Breakfast was free every day, it was simple but just what I liked- fresh fruit (yum pineapple), bagels, yogurts, etc.   If I had one complaint it would be that you had to pay for parking, but splitting the cost between 2 people made it not so bad.

641884110,"We had out-of-town relatives coming for Christmas (in Calgary) so we booked a night here as a way for all of us (5 of us) to be together and do something fun. You could tell from early in the booking process (November) that it is their first season with the Nordic Spa so I give them lots of rope as they try and navigate this very successful attraction.  We booked over a month in advance and it was very hard to figure out how it all worked and had to call back numerous times in November to finally get a room package and be put on a massage booking waiting list.  We arrived around noon on December 23 and the front desk had a long line up.  I'm a Gold elite Marriott member and knowing the Pomeroy is a Marriott hotel, I casually asked if there was an Elite check-in line like in most Marriott's. The gentleman I asked said no, but would be happy to check me in himself.  He turned out to the be Front Office Manager and his service went beyond any expectations I could have imagined.  Every question I had, Liam took care to answer and to find solutions for us.  He even escorted me over to the Nordic Spa so we could try and find answers to my questions.  Thanks to his special care, our stay went well.  I enjoyed the Nordic Spa and I have to commend the Spa system for managing the crowds.  When we were in the Spa, it felt calm, relaxed and never overcrowded.  Two of us had massages and I loved mine with Brian. He was experienced and top notch as well, plus the equipment in the room was very good.  The hotel also did an excellent job of holiday programing.  My sons are young adults, but we still found it fun to have S'mores around the outside fire at night, check out the live reindeer, and sit in the lounge listening to the evening entertainment. Our rooms were nicely renovated as well. The hotel is still struggling to getting their heat and AC system up to 2018, but we were very comfortable.The Food.We enjoyed our meal in the Bar/Lounge area but found the dinner buffet called Forte and the take out food in The Market Cafe &quot;hit and miss&quot;.  Some of it was tasty and some was truly awful.  Our take away salad at the Market Cafe had Kale and Broccoli that had &quot;gone off&quot;.  But on the good side, when we shared this with the staff, they were accommodating and compensated us for the less than quality food.  However, they should note their food quality as a definite area for improvement. We look forward to going again next year when I hope they have worked out the few kinks in the system.  Overall, we had a good time and give a special Shout Out to Liam, the front office manager, who is one of the best hotel employees I have ever encountered.",1,0.5235181704260654

We flew into Pisa and the Linea Rossa (L/R) bus from the airport went past the road the hotel was on, so the trip to the hotel took less than 10 minutes, very impressive! We arrived around 10am and they let us check in, which we appreciated very much. We had booked the junior suite, which was spacious and really nice. The bathroom was also good. There was free wired internet in the room. There was some traffic noise and we could hear the occasional plane, but we both slept very well. We didn't hear anything from any other room, so we found the hotel very peaceful and quiet. The breakfast was nice enough, but could have done with a few more choices in terms of bread and cereals available. We found that everywhere in central Pisa was within walking distance from the hotel. We even walked to and from the Leaning Tower on the second day (we went by bus on the first), even though it looked quite far on the map. The bus tickets are â¬1.50 single on the bus or â¬1.10 single from a tobacconist. There is plenty to see in the area around the hotel and there are several seemingly very popular restaurants on the road towards the fortress. We spent most of our time just walking and found that the city was extremely pleasant to walk around, day or night.We really enjoyed Pisa (the sights, food and markets) and the hotel and hope to go back to both at some point in the future.",1,0.4249567099567098

Night One the Front Desk offered to &quot;reset&quot; something on their end, Night Two they transferred me to Tech Support.We had a 1 BR Suite that was sold as King Bed and Sofabed.  We opened the sofa bed at bedtime...and it had no sheets.  We called the Front Desk and were told &quot;Oh they are in the closet, you just need to make the bed&quot;.  (Really?!)  OK, we'll make our own sofa bed.  (But in the process we found a mattress with stuffing coming out of the entire backside.  Eeew.  Toilet backed up at 11 p.m. and an engineer was sent promptly to fix it but that took 30 minutes - so we all waited (on the sofa bed we had just made) for him to finish his work. .  Next morning we discovered the hair dryer did not put out hot air so that necessitated a trip to Target so that on the next 2 mornings we would be able to dry our hair.The bathroom had a few of plastic cups when we arrived but once we used them on Day One, they were not replaced nor was the empty Kleenex dispenser.  So one plastic cup shared by 3 people the next night!Seems like this is way to much margin for error for one hotel to have on one visit.

We booked all accommodations indicating that we were celebrating our 38th Wedding Anniversary.Upon our arrival at the Priori we felt as if we were not expected. Although we were the only ones in the lobby, there appeared to be some confusion on how long we were staying.  We received our parking instructions and as my husband was driving off, I had to rush out to stop him so he could be re-routed to another parking lot.  The young petite women at the counter offered to help with our bags, however, they were so heavy we felt bad and declined. We booked the Williams Suite which truly was wonderful.  We couldn't have asked for nicer accommodations to spend our actual anniversary on.

The variety of food is good, ambience is informal and pleasant, and they put themselves out to help you have a fun night. A few very Italian touches, which were much appreciated, say the good buffalo mozzarella and the unusual vino novello at a very reasonable price. I recommend it and it seems that many share my opinion, if we judge by the crowd of diners and dinner parties. The only down side was my G&amp;T, which was tired to say the least (I suppose, due to the quality of the gin and the 5 ice cubes therein). The pasta con le vongole was an enjoyable surprise, and the calamari were very good. We have already booked our return visit and plan to put this establishment firmly on our local fave restarant list.",1,0.5172979797979798

642721853,"Since the motel is generally nice and well-located, it is a shame that they are so poorly managed! When I checked in with reservation through Southwest Airlines, they told me I had no reservation despite the e-mail confirmation and credit card charge (in full for five days) I showed them. Rather than give us a room, and clear it up after, they told me I had to phone Southwest. After haggling with the desk clerk and the manager (over the phone) I phoned Southwest, who immediately located my reservation and told the motel to give us a room. They then put us in a room on the side of the motel facing a large construction site. Awakened the next morning by loud machinery, I asked to be moved. They told me they had one room available if we moved right away. We packed up, went to the desk, only to find out that the room actually wasn't available for the full remainder of our stay! Add to this that our room was never cleaned during the entire 5-day stay--despite two separate requests to do so, we were not given a required parking pass on check-in and the key failed two separate times.

Lot of space in bathroom and generous in closets. No bottled drinking water only soft drinks in mini bar. Breakfest rather poor for four stars. Fortunately one can order coffee from restaurant kitchen since coffee machine produced rather dismal coffee. Service is noticed only at the front door. No information about trip opportunities or events in the town. However access to the pool and other amenities in the hotel was appreciated.

Making the reservation was easily done by phone, and our contact chose a room for us once she heard this was a special occasion. Indeed the room was lovely, spotless, and charming, with great views of the river and the city, although we wished there had been more than one drawer as we unpacked. But, it had an electric fireplace so we were happy - what charm! We were on a concierge floor, and couldn't have asked for more, with a rather extensive continental breakfast each day, a fully stocked bar and snacks each afternoon, as well as attractive and comfortable surroundings with great city and river views. The concierge staff was consistently friendly, professional and knowledgeable, with an impressive knack for remembering guests' names. Our housekeeper did a great job and as we were leaving to return home she declared that she liked us! We had our anniversary dinner at the hotel's Champlain restaurant, a perfect venue for a special occasion. The meal was perfect, and our waiter, Francois, couldn't have been better.

One day is plenty of time to see the buildings.  FYI, The airport in Pisa is very small and cabs are relatively accessible.

There are also a lot of parking lots nearby, and the hotel offers parking for $13/day.The rooms are nicely decorated, with a modern urban-loft feel (I loved the brick and stone walls!). Maybe because of the walls the noise was really well controlled and little or nothing could be heard from the other rooms. We stayed in a regular room so I cannot speak of the suites (which I am sure are amazing), but our room was of a decent size (maybe a tad small if you are used to US standards). There were a couple of full mirrors (great to check if I had packed and picked the right clothes) and other standard amenities. I loved to find a recycling bin and a little box with q-tips and cotton discs.The breakfast was small but included a variety of things: pastries, cereal, fruit, pate, cheese, eggs, sausage... and great coffee! Breakfast was served at Toast!, the hotel restaurant, and it felt super cozy and casual.Although my favorite part of the hotel, without a doubt, was the staff.

Did not have one of those annoying window/wall ac things. I did notice that the bathroom did not have a fan in it. Wished that it did. And, they wanted10$ for wifi in the room. Only free wifi inthe lobby. Thought bout going to the lobby in my pjs just to make a point that they should have free wifi. Mcdonalds does plus most of the other hotels on hotel circle.

The check in staff were quick and friendly.  The breakfast buffet was fresh and well kept.  The wait staff were attentive and friendly.  All of our rooms on the 8th and 10th floors were very nice with great linen, and comfortable beds and adjustable AC.  We were on the side of the hotel that faces Target and we had no problem with noise at all.**One important note, Management shoud consider securing the window in room 1011 before someone falls out of the window.  It opens all the way up with no screen .  **   Planning a reception was easy once I was able to deal with Silver M.  Once Silver received the OK to book our reception, she was attentive, and was quick at returning phone calls and answering emails.  We planned this reception from Arizona and through emails and photos, it was exactly as was promised.  Many compliments on the food and the look of the room.  The dinner staff was attentive and professional . Ceaser was a pleasure to work with when talking about the setup of the room.Many thanks for an event that was exactly to our asking.

The good things* Close to train station.* Clean and quiet (where we were).* Front desk was extremely helpful with train schedules, and even suggestions on which days to go (some towns 'shut down' on Sunday).* it seemed very quick to the Tower for us, because the path was along a major shopping street, and we love to shop. We came in the back side of the Tower (I think) and avoided the bulk of vendors selling wares in the Field of Miracles area. * The hotel was close to a great pizza place and tons of 'cheap' shopping places (i.e., questionable if those 'Made in Italy' tags can be believed)....if you like that sort of thing! * Breakfast was overall good - fresh coffee/espresso; juices, ham, salami, cheeses, fresh hard rolls, etc. Only complaint was canned fruit - but it was better than no fruit at all.* Mini bar had good beverages at a reasonable price, and good wine was available at the front desk.* Taxi is about 11 euro to the airport.The not-so-good* In the heat of July, the a/c was not really effective, and the hotel management would turn it off while we were gone (we left it on) so we always came back to a very warm room. The device was set into the entry area, and so a wall blocked the air from fully circulating. Also, the thermostat only let us set the a/c to a certain point. I'll admit to being spoiled by my a/c at home, but I needed it a couple more degrees cool to sleep really well. Besides, if it had ever reached the set temp, it would have cycled off (I am assuming - I've seen similar machines in Italy and they cycle on and off).* Our last night, the a/c seemed to quit altogether. Nothing but warm air blowing in the morning.Overall, I'd say average to very good.",1,0.5239995822890559

There were maintenance problems in the room also including, among other things, a toilet cistern that dripped all night and a radiator control knob that fell off when we tried to adjust the heat.

If you are looking for a great hotel with ambience, good  food, lovely surroundings and a relaxed bedroom then STAY AWAY.This hotel is a 2 star â itâs not had a refurb since 1970 â everything is rusting and there is NO green grass/a palm tree anywhere â only concrete (even by the pool). This is a small list of issues:1. Bedroom â basic, basic, basic â no luxury whatsoever.  A bed, TV, chair and a curtain. Thatâs it. Think Travelodge â find for one night but not longer. And a great view of a crumbling concrete building opposite (which should have been knocked down 20 years ago)2. Pool â good size âhowever, surrounded by  concrete and no trees, grass, shade3. Beach â only has chairs, no sun loungers. You need to pay an additional 8 euros per person PER DAY to have a sun lounger on the beach4. Food â breakfast â dreadful â terrible coffee (hard to do in Italy!), no fresh orange juice, no fresh fruit, no pastries, no choice5. Dinner â basic buffet of salad and choice of 5 main courses all covered with the same tasting sauce6. Entertainment â none â not even some background music after dinner outside for three of the evenings â totally dull, nothing to do, no atmosphere at all 7. No wifi - except for a charge8. Area â awful â like an old British seaside resort desperately needing to be rejuvenated. You fill find lots of concrete parks, concrete paths and thatâs itFor the Â£900 we each paid, it was terrible value for money â even Â£350 per person would be a lot.Stay away unless you are using it as a base only â however, given the location itâs not a great place.I have never written a review, but I didnât want anyone else to have the same experience as we did â we are not snobby, just normal English people who wanted to have a nice holiday in a nice hotel as a treat.",-1,0.5072997416020673

Second time we had a pizza and it was awful - sauce appeared to be tomato sauce from a can and way to much of it, pizza was burned, and meat (hamburger) was not identifiable as such - squares of tough substance.

We had booked the hotel again the night before we derarted from Italy having had a fantastic 10 days. We decided to eat in the hotel with a good looking menu in English at the reception. That was our first error. When asking what wine they had by the glass it was either a red or a white!!!!! In a 5* hotel!! When we were brought the menu it was only available in Itallian an was completely different from the one at rception!!! Nothing that caught our fancy but we had made our decision to eat here by then. After about the time expected to cook a Risotto and pasta the food arrived along with the bread. There were no side plates for the bread and no butter and it was a little like cardboard. The food was at best POOR and not as good as you would cook at home. To cap it all you could not put the food to the room. You had to pay for it there and then!! A first. When I went to complain they did appologise after confirming that the menu at reception would be the same as at the resteraunt and they then admitted that it wasn't.  Is I left the reception I advised a person looking at the menu that this was not actually what they were serving. He had just eaten and was checking. He was a German Chef and said that it was appauling that the food he ate was so por and only one wine by the glass!!In summary, a good hotel to get your head down. DO NOT EAT HERE. It will put you off Itallian food forever.",-1,0.417798353909465

The hotel is in a very convenient location in lower town and had plenty of great restaurants within a 5 minute walk. The staff at this hotel was truly exceptional, probably some of the best service I have ever received from a hotel. All of the staff were amazing, but I especially want to point out Matthew for going above and beyond and helping us with whatever we needed and making sure that we were having a great time. He really is one of a kind and every property should have staff that care the way they do at this hotel. If we ever return to Quebec City we will definitely be staying here again.",1,0.6242063492063492
143923176,"My girlfriend and I stayed here about a month ago and we had such a wonderful time in NOLA! This being my third time to the Big Easy, I really wanted to stay somewhere near Lafitte's Blacksmith Shop (my favorite bar by far). This was the perfect location!It's perfectly situated far enough from crazy Bourbon St. and we didn't have too much noise inteference, except for the Bachelorette party that came stumbling in one of the nights. Who could blame them? Other than that though, it was the perfect distance from the huge party scene, but perfectly walkable to it within 5 minutes if needed.The only thing I feel I have to mention (not necessarily a bad thing) was the mysterious wake up occurence I experienced every night we were there. I usually sleep very well in hotels, but for some reason, I'd wake up around the same time every night. We also experienced tapping on our walls one of the nights and the distinct smell of freshly lit matches in the bathroom during one of the mornings. When we'd come back to the room, a few of the items on our side tables would be shuffled around a little well after the housekeeping hours had occured.Other than these oddities, the only other thing I can mention is that the rooms are very small and quaint. For us, we didn't need too much room because we were rarely in the room anyways. It was just the right amount of space for us to come back to in order to recompose.4 stars Andrew Jackson!",0,0.5892490842490842

Reception helpful at check-in and when I rang re car parking. Room was comfortable, well equipped and clean. I was hooked with the ipod dock meaning I didn't need to set up my own speakers. Microwave, hob and toaster went unused, kettle and enough for four cuppas was used. Bed was comfortable. Shower and toilet good (usual gripe in UK - no toilet brush). Exactly what it says on the tin.The location is central and great, with a pub 25 yards away and a chippy 50 yards away. Right next to China town and only 600 yards approx. to the Midland Hotel where my meeting was.Any drawbacks? - I was going to stay in Premier Inn but it was full. This cost me Â£3 more so I suppose It could be compared directly. On the plus side spec is far superior an the minus side sometimes you may wish to frequent the hotel bar or wish for a full English Breakfast - both of which I was happy to forego.I will likely use Roomzzz again.",1,0.5678571428571431

They accommodated our food allergies and sensitivities without question and have a system to ensure that all of the servers are aware.  The spa services were wonderful and the ambiance is so relaxing.  The only constructive feedback is the adherence of the guests to refrain from using their phones/technology in common areas.

If you're looking for a location that's less expensive then downtown but still close to major attractions, this is it.  The service at this hotel is what makes it a 4* compared to a 3*.We had a delayed flight as well as a long car rental experience and therefore checked in after midnight.  The night desk clerk was wonderful and accomodating.  The room itself faced the freeway (hotel is RIGHT off the I-8 freeway) but the noise wasn't a problem for us at all.  With the fan on in the room, you couldn't hear the quiet buzz of traffic at all.  The room was clean and modern.  Bathroom was very small, but had new tiles and was spotless.  No fridge in the room but that wasn't a problem for us. There is a restaurant / bar at this hotel that was surprisingly good.  The waitress was super friendly.  We had the fritatta and huevos rancheros, and both were really, really good.  Later in our stay we stopped by this same lounge for a drink and had a very entertaining bartender.

We read that your bed type is not guaranteed with HotWire -- I envisioned having to spend our anniversary trip in separate beds!  So we were very relieved at checkin. Clemente could not have been more accommodating!  I suspect there are only certain rooms that they can give you if you book on HotWire, since I presume the rate is quite a bit lower, but he looked for quite awhile and found us a beautiful room that we were very happy with!  It even had a fridge, which helped us a lot (we love to bring home our restaurant leftovers!)  We are in the habit of walking in the mornings, and we could not have asked for more breathtakingly beautiful surrounds for our morning walk!  The property is huge!  It seemed on the day we checked in that most people were there attending a conference of some kind, whereas on the weekend we saw more families enjoying the pools together. They have three eating experiences right on the grounds - a deli-type where you can buy sandwiches, etc., a sports-bar called Charlie's, and a more upscale restaurant.

The atmosphere was hip and easy, as if the Farmer's Daughter left the Farm but took certain elements of it with her when she boarded the bus to LA.

The bed was King Size....enough room for two (or 4) with a separate  washing area and bathroom......yes, closed off with a big barn door painted black.  What I loved about it was the decorator really honed in on tying together the old with the new, the rustic with the hip, and lastly an overall feeling of warmth.  I would def stay again.

We stayed in the main lodge which made access to restaurants, marketplace cafÃ©, pool, hot tub, gym and everything else very easy.  Hotel has three floors so you are not far from anything.  We had a suite with jacuzzi which was very nice.  It had an adjoining standard room that we booked for the kids so everyone could have lots of space.  Our bedroom was separate so the middle area between the two rooms became our living room.  Worked out really well.Forte staff Sam, Justine, Anouk are very friendly and made sure we had great atmosphere for our meals.  Woody's Bar Mary and Jonathan kept things humming when we dropped in for a evening bite and drinks. Staff are young and enthusiastic throughout the hotel and restaurants.

The location of this hotel for a quiet get away is fantastic.  There are mountains everywhere and you are not stuck in the middle of a tourist trap.  We have been through Canmore and Banff and getting back to the quiet of the hotel at the end of the day is a blessing.

Restaurant prices are comparable to eating in restaurants in either of the towns.

Surrounding the hotel are lots of trails for biking, horseback riding, running and great views for walking.  there is Tennis, basketball, baseball, bike rentals, outdoor shop onsite etc..Today we went to Barrier lake and rented kayaks - a little windy but great little side trip.

There is a quintessential attention to detail at the Pierre I don't think I have every really experienced in the States except maybe at the Four Seasons in Boston.Be prepared for a wonderful, wonderful eggs Benedict every morning  if you want (one of the choices) in their sunny cheerful breakfast room. One of the waiters is such a happy guy he tends to sing in French which is truly charming. They will make you an espresso or latte if you want and there are newspapers to spread out and read at your leisure. Don't hesitate to try the peach flavored with maple syrup jam that comes on your table. It's divine!The front desk staff is attentive and helpful. They even helped me deal with turning off my phone's cellular data (hint: don't forget to deal with the roaming charge issue before you leave the states that you will have when you change countries-that can get expensive!). They have free wi-fi which was fast and convenient. The concierge made reservations for us at Chez Boulay which is a farm to table restaurant that we just loved and that gets great reviews. For two restaurants that you can walk to in two minutes from the hotel that are charming, choose Cafe San Malo which we went to for dinner one night and  Restaurant Le Brigantin where we had a really memorable Caesar salad (with perfect croutons and delicious lardons) and a local cheese plate for lunch on their outside patio.The room was spotless and comfortable.

There were lots of activities to do in and around the hotel. There were hills to go tobogganing on, ice skating, shopping, spa services, relaxing in the indoor/outdoor hot tub, and going for dinner/drinks at one of the many restaurants. We really enjoyed the outdoor hot tub. It was a little cooler than the inside part of the hot tub but still a great experience. We ate at two restaurants and also had in-room dining. All of the food/drinks were really good. The brunch buffet on Sunday morning was fantastic! The variety of food and the quality of food was excellent. I really enjoyed having a creme brulee to finish off my nice meal. There are different rooms (older/newer) at the Delta in Kananaskis. We stayed in one of the older rooms and the decor was dated but it was clean and still a nice stay. Some of our friends stayed in rooms that had recently been redone and they were very happy with their room and the body lotions that were included with the room.

In addition to Fairmont quality - attentive service (1 exception see below), elegance and impeccable rooms and common areas, there are wonderful views from most rooms - we looked out over the St. Lawrence and Champlain monument - a location that makes it easy to walk the old city, and a hotel itself rich in art and history. Location was especially important as a good part of our trip was visiting museums, churches and monuments related to my wife's Quebecois ancestry. Helpful suggestions and directions were always at hand, day trips and tickets to local attractions arranged as if by magic, and (with one suggestion, see below) first rate food and beverage service.  That said, I highly recommend trying some of the local restaurants, bistros etc, not just to save money, but to try local specialties while rubbing elbows with the locals who indeed embody joix d'vivre.  The one dark cloud:  Twice in the 1608 bar we experienced abysmally slow service - totally out of tune with the rest of the hotel - plus 2 botched cocktails.

The bathrooms are clean too!. Loved how quiet our floor was. We got a room in the back of the hotel away from events and I am glad we did. You dont even hear anyone next door. Loved it!We didnt get to try the breakfast as I couldn't justify the cost per person but I heard it is really good. The only thing is if you are staying on a weekend it is hard to find parking close to your room if their is an event going in. The front desk was nice enough to let us park in a valet spot so that worked out . Will make this our regular place when we visit the area.,1,0.6233468286099865

I had two double beds, a table, two sofa chairs, tv, hair dryer, ironing board and iron. We also had a mini fridge which was great to keep our bottles cold and ready for the next soccer game. I found the room and especially the bathroom very clean. The beds were extra comfy and I loved the fluffy pillows and fluffy blankets. I had a very good night sleep which doesn't usually happen often at hotels. They also have party rooms which the team rented for couple hours on a Saturday night so we could have a dinner together and socialize after our first day of soccer games. The room was big enough for 30 people. We ordered pizza from Zaza for our party. The pizza is the best in Brantford. They are located at 155 Lynden Road, phone number is 519-751-2777. Cooked on a wood fired oven. Everyone enjoyed the pizza and the hotel was kind enough to allow us to store the two left over pizzas in their fridge in the hotel resteraunt called Kirby's. What I also liked about the hotel is that it is right off of the 403 so you are not driving through town to find it. It has lots of stores and resteraunts near by: Food Basics, Zehrs, McDonalds, Timmy's, Winners, Home Depot, Canadian Tire, etc. Very close to lots of ammenities. For travel soccer teams, it is 8 minutes away from John Wrights soccer fields. They have a play area for kids near the courtyard. Our players played soccer in the middle of the courtyard as there is a nice large grassed in area. They also used the pool for a quick refreshing dip and my son liked the size of it. Continental breakfast is included with the room but if you want you can pay $5.60 and add a hot breakfast which was scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, omelettes, waffles, pancakes. One morning we did grap the hot breakfast. I found the pancakes small and some hard and the waffles were also small. They could improve on the breakfast. I had scrambled eggs and they didn't exactly taste homemade. Other than that, this is a faboulous hotel. Check out was fast and I did ask for later check out of 11:30 am and they did allow that which I thought was very nice of them. I went to the Kirby resteraunt to grab my pizzas at checkout and was waiting to talk to a waitress to ask her to get them for me. As I was standing there, one of the customer service personnel from the front desk handed me the pizzas. She saw me waiting and went to get them herself as she figured I would have to wait a long time as the resteraunt staff was very busy. I appreciated that the staff tried to anticipate your needs.

But the only thing that grossed me out was the mini bar has something empty in it. I wonder what else they didn't clean if they didn't clean out the fridge? Anyways, it would good enough for our 3 night stay and we enjoyed lots of time at the beach. It's not as close to the beach as it seems, it's probably a good 8 minute walk.

On Sunday night we watched the &quot;Fire and Ice&quot; show at the base of the gondola from our window.   The room was large, well laid out and handled our family in comfort.  There was a nice kitchen area and we cooked dinner in the room almost every night.  The roof top hot tub was in good condition and I thought it was nicer in person than in the virtual tour.   We used the hot tub everyday after skiing. We travel to Whistler yearly and have stayed in many different hotels.  This was our first stay with Sundial and it will now be our #1 choice.

Very spacious with everything you need EXCEPT a plug near a mirror, made it extremely difficult to try and get ready using hair straighteners. The room was very clean and the iMac and tv at the bottom of the bath were fantastic!The main thing that let this place down was the noise, we stayed on the top floor and heard people shouting etc from the street as well as near by pub music and traffic, emergency vehicles etc. I am a light sleeper so this doesn't help much but the bed was fantastic, really big and comfy so no complaints there!We didn't make it down for breakfast so can't comment on that but what we did see for sale in the pantry was reasonably priced.I really would recommend this hotel and I would stay here again even with the noise!",1,0.4985555555555555

As I said above, I had dinner (both nights I stayed) in the hotel's restaurant - perfect service, good food and a superb glass of wine accompanying it.

The hotel provides outstanding service and is much quieter than the other well known hotel in town which draws too many tourists. Everyone from the porter, to the front desk staff, the restaurant and bar staff, and housekeeping are helpful and friendly. If there is anything that you need, they are there to assist. When our bags were brought to our room, the bellman explained our room from where to find things to how to operate the lights and heat. Our room had a king bed and a small couch tucked in a little alcove, two closets, and an iron and ironing board. The bathroom was quite large with a soaking tub, a separate open rain shower, and a heated floor. As a repeat guest, there was a nice note welcoming us back and a box of chocolate cake-like cookies in the shape of the maple leaf. There is a bar area with free coffee and tea, and there is a minibar at a cost. Each night there was turndown service and special tea bags were left on the nightstand along with bottled water. As we were there over Christmas, the owners left a nice note along with a plate of tangerines and a box of chocolates wishing us Happy Holidays. On Christmas Eve Santa arrived in the lobby to greet children, and complimentary mulled wine, hot chocolate, and cookies were provided. We enjoyed lunch one day at Bar Artefect and dinner one evening at Chez Muffy. Both wonderful choices. We took a drive one day and the porter gave us bottled water for our journey.

We were given a room on the 9th floor.  The elevator was so rickety, I asked for a lower floor room.  The front desk gal was clearly annoyed even though I had just come from a very empty lobby.  She put me on hold so long I hung up and called back.  At which point she said that a bellman was already on the way with new keys.  She couldn't have gotten back on the phone and explained that to me?We were then put in Room 1129, the carpet was so damp that it smelled like mildew, but at this point it was after midnight.The line to get a table for the buffet took literally 20 minutes Friday morning.

Instead we sat inside with little birds flying around.We came back friday night late and discovered the phone didn't work, so we went to the front desk to tell them we were checking out Saturday morning.  We also inquired about room service.  The front desk did not have a menu, but gave me a number to call from the lobby phone.

Itâs a small hotel just over a quarter a mile from the station and less than a mile from the Tower.The room was relatively large but could have done with a lick of paint in a couple of places  Having arrived in the afternoon and spent the later part of the day sightseeing it was lovely to be able to sit outside and have fun with the rest of my family when we came back from dinner.

3657168,"I booked the hotel on the strength of its reviews here on tripadvisor.com and it being the best rated hotel in Pisa.I wasn't disappointed, it was a nice hotel and a good base to explore.LOCATIONOn a quiet backstreet south of the river - quiet meaning not very busy - remember Italy being Italy there are scooters screaming about at all hours!  The double glazing was good though.  The hotel is probably the best located in Pisa - a 30 second walk from the banks of the Arno, a 90 second walk from the Corso Italia - the main shopping street, and not much further to Pisa Centrale rail station (from where it's an easy one hour trip to Firenze).  Going in the opposite direction, cross the river and you're into Piazza Garibaldi and then the Borgo Stretto - full of pavement cafes and bars.  Only a little further and you're up to the Leaning Tower and the Field of Miracles.  It's extremely memorable to walk round a corner and see the (arguably) most famous building in the world appear before you.FOODBreakfast was served 7am - 10am in the lovely ground floor breakfast room.  It consisted of a selection of cereals, fruit, cheese, meat, juices, bread and pastries.  There was plenty of room, no queues and the staff came and asked if you wanted coffee or tea.  Must have been a quieter time than one of the previous reviwer's visit.STAFFreception staff were excellent, as were waiting and housekeeping.  The hotel has a transfer service, charging â¬12 per party to the airport or Tower.ROOMSThe rooms were of a good size and had an impressive vaulted ceiling.  The bathroom was lovely, with a good selection of free toiletries and towels changed daily.  A few gripes - when I booked the listing said all rooms had a hairdrier and safety deposit box - they had NEITHER.  Moreover, satellite TV was also promised and there was none in my room - just 7 Italian channels.  Some rooms however did get a selection of satellite channels including CNN and BBC World, so it must have been my TV.  I reported the fault but it wasn't fixed during my stay.GARDENLovely terrace behind the hotel, with wicker chairs and parasols.RECOMMENDATIONSThe reception recommended a pizzeria just down a nearby alley.  It was OK, but we had better meals elsewhere.  In particular, one on Via Santa Maria opposite the Leaning Tower in the heart of the tourist zone.  Amazingly, prices were quite uniform all over town, whether you're in the real Italy or the tourist area.  PISAHaving never been before, I was impressed with Pisa overall.  There's not a great deal there after the famous monuments in the Field of Miracles, but interesting little corners.  It's more of a real Italian town away from the tourist areas, though as I mentioned above the prices are the same (high!) pretty much all over town.Staying there gives you the chance to explore the famous sites in your own time, and also visit the Leaning Tower at night when many of the crowds have gone away on their bus tours.",1,0.4962579266611524

We each did something different including the milk and sesame stone wrap, moor mud hydro wrap, seaweed body masque, deep tissue massage and the botanical body masque. If you want to save yourself some money go to Costco and pick up the Way Spa gift cards. You can purchase a $100 gift card for $80 so if when your bill adds up to $400 or so (which happens very quickly!) you can use the cards and save a little money. Amongst us we saved over $200 using the cards. You can apply them against your whole stay not just the spa services. There's lots to keep you busy other than the spa. We enjoyed using the eucalyptus steam room, hot tub and cold plunge. My only criticism might be that the hot tub and plunge are small. It got pretty crowded in the hot tub at some points. There are lots of classes to choose from. We did the gentle stretch which was very nice. The grounds are extensive and it would be beautiful to go for a walk there we just ran out of time.

117618272,"After reading the reviews about this b&amp;b I did not hesitate to book it for two separate stays either side of a visit elsewhere in Tuscany. I was collected at the airport by Claudia's son late at night and brought back swiftly to the b&amp;b, where Claudia presented me with a light supper. Quite unexpected! I was made to feel so very welcome and part of the family. Claudia was most helpful with suggestions for activities, maps and restaurants nearby. Upon my second stay I became ill and Claudia took me to seek medical attention. She assisted me so kindly in a situation that every traveller away from home dreads. I will never forget her. This b&amp;b was truly a 'home away from home'.",1,0.5700000000000001
142536800,"We recently stayed at the Handlery for 3 nights. The rooms were small, with 2 double beds close together, being a family travelling with 2 boys aged 13 &amp; 10 there wasn't much space when we were all in there together. However the beds were comfortable &amp; the rooms were really quiet during the night. Bathroom was small &amp; the air conditioning didn't cool the room too well due to the high pitched roof. Our fridge wasn't cooling our drinks, so they sent the maintenance guy to replace it, but the replacement one wasn't much better, so we had to put a bucket of ice in the fridge to keep drinks cold. The pool area is nice, but the day we arrived it was busy and no deck chairs were available, pool towels were really thin quality.Breakfast was ok, quite basic, but they offered cereal, toast, fruit &amp; pastries, so we it was plenty for us.The hotel is located beside the freeway, so it's easy to get to places if you have a car, but if you don't there's not many restaurants close by. There's a large shopping centre about 5-10mins walk, it's has plenty of shops &amp; an eatery.The staff were very friendly and always willing to help, especially Jimmy the maintenance guy, he was very friendly &amp; was really helpful when we had a few issues with our room.I would recommend this hotel for a short stays as its clean &amp; comfortable, but if you are staying longer than a few days, like spacious rooms &amp; don't have a car then I would stay elsewhere.",1,0.5011011904761905

166068611,"I stayed at Roomzz for 3 nights for a conference at the University. The aparthotel was by far the best value I could find in the city centre, and I was very pleased with the generous size of the room - which is more than double the size of most budget stays. Roomzzz is in a gorgeous period building, which make a change from many soulless hotels - however it is a little basic. I say this because the atmosphere in the rooms themselves are just quite clinical and bare. All the lights in my room (of which there were MANY) had nasty white fluorescent bulbs, which meant that making it cosy at night was impossible. Also, being on the first floor meant that I had to keep the blinds down, or nearly down, so that people walking past at window level couldn't see in! Of course these things aren't deal-breakers, but it takes the edge off what could be a very stylish place. My other comment would be that this is probably best if you are coming to Manchester for leisure/going out, as it was very noisy at night, particularly on Friday/Saturday, when people were chatting in the corridor at 4am, and there was loud music playing at a nearby bar.",1,0.4877777777777779

133882877,"We stayed at this hotel for a week and we were to have a superior room with breakfast, however the room was on the small side and I did go back down to the reception to ask if we were in a superior room thinking we maybe had been given the wrong room.  I was told all the rooms were superior and that above this they had suites.  We had a room that overlooked the pool but it didn't have a balcony and given we were staying for the week it would have been nice to have had a balcony.  The hotel is very modern and has  a lovely pool, although the rattan sun loungers were very uncomfortable and could do with cushions.   The breakfast buffet was good although the restaurant at night was very slow in their service and the tables were near the pool and after dusk the mosys came out in force.   It is a 15min walk to the leaning tower from the hotel and you can catch a bus right outside the hotel which costs 1euro 50 and it takes you to the train station.   Last bus into town is at 8.20 and a taxi home costs around 10 euros.  The hotel was ok for a short break but I would not want to stay there for a week again. Pisa is excellent for train links to Florence and Lucca at the station they have ticket machines which are in English so it is easy to understand and buy tickets.  Florence is 40mins away and Lucca 20mins and trains are a lot cheaper than the UK around 14 euros return to Florence and 7 euros return to Lucca which are both well worth a visit.",0,0.5181084656084657
610939264,"Hilton Whistler staff exceeded our expectations during this hotel stay. Our family travels a lot and have a good idea about service standards in the hospitality industry. During our stay we were so pleased with level of service and consistency of service we received from staff. Prior to check-in we wanted to merge our 2 separate bookings together so that we wouldn't have to change rooms. Staff informed us that there wasn't a similar room available on one of the nights, so they offered to upgrade us to a higher rated room- such excellent service to offer this option to us. When we checked-in we were surprised that they had upgraded us to a much higher rated room. The room was very impressive!Later in our stay, another customer accessed our room with a key- it was a mistake. When we made staff aware, a Manager immediately contacted us to apologize and then came up to our room with a new set of keys and also offered us complimentary breakfast for the next morning. We were so impressed with the swift response, concern for our security, and hospitality that staff and the manager demonstrated. In our many years of travelling, this is the best example of customer service we have received. We are BC residents and visit Whistler at least 10 times a year. This was our first time staying at the Hilton Whistler and will absolutely stay there again and recommend it to our friends, family, and work colleagues. ",1,0.5335399449035814

We had Ralph as our private chef (small extra charge per person) prepare a meal in the cottage. Bring your own beverages was a bonus as well and suited our group.  The cottage was well appointed. Only criticism is lack of door for the extra twin beds on main floor to help with privacy and noise reduction for large adult groups. They handled our group well. We had every meal together which was a bonus.  Spa staff in all cases respectful, pleasant and helpful.  Loved the variety of options from quiet time to yoga to evening turn out of horses.

The staff made our honeymoon so special. We arrived and had a beautiful room with a river-front view that they set up for us. Chocolates on the bed, plush towels, down pillows, etc. Every small detail was attended to. Even in the lobby they had fresh apples to grab as you come and go. We appreciated the detail so much. Breakfast every morning was in the cutest, classiest little modern cafe downstairs. There were waiters who got to know us and figured out that I got a hot chocolate every morning ;). There were baguettes and cheeses and jams and croissants. So yummy! When we came back, we tried to replicate our &quot;French&quot; breakfast at home. It just wasn't the same! The wait staff was so wonderful.The concierge was incredibly helpful. They always helped us when we had questions on the area, and didn't treat us like &quot;tourists.&quot; They actually helped us stay away from some tourist-y things, and recommended the BEST restaurants that many tourists may not discover on their own. From calling cabs to getting our bags and offering water, again, they were so attentive to detail.We've recommended this hotel to everyone we know since! Such a great place.

The adjoining restaurant was excellent and also enjoyed the bar area where you could get small tasty snacks if you're been travelling a lot and just want to have something light for dinner.  Despite it being a hotel, it has a homey feel and the room was very comfortable.  Absolutely loved the sheets (white/texture); as in loved them.

The room was very clean, but a bit dated. I didn't like having the sink outside of the toilet/tub area. The sink area was also small so it was a bit crowded getting ready each day. The king sized bed was comfortable and had wonderfully comfy pillows. The one huge drawback was the sofa sleeper. It was awful! The mattress was very thin and had tons of bumps and bulges. I am pretty sure that the springs could be felt through the mattress. So, the people that shared the sofa bed were very, very uncomfortable. Also, there were only three sets of towels for five people. We called the front desk and immediately someone came up with extra towels. Also, the second day we came up to our room around 3:30 and it still had not been cleaned. As we were leaving at 4:00 we saw the maid coming towards our room. We were next to the highway so it was a bit noisy, but the sliding glass door did a pretty good job of cancelling some of the noise out. All in all it was a pretty good stay.

To top that off, the bed itself was the most uncomfortable I have ever been in - I would rather have slept on the floor, but didn't quite trust that.The furniture was stained, and the room was musty. When I went to the front desk to register a complaint, I was given the &quot;We don't have another room&quot; response. Stayed there 3 days, and in that time probably slept a total of 3 hours.

Sometimes, it's dangerous and unacceptable; other times (like last year, getting a room shaped like an arrowhead), it's just weird. I'm so happy to say my experience at the Courtyard Marriott on San Diego's Hotel Circle was a complete delight and offered no surprises.Check-in went smoothly, taking no more than five minutes. Our room was clean (and my companion and I are both VERY picky about such things), the towels were plentiful, and housekeeping left the room tidy and organized before our return each day. The fridge housing could have been dusted a little better, but the bathroom and bedroom were spotless.  The bed was firm, but so comfortable I had the five best night's sleep of the entire year, and the comforter was just the right weight. The air conditioning/heating control let us make the room the perfect temperature without excessive noise. This is the second time in six months I've stayed in a Courtyard, and I like the little touches like the mini-mantels with the black and white paintings, the excellent flat-screen TV with high-quality cable and spiffy, fashionable bathrooms, comfortable desk chair and numerous electronic input panels, easily accessible on the visible wall behind the desk. Two outlets at bedside, right under the bedside lights, enable charging of digital devices. This is a perfect room for the modern traveler.We loved that the free WiFi was blazingly fast; at our conference hotel (a five minute walk away), my colleagues were complaining that the paid-for Wi-Fi was unpredictable and slow, but because I'd read Trip Advisor, I knew to stay away from that venue for sleeping. If you're staying at an (ahem) conference center on Hotel Circle, stay here and walk the five minutes. The staff was friendly, and helpful, though a little unimaginative. The snack bar is right next to the bar; when the snack bar was closed at 11:05p and I wanted a juice, the young men behind the counter shrugged apologetically. I suggested they hand the juice bottle to the bartender and let her ring it up. After much discussion among themselves, they did that, but then the bartender gave me the wrong change without comment. When I pointed out the error, she noted that the bar only had quarters because of the bar's pricing methods. I had her give me back one of the quarters I gave her so that I could provide exact change. (It wasn't the money, but the principle of thinking someone wouldn't expect to get their change back.) All other experiences with the staff were exemplary. They called taxis for us which arrived (with the exception of our middle-of-the-night airport request) within five minutes. My requests for extra hangers and foam pillows were acted upon within minutes.The lobby was refreshingly modern and clean, good for hanging out and people watching, and though the computers and boarding pass kiosks were not enclosed, there wasn't much in the way of noise or distraction.",1,0.5038961038961041

We stayed in The Argentia Room and we both loved the warm and cozy feeling you get in this room.  The huge double soaker tub was amazing and we both almost fell asleep in it and the bed was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in that we wished we could have taken it home with us.....lol!!  The staff was second to none and made us feel very welcome and made us feel like we were at home!Thank you Elaine and your amazing staff and we look forward to next October when we get to stay in another one of your rooms!!!Cheers,Steven and Tanya Holden",1,0.5625000000000001

Our room was gorgeous and it was really convenient having our own kitchen etc. Everything was spotless and the staff were very helpful with looking after bags, giving directions, and helping us work out the computer. The location was excellent - you can walk anywhere you need very easily, and it's right by the free shuttle bus stop from the train station if you have heavy bags. I'd certainly recommend this place, and stay here around the country too.",1,0.7172619047619047

Anyway she said it would be a while so, we asked if the room would be ready by the time we got back from wal-mart. She said yes so we all left. When we got back she said that all 3 of my rooms were canceled. I had a total of three room rented and by then it was 11:00pm. I asked to speak to the manager and she said she was the manager.

Good breakfast on a morning which is included in the price.  Rooms were comfortable and typically european.  Free water every day in the mini fridge and plenty of toiletries in the bathroom.  No bath on our room which was room 3 overlooking the terrace and across the courtyard from the main part of the hotel.  If you book direct with the hotel then they will include your transfers to and from hotel.  We paid 5 euros each to return to the airport which the hotel arranged and took us there in their own transport.  Taxi was 15 euros however the train station is right next to the airport.  You then have a 10 minute walk from station to the hotel.  Pisa is lovely especially around the piazza where the leaning tower is.  It is magnificent.  There is a lot of graffiti around Pisa but not on the tourist sites.  Whilst in Pisa we travelled by train to Lucca, a very pretty place and 7.50 euros each return trip.  Also went on the train to Florence at 15 euros return each.  Both places very much worth it.  Lucca is about 20-30 minutes on train from Pisa and Florence is about an hour.

We stayed for 4 nights. The room was impeccably clean, the bed was extremely comfortable, and they had a nice note and treats waiting for us when we arrived. It was also very quiet and we had no inconveniences apart from normal construction noise in the city.. which really happens anywhere. All of the staff at the hotel was amazingly nice, respectful, always happy to serve and answer any questions. Last day I was not feeling well and they were happy to allow us an unusually late check out given the situation. We arranged a food tour on the first day with the concierge which is also a must when in the city. The hotel is just so glamorous, a true landmark, easily located from anywhere in the city, and is an absolute must!! We are so glad we spent a little more to stay here.

The spread wasn't bad but could do with opening up on the choice just a little more.The staff in the hotel are excellent and you could not ask for more. Everyone of them that I talked to were pleasant and made you feel welcome at all times.In the morning, the lady serving the drinks was very nice and also remembered what I liked to have which is also a bonus and the service feels all the more personal.When it comes to the rooms i can only comment on the single I had. It was very spacious and the bathroom was also a very decent size.If you're planning on discovering a little more of the surrounding area (but seriously don't just go to the famous Piazza otherwise you'll never get a feel for the real Pisa) then the train station at Pisa Santa Rossore is about 10 minutes walk away.From here, you go off to other places such as Lucca, Livorno, Genoa and Cinque Terre.If you arrive at the airport the bus drops you right outside the hotel. Price paid for this was only 1,20â¬! Do ask the hotel though before arriving which bus service it is that stops there.

The bed was amazing! Another surprise was the bathroom with twin showers! Everything in the room was brand new, carefully chosen and decorated with style!

I stayed in a Garden Room which appeared to have been recently renovated.  It had new furniture, carpet, paint, and was very clean.  The grounds were also exceptional with roses in bloom everywhere.  It is clear that this is a very old hotel that is being brought up to modern standards.  Some parts of the facility have a very old design and only a wrecking ball can fix that.  The only negative about the facility was the quality of the food.  It was overpriced for such poor quality.  I ate at the Terrace Cafe, Sunshine Deli, and had breakfast at Charlie's Trolley.  In all cases the food had no flavor at all and in some cases tasted like it had been in the freezer too long.  It was bad enough to drag my rating of the hotel down from Above Avg to Average.  In spite of this, I would recommend this hotel to any conference/business traveler.  I would not recommend it as a vacation destination though.  It caters to conferences, not individuals.

OB is a great little town, everywhere I went I was reminded of Venice Beach here in LA. Lots of friendly people, awesome co-op for groceries, and dogs are welcome almost everywhere. However, location is the only thing it has going for it...it's pretty run down and in need of some major upgrades - really overpriced for the quality of the rooms. We were woken every morning by the stomping of the upstairs guests getting ready for their day - it appears the insulation is really bad between upstairs floor and downstairs ceiling, and dogs are not allowed in upstairs rooms (I always prefer top floor because of noise issues), which of course are the rooms with the water &amp; sunset views. The bottom of the bathroom door was water damaged, the entryway light didn't work and the bathroom lights flicker on (sort of Bates Motel-ish). But like I said, this place has location and the staff is super friendly. Because of that, I will definitely return. I strongly recommend bringing slippers - the floors are tile. As a side note, if you don't care about being close to the the dog beach, I also really like the Best Western Lamplighter on El Cajon - location isn't great but the staff is awesome and the price is a little lower.

We had booked our stay for 3 days starting July 8th, however we asked if we could stay 1 more night after we were down there and they went out of their way to make it possible. The people we met and the dogs we met at the hotel were great. Also, the owner is very likeable and we spent time talking to him.

Probably the smallest room I've every stayed in.  I booked a room with 'single occupancy' on Hotels.com and the photo of this room was a very spacious double.

On the first afternoon before the dinner hour we took advantage of the outdoor pool and hot tub, and loved it. My only wish would be for a better drinks list: the lack of local craft brew and a decent wine is an oversight IMO. The Wifi also was an issue, not sure why but no biggie. The room was comfortable, roomy for the two of us, and provided us two good nights sleep. I would definitely stay here in the future and would recommend it to anyone looking for a hotel in a prime location.

Our room was the closest to Fairfax Ave and consequently all the traffic noise was clearly heard throughout the night which often can be significant.

Unfortunately, a &quot;well drink&quot; in the Trellises restaurant,DOESN'T include a Manhattan because, as he put it, &quot;we have to add sweet vermouth!&quot;Of course.

There is a magnificent Museum nearby that is a definite must to take in as well as Ferry rides across the River.  We both agree that we would go back again and you will too.",1,0.5058939393939393

591602142,"We booked this hotel for the close proximity to the airport and the shuttle service they provide.  We were not disappointed - the trip took 10 minutes and was 10 euros per room.The hotel was very modern and clean.  We were on the ground floor but it was very quiet and easy to get to the hotel facilities.The restaurant area and gardens are lovely.  However the service offered was extremely disappointing.On arrival we asked to order drinks and sat in the conservatory area.  We asked if it was ok to order drinks and then waited for the very disinterested waiter to return 20 minutes or so later to provide menus and then had a further wait to order drinks.  We took a taxi to the centre of Pisa and was surprised that it only cost 12 euros which seemed reasonable for the distance travelled.We returned to the hotel and booked a table for dinner at 9pm.  We then took a seat in the garden for pre dinner drinks.  We waited another 20 or so minutes for service and eventually had to go and find someone to ask for help.  The waitress came over and we asked for the wine list.  Again she disappeared and when we managed to see her again to ask where the list was she said &quot;there is only one in the restaurant and it is busy so you have to wait&quot;.  Not impressed.  Finally we managed to order wine, but the service was slow and the serving staff looked like they did not want to be there.We then moved to our table for dinner.  Again we waited a long time for menus and to order further drinks.  It was a very slow and disorganised service provided.  The waiting staff seemed to be running around but didn't appear to be doing much.  They were unhelpful and one in particular was extremely rude - his English was fairly good until we wanted to complain when he said he did not understand English and walked off.  The only person that seemed helpful and pleasant to diners was the guy that managed the bar and drinks.  We complained to him about the service and it did improve slightly after that.  Once the food arrived it was lovely and tasty.The hotel are letting themselves down with the service.  We would have stayed for lunch the following day or had more drinks but didn't bother due to the poor service.Would stay there again but it would be purely to sleep and would not bother having a drink or dinner at the hotel.",-1,0.5373646723646724

225299522,We were put in this hotel for the last two days of our honeymoon.on arriving my first complaint was the hotel reception smelt of stagnant water and mould.on checking in we went to find our room which was situated away from main hotel in separate building.the view from the window was of the car park not particularly romantic.we rang reception and explained we were promised a balcony over looking the pool.quickly the manager arrived with a new set of keys to a room we originally requested. Settling down to sleep we had to call reception as the air con was not working and again quickly a new set of keys was provided for a new room.slept well that night but that was my last night of sleep at this hotel. The pool showed a film on a projector every night which played loudly so we were unable to enjoy the balcony and the romantic mood of our honeymoon was killed a little. I would recommend the hotel for families with kids if they want to get involved with the entertainment it's unfortunate that we were booked into this hotel for the end of our honeymoon.Plus sides the rooms are clean and the management are helpful.,0,0.4334662413609781

Apart from the expected traffic noise during the day, it is extremely noisy at night with lots of boisterous shouting, singing and screaming that can go on till after 5 am. Much of this noise comes from drunken customers of the night club right across the road ( see the metal doors next to the Buffet King all-you-can-eat restaurant ).

AVwcgshl_7pvs4fzv3ge,"The location of this place is prime. The hotel condition, on average is nice. I found my room fantastic, with a kitchenette and living room. The elevators were old and confusing (only one went to the garage, but you could not call just that one and there were no stairs).Breakfast was average-- the scrambled eggs were really dry and so were the waffles/french toast.Some of the staff were kind and helpful, but many didn't seem to care and others seemed new. Maybe this location had a high influx of new front desk members at the time of my stay. There are two kiosks at the front desk, and a phone between. While I was checking in, the other kiosk was also occupied by a staff member assisting a customer, and another staff member was using the phone between to talk loudly to a service member about a customer who had not had their room cleaned in three days. This was concerning, distracting, and off-putting. This also distracted the lady helping me check in from doing her job.One night, we were awoken by a very loud banging noise coming from the room next to us close to midnight. The banging, accompanied by yelling, continued for several minutes. Worried and scared, I called the front desk, but the person who answered didn't seem to care about the situation and at first didn't offer a solution until I asked if there was nothing they could do, and they said they would send somebody up there again. The front desk staff member said the lady had been locked out by her partner who had deadbolted the door. By this point, the lady had been standing outside her room yelling and banging on the door for half an hour (by her account-- overheard when she yelled at her partner when he finally opened the door). I'm worried that the staff allowed this to continue for so long. What if the partner had been suffering a medical emergency, or had never opened the door Nobody followed up with us regarding this issue, which was disappointing. Had someone touched base in the morning and apologized for the inconvenience, I likely wouldn't be writing this review.Upon checkout, the front desk staff threw away a handwritten not eaddressed to me as a guest of the company whose conference I was attending because my partner was performing the checkout. Overall, I was really let down by my stay here. The rooms are so nice and the location is great. I thought the Hyatt brand could be trusted with providing a great, seamless customer experience, but it didn't seem like they cared.Hello and thank you for taking the time to share your experiences at our hotel with us. First, I offer my sincere apologies for the poor care shown to you by my team.

Sinks have to be seen to be believed. No plugs or even hole grids in the sinks. The &quot;wet room&quot; had shower curtain hanging from a fan of galvanized wire which would be more appropriate for  garden use.This was a twin room meaning 2 separate rooms with single beds, which could be tolerated although not what we were expecting.

The hotel offers its guests a hotel tour, at 2pm most days, booked in advance with the very helpful concierge staff. On our tour, we saw all the museum aspects of the hotel, which is built over an archaeological site of the beginnings of the city. We also saw several suites, each with its own special character and features. Each room has its own little shard or item from the city's colonial history. So many other features: plush bathrobes, a &quot;good-night&quot; note - personalized! - on our pillow, a spacious, modern gym and a delightful reading nook donstairs by the bar. We ate light late suppers twice at the hotel's excellent bar cafe; one night there was very good live jazz.

667083258,"Fortunately the air conditioning unit in my room was so loud that it drowned out the roar of the traffic from the 10 lane highway running alongside the premises. Unfortunately it wasnât loud enough to mask the sound of other guests walking past my door all night. La Quinta seem to have pulled off an acoustic miracle as the concrete walkways manage to project the sound of footsteps and voices into the room so that it actually sounds like other guests are in the bedroom with you! Somebody at Sonos should hire these guys. After the first night I tried to cut my stay short but between the unhelpful, ambivalent staff at the motel and the incompetence of booking.com I ended up staying a second dreadful night before escaping to a decent hotel. La Quinta misleadingly describe the location as âSea Worldâ, but it is really Mission Valley, known locally as auto alley due to all of the car dealerships. For the record Mission Valley has one of the highest crime rates in San Diego at 278pc higher than the national average. I know you get what you pay for but if you have children or value your safety I urge you to spend the extra 20pc and get a great 3 or 4 star hotel in La Jolla instead - itâs just 20 mins away and one of the safest neighbourhoods in SD.",-1,0.429

They were accomodating, friendly and had great suggestions on restaurants and things to do.  The bar has great views and great cocktails, although we had one bartender who wasn't quite up to the standards of the rest of the staff, but we did not let that ruin our stay.

This hotel is ultra modern. I love the style, but maybe you will not be so enthusiastic.  I have single occupancy of a double room.  It's a large room but no balcony.  Great bathroom also, and with a spacious shower cubicle.  It all looks so new, and incredibly clean.  It's in a quiet location so sleep quality is very good, and you get a great breakfast, the usual Italian fare.  Just don't expect too much from the sausage and powdered scrambled eggs.  I feel this hotel is more for business travelers than tourists although both are catered for.  Staff are very efficient although I have not needed to interact with them very much so can't comment on their service.  I have not found any shops nearby, there is an onsite restaurant and a pizza  restaurant/ bar just up the road.  I have not tried either.  My only (minor) negative comments are that the TV, although very modern, is quite small, and the bed is somewhat firm. To sum up, if you don't mind riding the bus into town (â¬1.20 for any journey up to 70 minutes) and you don't mind the lack of nearby facilities/ shops), this is a good choice of hotel).

While I was in this piece of dump I realized I had to get out of there quick, but since it was almost midnight, I had NO choice, not to mention the parking space is limited to like three cars or something. This place is really something, the bathroom and the bedroom was horrible and the street noise was so intensly loud it felt like I was in the movie theathers (without the enjoyment). Also the carpet was like crawling heavily with bugs and fleas and kept biting me and my boy badly. I hate bugs in hotel, they tell me that the hotel is not a good establishment and should be regulated strongly by the federal government or something. Please I just want to get rid of this memory of horrendousness and terrifying noises that seemed to penetrate my soul with a huge sword of doom. The only good part about this &quot;gate to the underworld&quot; was the closeness and the relative ease at finding the resources like groceries and stuff. This was not enjoyable for him or for me.

The highlight was that we could watch the night ski and snowboard exhibitions, wtih fireworks, right from our room.  Spectacular.The staff was great.  There was an accident which blocked traffic on route 99 on the day that we were to arrive, and they e-mailed us to warn of the road conditions and delays.

We are so grateful to have had Ocean Villa to stay at since our second trip to Dog Beach.  Our first trip years ago, Ocean Villa didn't allow dogs, so we had to stay in Point Loma, which is quite a little drive.

The hotel refused to put a rollaway in the room with the two double beds, arguing--probably correctly--that there wasn't enough room. I liked the decor, I don't think it did much for my wife or daughter, though my wife noted the cleanliness value of hardwood floors. The bathrooms were very minimal, a tight flourescent lit space with a toilet and bathtub, though the sinks with their &quot;waterfall&quot; faucets were outside the bathroom. There were two main clerks on duty during our 3 days there--one was fine, the other seemed to come from Slacker Central Casting. Darkness at night--good. The soundproofing was so so, especially when we moved to the larger room closer to Fairfax Ave., but we ran the fan on the heating system and that drowned out traffic. The bed comfort was good, though the rollaway was a bit too springy. My wife was unhappy that the first room had only one chair--the second room had a chair and a rather steeply canted rocking chair. The location is good. The Farmers Market is right across the street and has a bunch of places to both buy fresh food and some very good stands selling prepared food--restaurant level places. You can walk to some other places in the Fairfax, such as the enormous LA County Museum. It's also a short drive to interesting city areas--Hollywood Boulevard, Beverly Hills, West Hollywood etc.  There are hardly any other tourist grade hotels in the area, so it's a bit hard to compare prices.",1,0.4636872586872587

He helped us get our luggage up to our room (no elevator). He was very nice and helpful and told us we could store our luggage there the next day after we checked out of the room so we could make our Leaning Tower tour time. The room itself was a small basic room with 4 single beds (a quad room) and a small bathroom. From our room, there is no view of the Tower. We had read about a mosquito problem here and did see a couple, but were never actually bitten in our room. Our room faced the road and the road noise was horrible!! Our air wouldn't work. After asking a couple of times about it the young guy said he was coming to our room in 5 mins, but he never showed. However, the air mysteriously kicked on after we complained but it never really cooled the room. Breakfast is included and it was very basic. The receptionist the following morning (a young lady) wasn't very friendly, barely even acknowledging us. Although she did store our luggage, she let us know they do not store luggage but she would go ahead and do it. The hotel is about a 10 min walk from the Leaning Tower and is located on a very busy, main road with lots of traffic. You need a code after dark to get in the gate.

235412896,"Must admit wasn't initially blown away  - located in narrow little street off the south side if the Arno, our 2nd floor room was snug with no view just an internal light well. However - like Pisa it grew on me . It was really clean and quiet with efficient AC - the murals throughout the hotel are really good and made me smile on many occasions. Did what was needed  - clean quiet and efficient - didn't like the eighties style wall mounted hairdryer and the fact that the advertised terrace is in fact a first floor garage roof that hadn' t been swept clean of falling tree debris for some time when we investigated.",1,0.3933333333333333
224131775,"...so I might as well list them as I can think of them.1. Poor check in experience. I had to wait 15+ minutes to check-in because there was only one clerk for this large property, and that clerk was trying to reassure another guest who had a dispute over his bill. Had another clerk not finally come out, it could have been over an hour (see next paragraph). I had just come from a multi-state road trip and all I wanted to do is go to my room, put my stuff away, and go to bed. 2. Room keys were unreliable at beginning of stay. My room was in a tower at the diagonally opposite corner of this property which is the size of a couple of city blocks. I get there and the keys kinda worked the first time, but because of a lack of luggage carts (to be mentioned later) I had to make multiple trips to the car. On my return trip, my friend and I have been locked out. So back to the desk again, on the other side of the property, where we got new keys after another lengthy wait because the first clerk was STILL dealing with the customer with the billing issue. The new keys were also flaky and only worked if you slowly inserted them and slowly removed them. As we had more stuff in the car to remove, I told my friend to stay in the room lest we be locked out again. The lock was changed out the next morning but I didn't know that until after I returned from my conference classes, so back to the front desk again...3. Lack of luggage carts. We were told at the first conference luncheon that the reason there were no luggage carts was because kids were playing with them and even throwing them into the San Diego River behind the hotel. Well, that doesn't seem to be an issue with other hotels....they either keep a better eye on their property, or simply accept the vandalism as a part of life. We were told to take advantage of the hotel's free bellhop service...which I was not offered when I checked-in. And even if I did, the bellhops were not in the lobby (presuming they were out helping someone else) so yet another wait.4. Overall shabby condition of the hotel. Conference attendees were allegedly promised the most recently-renovated rooms. While our room in the Regency Tower had newer, unstained carpeting and bamboo floors, the wallpaper was peeling in places and had poorly-patched sections. The hallway and room windows were filthy and the hallway carpeting did not appear to have been vacuumed in over a week. A pile of dishes from the room service of the room across the hall sat in the hall for over 48 hours. My A/C only worked if turned on full blast because per the technician sent to my room &quot;it doesn't work between 68 and 72 degrees&quot; so it's either freeze or swelter in the humidity. There was a nice rust stain on the tub below the faucet. Other parts of the hotel remind me of those run-down hotels in Hawaii from the 60's and 70's that had seen better days, like creaky elevators and an overall &quot;beat up&quot; looking appearance. It's an excellent candidate for the Travel Channel's &quot;Hotel Impossible&quot; series.5. Poor and/or overpriced amenities. For the conference we were not charged the resort fee, but even without it I thought this hotel was a poor value for money. The hotel's WiFi is extremely iffy and does not work at all in the conference areas. This was a complaint as well by other conference attendees and instructors. I had to print out two pages of an email as it contained tickets for an event my friend and I were going to, and by the time I paid for the computer rental fee and the per-page fee it cost me nearly $10. I didn't bother with the restaurants after seeing the prices on the menus. Attendees for my conference were only charged $1/day for parking, otherwise it's $14 and it's still a long walk due to the size of the property.6. Poor last-day experience. The day before I was due to check-out, I called the front desk and asked about late-check out, as I still had a class that morning and I didn't want to leave my belongings in the car. I was told for $35 I could check out at 1:30 PM instead of noon, and I told them I would do that. On my way back from dinner, I stopped by the desk to confirm that I am allowed late check-out. I was told at that time that the $35 fee allowed me to check out at 3 PM, not 1:30, and again confirmed my room was slated for late check-out. Yet, I found myself locked out of my room at 1 PM that day. The maid nearby called her supervisor, but because the maid totally mispronounced the name on my driver's license (to confirm I rented that room), the supervisor claimed that she doesn't see that name associated with that room. After I admittedly raised the tone of my voice to express my irritation with this latest addition to my overall bad experience at this hotel, the supervisor finally allowed me into my own room so I can check out and never come back.Once that was settled, I had 30 minute wait in a sweltering hot lobby full of people. Many clerks on duty, but simply overwhelmed. I asked about express checkout and the clerk told me that while I could check out via the TV (which was never mentioned to me before), &quot;it sometimes doesn't work.&quot; How about sliding the bill under the door with all the charges like other hotels do? That way you only need to visit the desk if there is a billing issue.All week, including the last day, I had been in contact with Senior Conference Services Manager Felipe Ortiz, who first heard of my horrible first night's experience via my complaint to the association whose conference I was attending. While some of the issues were addressed (cleanliness of the hallway, door lock being eventually replaced), others (filthy windows, A/C that only works full blast, crappy WiFi) were not. After I complained to him about the debacle over late check-out, the only thing he was able to offer me for my poor experience at this hotel was to not charge me the $35 late fee. His reply to the WiFi issue was to refer me to a technical support number. Felipe, it's not a technical support issue...your property needs to buy additional bandwidth and install more wireless access points, particularly in the conference areas.",-1,0.5071375778692855

The quality of the room was fantastic and the location of the hotel was perfect near to a lot of the attractions in the historic part of the city. I must say the front desk staff were superb, they couldn't do enough for me. So helpful and extremely professional. I also ate in the restaurant Toast and had a relaxed and delicious meal.The only thing I would pick up on was the breakfast it could be a bit more adventurous in terms of more fruit and providing various yoghurts.Despite that, I had a perfect stay and would thoroughly recommend this lovely boutique hotel to anyone!!",1,0.6225

597313692,"This is one of those times when a lengthy review seemed appropriate...Like all things in life, there usually is a silver-lining if you look hard enough.  Unfortunately, we were not provided with the level of service we anticipated during our stay prompting us to submit an unflattering review with only a 2 rating.  However, our silver-lining following this trip was the responsiveness of hotel upper management to our original TripAdvisor post; which I decided to amend with added detail. From our perspective, services and accommodations were a miss falling below our expectations.  My wife and I stayed at CF for 6 nights between June 30 and July 6, 2018.  Although we were impressed with the exterior architecture of the hotel, the location, and the history of the property; we soon found that the property was less than anticipated at what is described as a &quot;5 Star&quot; premium hotel.  We are frequent travelers and typically stay at recommended properties to ensure that our visit is enjoyable.  Unfortunately, CF missed the mark during our stay.  The property was ill prepared to accommodate guests because of the masses of tourist attempting to get a glimpse at the lobby, retail areas, and escape the heat.  Actual hotel guests became secondary, which is unfortunate and unacceptable.  Restaurants and other public areas are not readily accessible to guests who are paying a premium nightly fee to actually stay on site. Although we stayed on property for almost a week, we were only able to have a few drinks and a cheese platter on one evening at the bar because of the long waits at the eateries during our entire visit.  We finally had to advise the Maitre D' one evening that we were guests at the hotel in wonderment of the lacking accommodations.  This was a significant factor that made the visit disappointing to us.  When paying to stay at a premium property, a guest typically anticipated the opportunity to enjoy the &quot;included&quot; amenities if not for any other reason than the convenience.  Another example; the lobby is not managed well and is not secure.  There are literally tourist everywhere with every seating area being used for weary tourists and shoppers trying to get a break from the heat.  Many are found soundly sleeping in the seating areas and even on the floor as others in their party shop or dine.  The lobby quickly became an area of avoidance with hotel personnel visibly overwhelmed.  The property seems to be well suited for a 1 or 2 night visit; not an extended stay.  Specifically, there is no individualized service.  One would expect a high end hotel to have a mini-fridge available in the room.  One does exist but it is used as a cash bar by the hotel.  As expected, a box of nuts is $9 and a bottle of water is $5 and so on.  We asked about using the mini-fridge for our own wine and beverages and were told by housekeeping staff that we would be charged a $35 fee to remove the pricey hotel items.  This makes a guest feel like they are being gouged especially since the room rates are significant based on the actual accommodations.  Don't let the upscale lobby fool you, the room we stayed in, although large, was extremely dated having a very small bathroom that was only large enough for one person.  Theoretically, we should have had a spectacular view from our room which overlooked the boardwalk and river, but the windows are offset, screened, and don't provide guests with the ability to enjoy the scenery.  Least not forget the noisy and antiquated AC unit.  Expect to be awakened when it activates in the middle of the night.  There are other misses that will disappoint unsuspecting guests who have high expectations for a 5 star property such as the cleanliness of the fitness center and locker rooms, and the management of the pool area.  This needs to be immediately addressed with staff by supervisory personnel.  We were told after our stay that most of the hotel rooms have been recently updated and renovated.  This illustrates the lack of care by staff to accommodate guests staying 6 nights rather than the average 2 nights.  One would anticipate that a guest paying thousands of dollars would be provided consideration and placed in a updated room during an extending stay.  Its the little things in life that sometimes have the greatest impact.  This type of generalized service appeared to be the standard operating practice in most service related areas.    I fortunately received a response from Patricia Carre, Rooms Division Manager after my original review was posted.  I was contacted soon after by phone by Brian OâFlaherty, who is an associate manager.  Mr. O'Flaherty spent nearly an hour and a half on the phone with me.  He was very courteous and receptive.  Mr. O'Flaherty took the time to investigate the issues that we presented.  He documented our conversation advising me that our feedback would be discussed with senior staff.  He acknowledged that the information I provide him was beneficial; making him aware of some fundamental areas for improvement.  He was legitimately concerned with the issues that we discussed and apologetic for what occurred during our stay; advising me that he considered the matter very serious.  We would like to extend our gratitude to Mr. OâFlaherty and Ms. Carre for reaching out to us and taking ownership of what occurred. These managers clearly demonstrate that they stand behind and represent the hotel brand and customers that they serve.  Due to their prompt response, professional demeanor, and consideration; my wife and I; at the urging of Mr. O'Flaherty, will stay at a Fairmont property in the future when the opportunity presents itself. PS - make sure you visit the Citadel located behind the CF.  The daily changing of the guard at 10:00 AM is a great experience.",0,0.5123535525321239
201804698,"This was a pleasure trip for myself and my girlfriend and we were first time visitors to San Diego. We purchased San Diego Go Cards so that we could see several local attractions on our four day visit and decided not to rent a car so we wanted a hotel that offered convenience via shuttle service and proximity to public transportation. We specifically wanted access to the both Seaworld and the Zoo. After reading several reviews and realizing that we may not find exactly everything that we were looking for in one hotel, we found the Handlery to offer the most bang for our buck. The hotel is a two story complex (with no elevators) that is spread out from the main building and offers several other named buildings for housing. We stayed in the Del Mar building which is right off the main Mission Valley Building. We are young and in good shape so we had no issues navigating by foot. The hotel has a very nice pool area. We received an upgrade to a balcony room which was very nice for two people and the bathroom may be considered small by some, but for a family of two, it was enough space. We had a King bed that was very comfortable. The cable was limited, no premium channels but we had no issues with clarity. Although I read a few complaints about the proximity of restaurants in walking distance. We found that the onsite restaurant Postcards offered some good dinner offerings and very good portion sizes that left us stuffed both times. We enjoyed almost everything we had. I highly recommend the bbq chicken pizza (but the mac n cheese wasn't the greatest). There are also a few restaurants in other hotels along Hotel Circle and the Fashion Valley mall is a 5-10 minute walk with several good restaurants including the Cheesecake Factory. The Fashion Valley mall is also adjacent to a transport center which offers bus and train services to Old Town, Downtown/Gaslamp, and many other destinations (All day on off service is available for $5). The hotel offers a great and helpful complimentary shuttle service that we used for dropoff and pickup to Seaworld and the Zoo. They also have an Enterprise Car rental on site as well as a towncar service. There is a hop on and off tour trolley that makes a stop right on site as well. I'd like to thank Makena Catlett who assisted us when there were some discrepancies with the third party site I used to reserve the room. I'd also like to commend the front desk, cleaning, transportation, and restaurant staff who all made us feel welcomed and at home. Based upon our needs for great customer service, cleanliness, transportation and convenience, The Handlery supplied all we needed for a great stay.",1,0.3994883485309016
13368896,"Do not stay at the Andrew Jackson Hotel. I have never experienced any hotel stay like this one in my life. I have stayed at hotels during Christmas and New Years and have never encountered anything like this. (please check my other reviews). My wife &amp; I really wanted to stay at this hotel, instead of a chain hotel. I called the hotel on Dec. 26th to confirm my reservation of a double bed room. The staff said my reservation was fine. I told the staff we would arrive at 10:00 p.m. on Dec. 29th. The moment we checked in there was a problem. The staff told us the heat was broken in our double bed room. (the hotel web site states that the rooms are heated, it was 40 degree weather). I was told they were working on fixing it. Fine, we took a single bed room, our friend was not arriving until the next day. The next morning my wife asked about our double bed room. My wife was shown a double bed room and the front desk clerk stated the maid needed to clean the room first, then it would be ready for us. We went to breakfast, then returned to the hotel an hour later. Upon arriving, the same desk clerk informed us that we could not have the room. When we asked why, we were told we had to call Travelocity, since we did not have a contract with the hotel. My wife asked if their sister hotel St. Pierre had any double bed rooms. The clerk said no. In all the years and places I have travelled, I have never heard of being shown a room, then told I could not have it. Usually, if there is a problem, guests are upgraded, not downgraded. There was no physical way 3 grown adults could even fit into the small single bed they gave us the night before. I called my credit card company with whom I reserved the room with. After they contacted the hotel, they told me to check the hotel St. Pierre. My wife &amp; I walked 3 blocks to that hotel. They indeed had &quot;2&quot; double bed rooms available (we were just told by Andrew Jackson Hotel staff there were no rooms available).  We stayed at hotel St. Pierre until 12/1/08. Please read my review of that hotel. To be fair to the Andrew Jackson hotel, I emailed the G.M. after we returned home, asking why we could not have a double bed room that we had reserved. He replied that he was &quot;vaguely familiar with the situation&quot; and that he would get back with me. I never heard from him again. My credit card company contacted the hotel &amp; the G.M. stated he would resolve the situation with me personally. When I told the credit card company he had not gotten back with me, they contacted him again. The G.M. told the credit card company that the hotel server crashed and he had no information about what happened during my stay. He offered me a 2 free night stay at the hotel. I declined. Why would I go back to this hotel? First my room wasnt available, then it was available, then after it was shown to us, it wasn't available. Their sister hotel had no double rooms available, then it had 2, but the one room with heat (in 40 degree weather) was an extra charge of $20 a night? It has taken me over 1 month to get this situation resolved &amp; I still have no explanation of what happened. I love New Orleans, and I will go back again, but I will never stay at this hotel again.",-1,0.2825475249388294

Staff was very pleasant but housekeeping did NOT rotate linen, including towels and sheets.

In addition, the check in process was confusing, inefficient and extremely inaccurate.  Any time we needed to deal with the front desk, we could count on at least an hour in line to accomplish anything. Calling the front desk was always at least a five minute wait before the call was answered.  I'm not sure why the process is so slow because I've never spent that much time checking in to any hotel.  The rates were not what we were quoted, we were told the rooms we reserved were not available and then people behind us in line were given the rooms we wanted.

421676365,"a very charming hotel in the best spot of the City of QuÃ©bec! it stands out from the city skyline. we knew what we wanted, a comfortable room with a beautiful decoration in a castle. and we got it !!!on of the most curious things is that when you do your reservation, you can put your title (Dr, Prof, King, Prince, Sultan...) we were tempted to call ourselves King&amp;Queen, but we thought that would be too much.the very friendly receptionists did our checkin and showed us to our room. the room was pretty spacious, very elegantly decorated, a king-size bed with lots of fluffy pillows, 2 armchairs, 2 bathrobes!!!!! a bathtub, a big flat-screen tv... it was dreamy!fun fact: when you turn on the TV the basic screen is a greeting from the hotel with your name and title (so if I had put it, it would have shown &quot;Your Majesty King.....&quot;)the bathroom had plenty of utilities which were replaced daily, we remember the soap and moisturizer as having a very pleasant fragrance.you can also access the spa, which consists of massage zones (you had to pay for) and an indoor pool with jacuzzi, where you had a big bowl of fruit for free!! fun fact: in the changing rooms there was a &quot;swimming trunk dryer&quot;, which sort of centrifuged your swimming trunk and left it pretty dry!the hotel hall is pretty elegant, you have a jug with water and lemon, there is a friendly hotel-dog that allows to be petted, there is even a Starbucks in the hotel premises!I cannot evaluate the restaurant, since we had no meal there.the only thing that I found OUTRAGEOUS was, that in a luxury 5* hotel you had to pay for the WiFi in the room!!!!!!! they provided something like a &quot;normal&quot; connection and a &quot;high speed&quot; (I don't remember exactly, but I think it was 16 and 20$ per day) which I found veeeeeeery unpleasant, since you had to walk down to the hall to have internet to speak to your relatives!aside from that, all in all a veeery good experience, comfortable hotel, great sleep quality in enormous bed, and magical stay at a hotel",1,0.6566840277777778

We stayed a Saturday night so had breakfast Sunday morning - now most people will want a later more leisurely breakfast at the weekend. We went down to the breakfast area at 10.15am (check-out was 11am). There was a huge queue - the waitress said there would be about a 15 minute wait as there were no tables. The thing is there were LOADS of tables free but every one was still dirty with used dishes etc... from the previous diners. The staff said &quot;oh we didn't expect everyone to come for breakfast at the same time&quot;.... erm shouldn't hotels be prepared for this.  People were getting very annoyed at having to wait for so long without even a drink of juice (there was no clean glasses either).  We eventually got a table at 10.45 - which meant we couldn't check out by 11 as required.Also - I did request a room at the back of the hotel due to the Manchester 10k race which started right outside the hotel on Portland Street (and I knew i would be wanting to have a lie in) - well my room was right at the front...by the starting line and the noise and loudspeakers started about 8am.I wasn't a happy chappy",0,0.4738389182833628

Wood floor -- a rarity in hotels. Room is very very quiet, and the bed is comfortable.Now the cons: 1. Cleaning. We left around 7:30am and put the cleaning light. We returned at 1pm but the room was not cleaned. I called the front desk, and was told that they only cleaned the stay-in guests in the afternoon, by 4pm. Now that is very inconvenient. One reason I chose this hotel was because their convenient location would allow me to come back in midday and rest a little. And I want to come back to a clean room. I requested the room to be cleaned right away. The front desk basically turned the request down. I found the attitude very unpleasant. They did not even apologize. This is the biggest let-down to me. 2. Shower door did not close well. Water got out every single time and made a small puddle in front of vanity.3.

When we arrived there was no-one at the front desk although they appeared fairly quickly. The desk staff really need some more training in how to welcome guests. There was minimal eye contact and a distinct lack of smiles which was all the more noticeable as we had just come from a really friendly small hotel in Florence. The only words spoken to us were to tell us our room number. A couple checking in next to us were greeted with only one word...&quot;name?&quot; Staff training urgently required. Our room was of adequate size although there was no luggage rack for our suitcase. At the front desk they seemed to be very surprised by our request for one to be brought to our room. An unsmiling lady who did not speak to us at all did bring the requested item a while later. The room seemed to be a mix of older furniture from the days when this was the &quot;Jolly&quot; hotel and attempts by NH to modernise. The two don't quite go together. The built-in clock on the tv was wrong by half an hour.....not much use if you have a train/plane to catch. Good job we had a view of the station clock across the road. Bathroom was lovely. Plenty of toiletries etc. Double glazing very effective so room remained quiet even though it directly faced the train station. Breakfast area was well laid out with a very good choice.

There were double sinks, the shower accommodated two, the soaking tub was deep, and the slate floor in the bathroom heated.

The exterior is a little misleading as its sandwiched unassumingly between two buildings. The interior, however, is just fine. Lobby is small but welcoming with modern touches and complimentary infused water available.  We didn't try the pool (closed early evening) or the rooftop restuarant (had two kids with us and menu sounded a little too fancy for their tastes). It didn't seem like a &quot;kid&quot; hotel, but the staff were so very friendly and welcoming that we didn't feel out of place either. (Ours aren't the sort to go screaming and running throughout the halls anyway). Kids did love having a pet goldfish in our room during our stay which was a nice touch. Valet gave directions without prompting and advice on best routes which was nice as often they're just in a hurry to get you on your way. Front desk staff noted that it was our son's birthday and left a note for him with snacks, drinks, a couple of toy cars and even a little something for his sister so she didn't feel left out. They upgraded us to a mini suite which we loved but the only drawback was a lack of blackout curtains. This didn't phase us much since we planned an early start though.

It is nice and close to Calgary and Nakiska ski area is super close. We were given a spacious room in the signature tower and were more than happy with the food. No, its not top notch as many other reviewers cite, but overall the selection and quality were good. I also like that people can bring their dogs to the hotel. There is a lot to do if you are a family as there is a couple of skating rinks, paved paths and daily entertainment activities.Unfortunately, out check-out ended up on a low note. When I assessed our bill, I noticed a fee of about 3% ($22.47CAD) charged to our bill. It was titled DMF-Destination Marketing Fee. This was not included in the quoted in the taxes and fees when we originally reserved the room online. It was a surprise cost that we were not told about. So naturally, I thought I would do some investigating. I asked the front desk clerk what it was for and she became instantly nervous. She claimed that it was a mandatory fee that all customers had to pay as of January 3 of this year and that the money went to pay for infrastructure within the town of Kananaskis. As it turns out, this is not exactly the case. I contacted the CEO of Tourism Canmore/Kananaskis, the organization which collects and spends the fee, and he informed me that the money is supposedly spent on marketing via social media for the entire region. He sent me a link to some fancy website. Anyway, since we as guests are paying for this marketing, I thought that I would be privy to data that explains, just how our money is spent. Not so. The members, who I assume are hotel managers in the area, are the only ones who have access to this info. Here is a direct quote, &quot;Our member companies pay an annual fee and elect a board from with the membership. We do publish an annual report and audited accounts which are both presented and distributed to our members&quot;. This is totally sketchy. And since the organization is considered non-profit, they probably have access to government grants and such, though they are not actually accountable to the government. What are they hiding? Why do they feel entitled to pass the cost onto their customers? These are the reasons I am angry 1) I was not informed about the DMF upfront 2) When I asked, the front desk was not knowledgeable, nor did they offer to remove the cost from my bill 3) By writing this review, I am providing marketing directly for the hotel and indirectly for the region and the hotel pays me nothing for it. Yet, I had to pay $22.47! In Ontario, this fee is voluntary and I can ask to have it removed from my bill. Apparently, not in Alberta. Certainly, not at the Delta. It is not about the fee as much as the way they went about it. If I knew up front what I was paying I wouldn't have questioned it.",0,0.5014069264069264

Despite staying for two nights, I only ate dinner in the restaurant once because the food was awful (starter warm on the outside, stone cold in the middle; main course a really bad fusion of italian and oriental - and not what the menu suggested).  This was a real disappointment because the food was outstanding the first time I stayed at the hotel.  Breakfast was much better, but attention to detail was lacking (both mornings when I went to put butter on my toast I found the nugget of butter had knife marks and crumbs from the person who had been at the table before me; there didn't seem to be a need to refresh it).

Generally you can find the rates of the hotels around this areas to be slightly cheaper than downtown areas due to lack of view and adjacent to the freeway.  However, to offset this, the rate (as mentioned before) and the proximity to the malls/shopping centers covered up.  Location: As Mentioned above, located right next to the freeway, easy access to La Jolla, Convey, and Downtown San Diego attractions within 10 mins of driving.Parking: Gated, no valet available. I believe it was $12/day.  Bit on the expensive side.Gym &amp; Pool: No fitness center, there's a nice swimming pool (its heated so its warm to swim even at night and Jacuzzi).  I always heard kids having fun at the pool. The pool opens til 11pm at night.Restaurant / Bar: Closed at 11pm.  There's a continental breakfast bar for club level guests on weekends else it'll be served at the bar.Lobby:  Clean and fresh looking sheraton 2.0 look.  Sheraton Link terminals available for use (2 computer terminals) and gift shop located adjacent to the lobby.   Check in was very smooth and quick.

Only suggestion I would make would be to sign up with Fairmont ahead of time so you can get free WiFi in the room.",1,0.7391534391534392
122538815,"This new hotel has some very nice rooms which are well-appointed with modern fixtures. Unfortunately, it also attempts to be a club for 20-somethings, and does not enforce reasonable behavior on the part of its partying guests. So, although it has excellent bones, I cannot recommend it for anyone wanting a guarantee of a good night's sleep.Probably, the problem begins with the (unfortunately all too common) attempt to have both a trendy hangout and a hotel in one property. The hotel has a rooftop deck with a bar and a small swimming pool. This doubles as a club at night. Sadly, the club-goers need to take the elevator to the top floor of the hotel (which has sleeping rooms on it), and then go down a short hall to another elevator to the roof. Why would you do this to your hotel guests?We had a room which was somewhat like a small suite, with nice new fixtures and a cool bath. We did notice with surprise that the carpet was already stained. However, given the discussion below, one can understand why that might be the case.While we were there, there was a multi-night, multi-guestroom party on our floor. The last night we were there, this went on until daylight. The party goers went from room to room, with accompanying door slamming etc. Not only did we complain, but other guests did as well. At one point, we overheard a night clerk telling someone that that was their final warning. As this had no effect, I can only guess that it meant the hotel wouldn't bother them again! We got no sleep that night. The next morning, we complained about the problem. The manager told us how bad he felt about the problem - apparently the night manager had left a message about it. However, what he offered in compensation for completely ruining our visit was laughable.We did take brunch one morning on the rooftop. The staff were hopelessly slow and inept. There is an excellent cafe for breakfast in the strip-mall on the SE corner of Crescent Heights and Wilshire.",0,0.5876972853535354
227612991,"I was in two minds when reading about some earlier reviews but this was the closest option from the airport so decided to go with in anyway...a good decision anyway. It is located less than 10 minutes by foot from Pisa Airport...just get out of Arrivals and cross the road under the flyover....the proporty itself looks a bit deserted on the outside but really this is just because part of the hotel is still under construction. The property is brand new and employs latest gadgetry and technology, some of which can take a little time to figure out. Rooms were large in size, spotless in every way...there was sky tv and we ended up watching a movie(in english!!) after the sightseeing. The staff is extremely helpful with everything...be it directions, transport, water... they are warm and welcoming. The leaning tower is a 25 minute trek from the hotel... but right outside on the main street there is a bus offering point to point connectivity which is great.. we ended up using it on the way back.

Also, the color scheme of the room was relaxing and the bed was supremely comfortable. Internet access was around $9 for the day, and was wireless and very fast. The gym was bigger than what I'm used to for a property of this size, and had well-maintained equipment. I checked out the pool too, and it was large and clean. I did not get a chance to use the restaurant though. This was just a great stay - I highly recommend the Sheraton Mission Valley, and I will definitely stay here again on business trips.

141686653,"This is my 56th review and I tend to be very positive in them. BUT I always tell the truth as I see it and I do report problems AND this hotel was DISAPPOINTING. I felt it was trying to tick boxes for star rating rather than provide a service for us, the travelling public. When I travel I want to feel special. I don't want to be shown small print to prove they are delivering precisely what was promised. (especially if they aren't!!!) Italian hotel star rating is complex.So, is it 4*? Well, the bathroom only had a shower (no bath) and was small. Room window was tiny and blocked by shutters, so dark! Bed was hard. Flooring throughout was tiles, even corridors. So, noisy as people trundled cases. Lift was also noisy. So, a poor night's sleep with late-comers and early departures. We arrived too early for our room. (If you can't meet the contracted time, just say you'd like us to arrive at 1.30 and then we, the travelling public, are not inconvenienced! We arrived expecting to shower and change before lunch: No chance!) 4*? No restaurant (But I wouldn't have dined in a hotel anyway)Free Shuttle to airport -but only if you book direct with the hotel -why? Curiously, they feature TripAdvisor strongly in their marketing, but if you book this way you don't qualify for a free shuttle to airport. I don't think this is clear enough on their website - but frequent reposts by the management on this forum do make that point. Not sure you'd want to rely on their airport service anyway: our (limited) observations suggested late departures and fully booked shuttles. AND, at 5 euros per person, could be more expensive than the taxi  costing 13 euros. Breakfast was ok, nothing special. 4*? Not at all. Limited restaurants close by. 20 min walk to the &quot;tower&quot; and to other reasonable quality restaurants. Overall: Pisa is a day trip from other central Tuscan locations. Only 7 euros from Florence by train, say, so do a day trip and save the bother of an overnight stay, even if you're flying in and out of Pisa. Hotel Bologna: cheap 3*, will suit people with low expectations.",-1,0.5150784852004365

Our room was lovely, spacious, modern and very clean, only downside is the lighting, very subdued, which is not good for applying make up or doing hair, maybe the installation of brighter lighting around the mirrors or in the bathroom would remedy this?? A good selection of complimentary teas and coffees, and delicious biscuits.  Bathroom was modern, smart and spotlessly clean, plenty of hot water whenever you need it.

We have a 3 year old and a baby and the Bologna had no trouble accommodating us. In fact the cot was one of the nicest I've seen, with lovely linen. The room was spacious and the bed very comfortable, although I didn't sleep that well as I left the air conditioning on and got a bit cold (my fault!). As we had to leave before breakfast, the hotel kindly made us up breakfast bags and we had them on the plane.The staff were very helpful, even down to sending on my baby's dolly we left in her cot in the hurry to get out.",1,0.4914529914529915

We went directly to the outdoor plunge pools to start our day. It was a perfect start as we unwound in the hot tub and plunged into the mini pool. Next stop was the pool which was far too cold (and deep). Even though it was over 30 degrees celsius outside, the pool water was freezing. There was also only 3 small umbrella's so very little in the way of shade.The locker room was spacious and free flowing Aveda products abounded. The steam room was ok but we enjoyed the Eucalyptus steam room much more.We both had facials which started with a foot salt scrub. What a great way to enter a relaxing spa treatment! Thoroughly enjoyed it. The waiting area had snacks and lemon spring water. We had to wait several times for clean glasses.Food was good but could use some tweaking. The menu had a good range of choices and you could order anything. My impression of the wait staff was they were run off their feet and just wanted to go home.After lunch we went outdoors to walk the gardens and lounge on the chairs. I wish the loungers would lay flat so people could stretch out but it was very awkward.. They really need to change these chairs. The views are breathtaking, the air was sparkling clean and the sounds of the tree's rustling made it all the more restful.Afternoon tea was delightful, with a choice of more food (like cheese, Hummus, scones and lots of tea choices). I loved afternoon tea on the patio. The spring rolls were really good as was the scones, and other treats.Overall, highly recommend this place. I've traveled all over the world and find Ste. Annes to be right up there with the best of them. Take someone you love for a spa day and you won't be disappointed.",1,0.5994076655052264

I felt betrayed because i called overseas to the hotel, and i spoke with Duty manager for the night name &quot;IN&quot; (if i heard it right), they can not change the room because they are fullybooked. I am really dismay on how they handle customers because it is not responsible of the customer to check the condition of the room they will stay.  I believe it is the resposibility of the hotel to check before giving the room to the customer.  I think, they know it already that the room airconditioned is not working, because they are ready to use fan.  I think they pay for an airconditioned room not a fan room.  They have no emergency solution for that.  I felt terrible.

I had to argue with them for over 30 minutes and wouldn't you know it...they found us a room. However, the front clerk referred to the people who had reserved that room as &quot;poor bastards.&quot; Very Distasteful. This is how they see their customers.  They told me that even though I held the conformation in my hand for a two queen bed room (I had already paid as well) they could not guarantee me a room or the specified accomodations. It is a first come first serve faciltiy. And I could not get reimbursed for the money I paid should I be put in a cheaper room.

There are restaurants and a super variety of shops. This is the oldest part of Quebec City, right across from the cruise terminal. Many of the buildings date from the mid to late 1600's. Going up to the upper city was very easy as the funicular was just a short walk from the hotel.The hotel itself is a wonderful, small boutique that has been totally redone. The rooms are huge, the bed very comfortable, and the shower/bathtub incredible. The tub was a Jacuzzi and the shower was a strong stream rather than the usual weak one you find in hotels. The hotel has a great breakfast. It is a full, served breakfast with egg dishes and crepes and, of course, items on which you can put large amounts of maple syrup. In Quebec this is like having water on the table.The staff was a delight, friendly and helpful. We got to the hotel early in the morning, long before check-in, but they gave us a room right away.

Ha....I'm pretty sure I didn't see any pictures of those God-aweful rooms, because they KNOW that no one would choose to stay in them!  There are much better hotels out there with rooms much bigger and nicer, and less expensive.  I felt duped, to say the least, as we trusted Hotwire and this hotel to give us a 3 star room, since that is what we bid on!  Oh, and just a tip for those other guests who didn't like the musty smell of the rooms....always travel with a scented candle and firestarter...they work miracles in hotel rooms, and give you a nice glow at night while watching tv! :)  I really can't say anything positive about this place, honestly.  From check-in, paid parking (right! what parking!), no wi-fi (had to call and complain, and I was given a coupon code to use), hard uncomfortable beds, terribly small room with 2 queen beds...I can go on and on, but I won't.  It definitely wasn't anything close to the beautiful rooms I was admiring on their website after we bid on Hotwire and got $71 for a 3 star room!  We were so jazzed, as we saw the room rates varying from $125 to over $200!  So, be careful when you book this hotel...you really won't know what you are getting.  I suggest that the hotel be more responsible, and show that extra block of rooms from the 1960's and just offer those at the low rate of $70's if people like the location and ammenitites but can't quite afford the nice rooms in the tower.  I will never stay here again, if I can't be sure that I'm getting the room I reserve based on pictures.  We were so unhappy with it, we left after 2 nights, even though we paid for 3.

An iron, a kettle, an ironing board, subtle room lighting, a decent tv, wi-fi that worked without issue, and an immaculate bathroom.The beds were extremely comfortable and you're even provided with a choice of soft or firm pillows.Breakfast was included, and my only complaint was the hot food wasn't that good. The choice (or lack of) was small - (powdered) scrambled eggs, tasteless sausages and beans...... However, the selection of cereals, breads, toast, condiments, fruits, muffins, coffees and juices was more than ample, and for most people would be most acceptable.The hotel is literally a two minute walk from a Frankie and Bennys, a Chiquitto's, a Vue Cinema complex, and a large Asda store. There's a good selection of pubs within a five minute stroll of this accommodation too.

The solo serverwas very scattered and kept apologizing as she searched for jam, cream, butter etc.The charge for this mish mash of a continental breakfast was $19,00 per person and neither the service, nor the food warranted that price. It was certainly not worthy of the Relais ChÃ¢teau brand.We ordered room service for breakfast one morning. The cream and milk were missing.

It turned out to be a room with special facilities for the handicapped (also the bathroom looked a bit hospital-like). So it wasn't very cosy but must be quite convenient for handicapped travellers, even with a wheelchair. The restaurant is very expensive - for we didn't eat there I can't tell about the quality. The surroundings of the hotel don't have any touristic or cultural interest, just apartment blocks and a commercial center in front of the hotel. The hotel is very easy to reach by car from the motorway or the airport and there is a free car park behind. It takes about 20 to 30 minutes to walk to the city center, even longer to the Leaning Tower and the duomo. There must be also a bus connection, a bus stop is near the hotel at the busy street in front of it.I strongly recommend to go to the historical center for dining, there are lots of good restaurants that are not as touristic as in Florence or Siena (e.g. Osteria del Tinti, Vicolo del Tinti 26).

The carpets throughout are disgusting.  Breakfast is a farce as they only have one teapot and one coffee pot and it is waiter served - you can wait for half an hour to catch him to get a drink or you could just give up and get one outside!  Replenishment of  the food platters takes a while too.  The staff are very pleasant and helpful.

I was worried about this before we even got there, but it felt cheap and dirty. We dropped off our luggage and ventured out to get some dinner. When we returned I just didn't feel comfortable enough with my two year old getting on the beds and floors so I unpacked my emergency sheet sets. When I pulled back one of the covers, I found BODILY fluids on the comforter. I completely freaked out and had my husband go ask for a refund and packed up our things. Refund or not I was not staying there.

So, my husband ended up just going down to the front desk to get it himself.  LOL!  Another thing is that please people don&#39;t be shocked about the extra charges for parking and stuff.  I think it&#39;s about $22/day.  It&#39;s the city...expect it now a days.

Not a fan of stuff that has been sitting there for god knows how long.  And they didn't seem to have that much business that morning, so I'm sure the food would taste and look less appetizing.

We ended up going out for breakfast each of the remaining days.  There was a local coffee place called &quot;The Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf&quot;......pastries looked good until I saw the horde of fruit flies in the pastry box....walked out.  Just a warning.

Even my 6 year old eats the salmon prepared there...and that says a lot from small picky eaters!

It really is strange driving there bc you would not expect a hotel there!Stayed here for a work &quot;retreat&quot; once and the service was great. Food was always provided and the staff were very helpful. We had dinner at the hotel and it was great! Also stayed here with the hubby and 18 mo old for a night when we were in the middle of moving. Check in was really quick - i think they could tell we were tired and just wanted to go to the room.  The rooms are comfy and fairly sound proof as well! There was some sort of doctors convention/retreat there when we stayed as a family and as loud as they were, you couldn't hear them in the room! The room also had plenty of space for our son to run around and he loved the grounds. Their breakfast buffet is sooooooo amazingly good - it's worth either paying for it or getting a package deal where it comes with the room. There is someone there making custom ommies and they have a huge selection of premade hot food and pastries.

I phoned the hotel and she arranged for Security to retrieve it and said they would mail it to me. I did have to follow up a week later with phone calls and emails, but that was not her fault-the one with custody of the items dropped the ball, according to the response from the hotel. Ms Jackson's prompt assistance was invaluable. The other positives: the beds, linens and pillows were VERY comfortable and clean; responsive AC/heating thermostat. Negative: no information in the room at all about how to connect to internet, find tv news, where to eat, etc. Also, one key did not work and the other as well as the replacement were difficult to use.",1,0.5349999999999999

We lucked out and Sappyfest was going on when we were there so sitting at a table on the patio was very nice and we only had to walk a couple of minutes to get back to the Inn.  So comes the bad.. we arrived for check in at almost 5pm, check in starts at 3pm.  We had to ring the bell at the front desk 3 times and waited approx 15 mins to find someone to check us in.  We got the room key, went to our room and within about 5 mins had a knock at the door, the cleaning lady letting us know she wasn't done cleaning the room and still needed to finish the bed and clean the washroom.  The room was small and missing pieces of flooring, clock that didn't work, and not nearly what I was expecting from the pics I saw.  We were in the carriage house not the main Inn so maybe the rooms in the main Inn are better.  When leaving this morning to check out at 9:30am again I rang the bell and waited.. and waited.. rang the bell again, waiting again.  Finally hit the bell as hard as humanly possible and a few minutes later the man appeared so I could finally pay him and leave.  He was not friendly at check in or check out.  Their customer service needs a LOT of work.  The gardens that they boast about are not well taken care of and are just the typical plants you see growing on the side of the road on their own.

There is a very slow (only one) elevator to get to the rooms and it can hold barely 4 adults let alone bags ..this elevator is very busy during breakfast and checkout times.

175162975,We stayed here two nights. Had a lovely room with a very nice balcony. Hotel is a typical old Italian building. Lots of marble everywhere! The staff at reception and breakfast were lovely and very friendly. We were welcomed by name when we turned up. We used a taxi from the airport which cost 10e which I thought was reasonable.Breakfast was best we had on our tour in Italy - lots of choice including some hot food. Coffee was lovely. Only downside was the entrance to the hotel was not on the main street but via an arcade of shops which felt a little unsafe as I was travelling alone with my children.  However I didn't see any trouble and would certainly stay at this hotel again so it obviously wasn't too bad.The hotel was 1 minute from Pisa Central station so extremely convenient. We also walked to the Tower. I couldn't get the air con to work so it did get very hot at night. However I didn't raise this with the hotel at the time.Overall excellent value for a centrally located hotel.,1,0.5883219954648526

It has a clinical feel to it and when I was there this was made worse by the fact that there was no one else staying.  The location is not good if you want to visit the leaning tower.  The breakfast is bland and limited and not up to general Italian standards.

82490377,"I stayed at this Hotel for 2 nights my departure being on the day the Ash problem arose from Iceland, but I was one of the fortunates to find accommodation in a different hotel for the next 10 days as the Bologna Hotel was fully booked.However, my stay at the Bologna did not go too well really, being a solo traveller, I had booked a single room but the room I was given felt more like a cell as the window had bars and was about 8ft high up so you could not see out and the wardrobe had hanging space for items no more than 45cm long(?).. very weird because even a man's jacket couldn't fit.  Anyway, I immediately went back to reception but the best they could offer was a move in the morning, but as I was going on a trip to Florence in the morning I said not to bother.  However, the noise from the bakery on the second night was just unbelievable, so much so when I telephoned reception during the night the receptionist could hardly hear me, and I am not kidding!  (Funnily enough I did not hear the bakery noise on the first night?)  Anyway, on my departure day I did ask the Manager to come and view my room pointing out the problems, ie window/hanging space, and to give him his due he &quot;insisted&quot; I be refunded for one night which I was certainly not expecting as I was merely pointing out the lack of comfort/design? OK that's the complaints part over, now for the good news: I would like to sing their praises for the help and assistance I received from the Reception staff even after moving out of the hotel as they allowed me to use their computer!

46565487,"I decided to book a 2-night stay with my mother at Ste. Anne's in July. I had heard a number of great things about St. Anne's and couldn't wait to get there for some much-needed luxury R&amp;R. I was also scouting out the spa to see if it would be the spot for a relaxing bachelorette party. I came out of my time at Ste. Anne's feeling as though I had wasted precious time and money and I will definitely not be returning. I have also advised all of my friends not to waste their hard earned money on Ste. Anne's unless they had no other option (e.g. travel or time restrictions).I have to agree with some of the comments cited in the terrible/poor and average categories on tripadvisor. Having stayed in numerous spas in every continent ex-Antarctica and in most of the 60-odd countries I have visited, I have to wonder whether the people who give the reviews for Ste. Anne's have a) never been outside of Canada (or even Ontario for that matter) or b) never been to a top-notch spa before.I will start with the positives since not everything was negative. We stayed in the Hudson Bay room and it was fantastic. Our room was our refuge. I'm not sure what we would have done if we hadn't been able to escape from the hoards of people into such a nice hideaway. We also really enjoyed the outdoor pool, the grotto area and the group classes. I would also note that the woman who helped me with my original booking was great. Her name was Johnna.The treatments were decent, not fantastic and the trails were fine but extremely short (maybe I'm just a fast walker) and not that interesting.Moving on to the negatives. It look an extremely long time to check-in. It was essentially chaos in the entrance. I've never seen a spa-hotel that has the check-in desk for the spa (including day spa) right beside the check-in for the hotel/accomodation. I felt like walking right back out the door. People were everywhere and there was no space to sit so we stood until space became available and we could start filling out our forms. It was a train station; there's no other way to describe it.The trash bin our room hadn't been cleared and a lightbulb was out - not a big deal and we had it fixed (after waiting for over 20mins for someone to give us attention at the front desk) but honestly, when you're paying $1,000/day this shouldn't happen. It was also unacceptable that we could not receive phone calls. A family member called to say that the basement was leaking and he was not allowed to be connected to us and nor were we informed that he had called.We went downstairs and were immediately bombarded by the overflowing waiting room for treatments. Again, a faux pas for a luxury spa. The gym is the size of a shoebox and right outside of the dining room. I found it utterly disturbing that the group classes for the hikes began right outside the steam room. It was annoying that one had to walk through the store in order to get to the dining room, the grotto, steam room and the gym. In the end, we just started going outside to avoid this. The treatments that are in the &quot;old&quot; part make you feel like you're in someone's basement and it's highly unpleasant. Lastly, the change room was unbelieveably messy. In short, the layout of the main house is terrible. There are too many people for the house to be relaxing and the front desk constantly seems overwhelmed and/or understaffed (we had a joke amongst the guests that if you wanted to check out at 11am you should get to the desk at 10am).  I've eaten at a lot of the top restaurants in the world and as such, I have to say that the food was terrible ex-breakfast. The food wasn't bland, it was just bad. My comments relate mostly to the lunch although dinner wasn't anything to write home about. Don't get the pizza, it's horrendous. I also think the spa could do with changing the menu for lunch and dinner because some of the options left me less than excited and I unfortunately had to choose amongst the same set of options for multiple meals.  Afternoon tea was ok but not great. The tea was good.Overall, I'd say save your money and go somewhere worthwhile and memorable because for that amount of cash; it should be. All I feel is regret.",0,0.5125384979862592
88938513,"Okay, the Wilshire Crest is not the most glamorous hotel you'll ever see. Although it has pleasant common rooms and a courtyard, it has the air of an assisted-living facility that was recently repurposed as a hotel. The rooms are spacious, but the decor is not particularly stylish. The breakfast is not that impressive: just a few cereals, and commercial pastries and bagels. However, everything is comfortable and clean, with at least a little charm, and the location is perfect for many Los Angeles landmarks. If you want to visit LACMA or the La Brea tar pits, all you have to do is walk a couple of blocks. The trendy little restaurants of 3rd St. are an easy distance for a walker, as is the giant Grove shopping center. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is just a 5-minute drive away, and it's also a short drive to Hollywood Boulevard and Melrose Avenue, etc. The Wilshire Crest is located in one of my favorite residential neighborhoods in LA; you'll be surrounded by quiet and cute 1920's and 1940's houses and Spanish-flavor apartment buildings; you could forget the main strip of Wilshire is so close by. There is only street parking, but the staff will give you a tag to hang on your rear-view mirror, so you can park in the neighborhood for free. (The area is pretty safe, but this being a big city, I would still be careful about your belongings.) This was my first time using a hotel's wi-fi--the Wilshire Crest's worked perfectly. The staff were all very nice and friendly, and I got the impression they have a lot of repeat visitors.

It's the best place when you need to unwind from daily stresses or simply to relax and reflect with good friends. Ste. Anne's holds a very special place in my heart.  My mom took my sisters and me there two years in a row.  She passed away in the summer and I have wonderful memories of being able to get away and spend quality time with mom, something we don't often do in the city.  Each room is different and has its own unique qualities, so no two visits are alike.  I have had many different treatments and have thoroughly enjoyed each visit.  The food and its presentation are equal to the best restaurant in any big city.  Recently my husband and I tried another spa outside of Toronto and although we enjoyed our time at that spa, the treatments could not compare to those offered at Ste.

566176399,"The Hotel Wilshire was my very first Kimpton experience. Just checked out a few hours ago and as a low level Platinum member (not Spire, nor Invitation-Only Inner Circle), I was absolutely impressed with the sincerity and warmth that came with the customer service during my short one night stay.I want to specifically mention two individuals to the GM Jessica: Johnson and Chrissia. I may have gotten lucky, but they made my stay very memorable and I will continue to cultivate my relationship with this property as the Wilshire has become my gateway property that introduced me to the Kimpton hospitality legends of lore.Due to my schedule, I regularly check-in at 3AM which ultimately limits my interactions to very specific graveyard personalities and single staff shifts unless you are at a massive airport hub property. Johnson was the guy that made the check-in experience very lively with great conversations and had spent over 1.5 hours answering all my questions about the Kimpton loyalty benefits. Johnson was also very accommodating with some of my requests due to availability even though I was only a Platinum. He loved talking about Kimpton and other guests may have just assumed that I was Johnsons friend. This was critical for me because Johnson served as my very first Kimpton point of contact. I encourage everyone to hang around the front desk after hours to meet him. He will enjoy speaking with you.Upon checkout, I had a slight billing issue related to my prepaid deposits under the wrong credit card. This was my mistake, but the issue did not require a special operation counterstrike team to correct the matter. However, Chrissia exemplified a level of enthusiasm and proactiveness that helped me understand the Kimpton culture. I was surprised at how accommodating she was and spent some time thinking about how to fix the problem I had created.Their personalities and willingness to help their guests whenever possible was the secret that really distinguished the Kimpton experience from many other brands. They first said &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;Let Me See&quot; before they said &quot;No&quot;. I noticed this very easily because I was already visiting the property with a certain level of bias and ready to test the merits of the Kimpton Brand.One could argue that my experience was hardly anything to rave about and just an isolated incident of âsuccessâ. True. Possibly. However, I typically spend many months at SPG, Hyatt, and Hilton Properties so I have experienced a vast array of hiring practices. Does anyone need to ask a Wal-Mart manager the kind of people they hire? No.My friends who are Kimpton Inner Circle snobs with 50+ nights per year have always called me out for getting BS customer service from the other brands and being ignorant of the extremely CONSISTENT benefits from customized personal service at each Kimpton property (if cultivated and nurtured properly). Kimpton was never necessary for me given their limited scope and global reach, but my friends describe the Kimpton experience as a special &quot;Inner Circle&quot; family and that the relationship only gets stronger the more you stay. We are not talking about your âHit It &amp; Quit Itâ stays or your 1k Facebook and Instagram friends. We are talking about real people and real relationships in real life. Not your Netflix and Chill. Your success at building that connection at SPG, Hyatt and Hilton is very limited given their massive footprint. Many times your Platinum, Globalist or Diamond status is overlooked simply because they hate their job.My interactions with Johnson and Chrissia assisted me to understand the benefits of the Kimpton Inner Circle program level. Lower levels may do just fine for some, but a higher level of patronage coupled with the service culture of the Kimpton brand is what really sets this boutique property from the other massive brands. Donât waste it. I encourage everyone to make awesome friends at your favorite properties to make your stay more personal and exciting. If building relationships sound ludicrous to you for just a hotel stay, then I suggest you check out the Holiday In. They have great people working there.",1,0.5261774747885858

There is nothing to do in the evening at the hotel, You can walk into Pisa about 20 mins, across the main road and through the underpass, be careful  when in the underpass, we had a couple of near misses with cyclists passing through, you can't  hear them it's quite noisy, they go quite fast on the bike. There is a supermarket the other side of  the underpass called PAM it's quite useful has everything you might need. We got the train to  Florence from Pisa main train station, you can get the bus outside the hotel to the station, it was 15.80 euros return to Florence, a pleasant train journey about one and half hours, be sure to  validate your ticket once you purchased it, there are machines on the wall inside the station  otherwise you will be fined, you have to do it again on the return journey, We found everyone at Pisa very friendly and helpful both restaurants and bars, there is a nice market in Pisa on Wed and Saturdays, we walked back from the market and saw some lovely sights. We are looking forward to returning to Pisa but not at  Abitalia, we didn't find the staff very friendly or helpful, we never bothered the staff after the first few days,  we feel this was more for business people it's not family friendly, most people seem to only stay one or two nights while we was there.",0,0.5381784746418892

The toilet barely flushed and the shower head had so much lime and grime that it sprayed in all different directions. Considering there is no shower door, the bathroom was perpetually soaked.

I travel to San Diego frequently to visit my daughter, and have stayed at a different hotel each time; while I haven't had any terrible experiences, none have drawn me to book a return visit - until now. The Town and Country is just what I have been searching for in San Diego. It's the little things that all come together to distinguish this property from the rest:- The friendly and accommodating staff - from Audrey at the front desk, to the housekeeping staff, to the clerk in the cafe, to Andrea at Charley's - everyone we encountered was terrific. This must come from leadership and expectations at the top, and I hope they keep doing what they're doing!- The decor and furnishings in the room were great and made for a room you could really hang out in and enjoy. Our room had two sinks: one inside and one just outside the bathroom - love this feature. Huge private balcony overlooking the pool. We also had a small settee, chair, and coffee table, which added to the comfort and usability of the room.- Cafe and restaurant on-site with good variety and reasonable prices.- The inflatable ducks (and one unicorn) in the pool - made me smile every time I looked out there. - The bed was quite comfortable.The hotel is also conveniently located next to the trolley line and Fashion Valley Mall - an added bonus.We are looking forward to our next visit to San Diego and the Town and Country!",1,0.5104166666666666

I knew I wanted to stay in a mid-size hotel in the old section, but I didn't realize that this hotel (as well as a number of others I was considering) was outside of the QC walls. Although the location (old, lower city) was not what I intended when I booked, it was more than perfect. The old city has an upper and lower part, with different vibes. Although the upper city is beautiful and very french, with great restaurants, sites, and art galleries, it is on a larger scale than the old city beneath the wall (old fortification). In the lower city there are many great hotels, restaurants, galleries, shops, the St. Lawrence,the Place Royale, and the Museum of Civilization, in a &quot;tight&quot; older european style village. It was so much fun to be able to explore the whole area of 17th and 18th century architecture, narrow cobblestone streets, and occasionally walk or take the funicular right up to the Champlain plazza by the Hotel Fontennac. A two hour tour of the old upper section was a good overview and gave us an idea of where we wanted to return at our leisure in the upper city. Both upper and lower city had street entertainers. If you don't want a long excursion down the St. Lawrence, there is a ferry that inexpensively crosses the St. Lawrence to the town of Levi; it is well worth the view and the short ride there and back. The Hotel 71 was modern, clean and close to everything. We passed on the really expensive restaurants, although most of the restaurants around the tourist areas were not cheap.

I appreciated the fact that Shane gave me a tour of the whole house so that I could trust in the quality of the establishment. Shane has thought of everything. I forgot my toothpaste at home and every room has toothpaste, toothbrushes and other things that you might have forgotten.  There are not enough good things that I can say about this place.

It is just next door on the boardwalk from the bigger hotel, and more a part of the city since it is directly above the action.  The staff was lovely to deal with, parking was easy, the room with a kitchen and living area provided us with the amenities to make dinner and visit with our college-age daughter very comfortably.  We also had a nice chat with nice couple while eating the hotel breakfast in an outside seating area.

The service was amazing.  Whenever we walked in the door, someone asked if they could assist us.  I found the main areas smaller than some of the other old CP hotels, for instance the Banff Springs or Royal York.  The overall building is massive and we only saw a small part of it.  Our room (a standard double room) was what we expected - no real view, but comfortable beds and enough room that we weren't banging into each other.  The bathroom had been updated, but is still quite small by today's standards.  We didn't eat at the hotel as the prices were jaw dropping, but the concierge was very helpful in finding us other great places to eat.  As has been mentioned the real benefit of staying here is the location.  The view from the Dufferin Terrace is beautiful and you are steps away from either the upper or the lower town.",1,0.4378472222222223

Stayed first and last nights in Pisa, had two nights in Florence and three nights in Venice.Our first and last nights were in the HOTEL MODERNO which is situated in the centre of Pisa and is only about 200yds from the railway and bus stations.It is nice walk to the leaning tower which will only take about 20 mins.. Moderno is a family hotel and is run by Maurisio and his daughter Chiara. They both speak good english. We had an upstairs room at the back which was quite large, very quiet, and clean.  Breakfast was ample. On asking Maurisio advice on a nice local restaurant he directed me to Ristornate 'LO SCHIACCIANOCI'.  He informed me - 'Don't look at the outside, have a look inside'.He was correct.  This lovely little family owned restaurant, run by Giovanni and his wife, was really good and far from expensive.  It's where the locals go.  We enjoyed it so much that when we returned to Pisa for our last night in Italy , there was no doubt as to where we were going to eat.

Not to mention there is a skating pond, outdoor skating rink, swimming pool with indoor/outdoor hot tub, tobogganing hill, and outdoor walking paths to take in the scenic Rocky Mountains. If you are into skiing Nakiska ski resorts is only a five minute drive away (and I think there is a free shuttle between the hotel and ski resort).While the rooms are not lavish, they are spacious and clean and the beds are very comfortable and ours had a great view of the mountains.

We were neither rude nor negative but we got immediate blowback from the clerk.  When we asked to speak to the manager; he said he was the manager.  And that explains it all.

460438616,"At the Andrew Jackson, it's all about location!  On Royal, one street over from Bourbon, it's close to the party, but much quieter.  It's a cute historic hotel with all the New Orleans charm.  Don't expect it to be new and modern and you won't be disappointed.  The rooms are a little small.  There is no elevator and the stairs are steep.  The hallways are narrow, but all that is to be expected in an old place.  They have done updating to the rooms.  The beds are comfortable and I had no issues with hot water or water pressure in my room.  I originally booked a room with 2 queen beds but a couple days before my trip I received a call stating that they were doing some renovations and we were asked if we would mind having 2 rooms with single beds instead.  I was traveling with my brother so this worked out perfectly. We arrived before check-in and they had one of the rooms ready and allowed to check in early.  My room ended up being a queen bed and there was a nice welcome gift on the bed.  I was also greeted by the gentlemen who asked me about having 2 rooms and he personally thanked me for our willingness to change plans - even though I felt like we got the better deal by having 2 rooms.The staff at the front desk were always friendly and helpful.  My one and only complaint is that you are supposed to get a free breakfast delivered to your room (or the courtyard if you prefer).  They have cards you are supposed to fill out and leave for staff so they know the time to deliver your breakfast.  The first night my card was picked up before I had a chance to fill it out and I never got a new card so I never got the breakfast.  I was later informed I could have called down to have them bring me a card but it was too late by then.  This was a minor issue though and did not change my opinion of the hotel.  All in all, it's a great boutique hotel in the heart of New Orleans.  I would gladly stay here again.PS:  Though I read the hotel was haunted I did not experience anything out of the ordinary with the exception of one night I heard what sounded like people running up and down the hall outside my door.  When I got up to look, no one was there.",1,0.5023994523994525
626613362,"After struggling with our luggage at the front door (2 sets of doors, stairs with no ramp and no assistance) we arrived at this hotel at approximately 3:40pm to promptly be told that check in time is 4pm.  Not a great start. After checking in they said they would check with housekeeping regarding our room.  We were told that we had been &quot;upgraded to a larger suite&quot;.  With again, no assistance or offer to show us the room we went in search of it.  As it turned out our &quot;upgrade&quot; was at the furthest corner of the hotel and the walk there was ridiculous.  The room was less than impressive as we had requested one large terrace room and now we had 2 chopped up smaller rooms with way too much furniture in the living area.  The door to our room constantly stuck forcing my husband to literally hip check it to get in each time.  The ice machine on our floor didn't work and because of their &quot;security&quot; system (you can only access the floor your room is on) my husband had to take the ridiculous walk to the lobby to retrieve ice there.  In addition the bar in the main lobby was not welcoming at all and the one time we stopped there it took 20 minutes to get a glass of orange juice because they couldn't find any.  The location itself is great and perhaps we just had a bad experience however it wasn't just one thing that went wrong and I'm sure not up to the standards of most Relais &amp; Chateaux properties.",0,0.6343033509700177

Luca communicated with me constantly by email and I told him ahead of time about my arrival. It's a very short walk, but because I was alone, and it was late at night, I took a cab. I think it wound up costing me about 10Euros.I hopped out of the cab, and the BB is really nondescript. I didn't even notice it. But! Out came Luca who then gave me a quick tour, my keys, then showed me right up to my room.They give you a key for the gate, and for the main door, so it felt really secure in there. There is an area to relax outside, and a living area inside.My room was big, clean, and had a TV. The bed was comfortable, and the room was quiet. The bathroom was adjacent to my room, and that was also very clean. The kitchen is self service and was stocked with pastries, milk, water, cereals, bread, jam, meats, cheeses and yogurts. I may be missing some things, but it had the essentials.The next morning, I left my bag behind the desk where the &quot;reception&quot; area is and took a walk down to see the sites. It was about a 20 minute walk to the Leaning Tower, and theres a lot to see along the way.I took the train from Pisa to Rome, and the walk was about 15 minutes at a slow pace with my backpack on. It was really easy to find. The neighborhood felt safe, and well taken care of.Over all lucky house was wonderful! They were helpful and accommodating.

The room was very clean upon arrival and a plus was that they have an over sized tub.  The hotel is also where Crystal Mall is so parking was a little hard during certain times, but we still managed to always find something.  The Opal Lounge is also another plus, they offer a continental breakfast of fluffy eggs, crispy potatoes, delicious pastries, and a fast coffee/latte maker.

218661860,"We are pretty frequent clients here, perhaps 8 stays in past 8 years. This is our come-and-relax place for us in Quebec - convenient to everything from the action on the hill near the Ch. Frontenac to access to the Bas Ville (lower city and port), Market, Place de la Gare, and the neat district of St. Roch, all within 10 minutes walk. Like all Quebec hotels, this place is busy in summer, but in our recent stay, perhaps our first in high season, we heard nobody else in the hotel, yet at breakfast we saw everyone. You cannot beat the price for this class of hotel - clean spotless, interesting rooms, especially the suites and the new building, lots of character. Staff are great and go out of their way to make us feel at home, make reservations and recommendations for new restaurants, a bottle of wine in our room for an anniversary, etc. Breakfast is very good, best croissants in the city, and out of season some of the suites have the option of breakfast in the room. Suites have micro-wave and nespresso machines and fridges, fireplaces and logs are provided, so it is really easy to relax and just enjoy. Toast downstairs is the evening restaurant and even though they use the courtyard during the summer as an extension of the seating, the sound is deadened by the trees and the covering, and with windows open above it all, you cannot hear it, but I would avoid ground floor or first floor courtyard rooms in summer if you expect dead quiet evenings. (as I said we usually go off season). HINT - there are tons of nice restaurants in the surrounding area for lunch and dinner - our preference is for elegant lunches - similar food at lower prices - Laurie Raphael, Panache, Echaude, L'Egende, Il Matto. Pick up fruit, veg, cheese and hams in the market for afternoon snacks or dinner replacement (don't forget local cidres). HINT 2 - if you require a lounge or bar or just a little more social room, the very much pricier Auberge St. Antoine is 50 steps away down the street and the ground floor lounge bar is wonderful for meeting friends or relaxing with a drink or a board game - and also exploring the history of where you are staying as it is all one big archaeological excavation and it is all displayed in the ground floor.",1,0.4507174307174307

The room was a little smaller than I expected but was plenty spacious for the night and we slept very well. The hotel is very contemporary: lots of dim lights and dark furnishings.

The staff were very friendly and helpful and they have a locked left luggage room too which means you can safely leave your bags there before or after check out. It's easy to find from the nearest bus stop too and they kindly sent us helpful directions when we booked. Free WiFi was a plus also. The bed was comfortable enough and for 60 euros for one night with a room with a private bathroom it represents good value for a brief stay near the main sites of Pisa.

My room is in the ballroom, right above the wedding space. I could not hear a thing this past Saturday night with the party going on below me.

There are not that many servers, so they may take a while to get back to you. The servers are all very friendly and helpful.I also ate in the Silver Creek dining room several times, super yummy food.I am so happy that I chose to stay here over a nearby Marriott, this was a luxury hotel experience for a good rate that included breakfast.

We wanted quieter but still convenient to what we wanted to do (basically museums and day trips out of the city).  I am so pleased with our stay at the Hotel Wilshire, I can't wait to go back.  And we've only been home 3 days!The booking experience online was great, easy and quick.  Found a very reasonable (for LA) AAA rate.  A week before we departed, the Concierge wrote and asked if we had any photos of children or pets we'd like waiting for us bedside when we got there.  I emailed her two photos and there they were framed on the bedside tables for us.  On arrival, Cesar was very friendly and welcoming and he graciously agreed to print out Getty villa tickets for us from my email.Our room had two queen beds and a large bathroom.  Everything was clean and comfortable.  It was more than enough room for us for a week together.  There was next to no street noise overnight (Wilshire gets really quiet outside the business day) and I heard no guests above, below or outside our room the entire time we were there.  My only complaint was the air conditioning, which was in the ceiling directly over my bed and seemed to blow directly on me the entire night.  Slowing the fan or decreasing the temp (to the detriment of others in the room) didn't seem to help much.  We pushed the shutters on the unit closed but they'd inevitably reopen eventually.Breakfast was an additional cost, but we had it most days just because it was convenient and we loved the view on the roof.  Even before 9 a.m. it can still get quite warm in the sun up there, so bring sunglasses, wear sunscreen and get there early if you want one of the couple shady spots.  Breakfast was delicious and substantial.  We had yogurt/granola and a bagel most days but also loved the orange brandy French toast.Parking is steep here, but we got around it by using the covered lot next door for $12 a day.  Kimpton members get a $10 credit towards the mini-bar but water is $8 a bottle.  Out the door to the left a block down is a 99 cent store where you can get a 6 pack of water for 59 cents and more...  Across the street in the Chase building is a small deli (open business hours only) and behind that a lobby shop also selling water and snacks.  Closest ATMs are across the street in Chase or out the door to the left for Wells Fargo.This location ended up working quite well for us in terms of getting around.

But i am afraid the pictures online are just there for advert. Please do not get fooled like we were. I did not even look to see if this hotel had tea or coffee in the room, that is usually there in a 3/4 hotel. My Mistake. No tea or coffee in the room. What made it worse the hotel restaurant was a different business, so nothing was added to your bill. You had to pay that separate. Room service was $8, each time. Also rooms were only made up before 12 midday, so if you had a lay in and went out after 12 the room never got made up.  It offered a Limo service into town,train station or airport. So we went for this service when we checked out. There was no limo just a large grey car. The air conditioning did not work, we spoke to them about that and they said it was not switched on until we had been down and asked on out second day. But even then it did not work.

608056258,We had to stay at a hotel while my dad was in hospital.  We really needed a dog friendly hotel that was comfortable with two kids and a small dog.  The Handlery puts dog rooms in the very back of the property which is understandable.  There is a small patch of grass in the back parking lot for dogs to do their business.  The major thing that was hard for us was the room had two full sized beds.  The rooms are tiny so that is all they could fit in the rooms I guess.  It was so hard to sleep in a full sized bed when you're used to a Queen or King.  If you can sleep that close to someone then you should be fine but it was not easy to sleep and we are not big people.  My two kids even had a hard time not kicking each other in the face while they slept.  The bathrooms have no counter space which is annoying when you need to set up your stuff.  The pool area was nice and the restaurants and service was good.  They have a nice small gym that is clean.  They also have a nice Happy Hour.  Would we stay here again?  Maybe... but  only if we have our dog with us again.,1,0.5654761904761905

His attitude was a shame because he let down the rest of his team who were great. I gave 5* for location solely based on its proximity to the beach.

Shane, Alan, and Deb are the UTLIMATE hosts, and Serenity Ranch is beautiful, elegant, comfortable, welcoming, convenient, and very affordable.Our group of nine travelled to Hamilton in late December for a New Yearâs Eve wedding. We all stayed at Serenity Ranch for 6 nights. With all the âcoming and goingâ associated with a large group and a big event, our schedule was quite hectic, but the staff was incredibly accommodating! Breakfast was served at our convenience, and the other reviewers are not kidding about the croissantsâ¦they are THE BEST!! Homemade soups, hot, hearty, and delicious, were available anytime someone was hungry along with numerous snacks and beverages. Favorite beverage: Serenity Ranch red!!On our second evening at the Ranch, we hosted a party there for the bride and groom with about 20 guests. Shane provided an outstanding array of hot and cold hor d'oeuvres along with excellent wines and specialty beers. Late flights and bad weather made everyone late, but, true-to-form, the staff graciously served until everyone had time to enjoy the food and companyâ¦way above and beyond the call of duty!Our rooms were incredibly comfortable, had every amenity one could imagine, and were very quiet. Each room had an electric fireplace, a tv, a refrigerator, a coffee maker, and a microwave. Baths included hairdryers, toothbrushes, shampoos, conditioners, etc. The dining and living areas were spacious and cozy including the very inviting âSunset Cottageââa âback porchâ with a freestanding gas stove and a gas fire pitâenclosed in the winter and open in the summer. There is even a guest kitchen on the lower level of the house if youâd like to prepare your own mealsâ¦but you wonât need it because Shane is a gourmet chef, too!The location is easy and convenient to Hamiltonâjust far enough from the city to give you the country feeling but only minutes to anywhere. Rather than using the Toronto airport, we flew from New Orleans to Buffalo, NY and rented a vehicle. The drive to the Ranch was easy and fastâless than 90 miles.I could go on and on about how special Serenity Ranch is, but Iâve run out of adjectivesâ¦.just go!!

There is a small but nice workout facility with machines in good working order.  Note: 85% of the businesses, restaurants, etc. surrounding this hotel are Chinese, which we enjoyed - it was somewhat like being in China.  However, once we had our fill of Chinese food, we found Earls which is just two blocks away with great food and a nice patio. The Burnaby Public Library is right across the street along with a beautiful park - in the morning, there were people practicing Tai Chi and also some type of flowing movements with the use of beautiful, colorful fans opening and closing as they moved.

For $4 I had all our holiday clothes washed and dried. I did buy my washing powder from the supermarket across the road however as it was much cheaper than the hotel shop.We had a front room which meant facing the I8 road.

After booking our ocean view room I came across a few mixed reviews and called the hotel to ask about them. Jennifer was great. She took the time to go over my questions and made sure we had everything we needed. Here is what I learned before our visit. The inn is in the process of renovating the rooms with a great portion of them already completed. New mattresses are part of the renovations (and we found out they are so comfortable) They do have two legged guest rooms only. The staff (from personal experience) makes you feel like you came to stay with family that you actually like. We pulled up to the Inn and liked it right away. The beach relaxation feel starts right from the parking lot. The bohemian theme they advertise is PERFECT. Even though they are working on the rooms you don't see any outward signs to give you that &quot;under construction&quot; feel. You immediately start to relax, the heated pool looked clean, well kept and inviting and when we got to our room we could not understand any negative reviews. If this is due to the renovations or just great service I don't know but good job! The rooms were very clean, love the full size fridge, the decor was just right and everything worked great. We were upstairs and the view from our well sized balcony was great. No smell of pets and even though we expected to hear barking that night . . . not a peep.

The location was perfect.  Only a short walk from the train station, about 5-10 minutes.  This was great since we based ourselves here for visiting Siena, Cinque Terre and Lucca.  Also convenient to the airport, just 5 minutes by train (where we picked up our car for Tuscany).   It was about a 20-30 min walk to the leaning tower and baptismal, etc.  But a very easy walk thru a shopping area, with mostly foot traffic. We found the staff to be friendly and helpful.The price was really reasonable.  As far as elegance, we got the most for our money here.  The rooms were beautiful!  There is a safe in the room which is always nice!  There is public internet for a small price in the lobby.  You get your access code from the front desk.  It's good for 24 hours if you don't use all the minutes.The breakfast was one of our best.  The chocolate croissants were so incredible we still long for them each morning, but get there early.  From what we could tell they only make a small amount (unless more came out as the morning went on, we usually started first thing in the morning).For dinner out:From the station to the hotel, there was a great pizza place on the right (with US license plates on the wall).  We ate there twice, once in and one take away.  Along that same strip on the right (if I it should be right before or after the pizza place) was a restaurant I think called Anna Marie's.  The price was unbeatable.  The food fantastic!!!   (Also a Rick Steve's recommendation)",1,0.6066326530612243
178160106,"Me and my brother just stayed in the Hotel Di Stefano. The Location is perfect! We were a 5 minute walk away from the square of miracles where the leaning tower is :) and the 'Pisa Centrale' train station was close too (15 min walk away). Which was handy for our daytrip to Florence (which I would recommend). The staff were helpful and very nice - giving us adive on how to catch a bus for a daytrip to the beach. The continental breakfast wasn't the full English I'm used to when I'm on holiday, but there were cooked croissants each morning, a choice of cereals, cold yoghurts, English tea, juice, toast, bread rolls, cheese, ham...Not many guests took advantage of the roof terrace which meant me and my brother could go hang out on the terrace looking over at the leaning tower of Pisa while drinking a beer on a night, and have it totally to ourselves! Awesome :) The only issue we had was struggling to connect to the wi-fi when trying to keep in touch with our family and friends - but some local cafe's had free wi-fi so we just used theirs to keep in touch.Overall I'd highly reccommend this hotel and would happily stay there in future :D",1,0.6928947368421052

The art was awesome...the Burt Reynolds painting still continues to make me laugh. Be sure to check out the artwork of Phoenix made out of recycled security envelopes and checks...so cool! The room had an industrial-style and were uber-clean. Beds were comfy. Located right next to the lightrail it is an easy ride to the center of downtown Phoenix.

The Hop-ON Hop-Off Vancouver Sightseeing Trolley stops right outside as does the airport shuttle. There is a Starbucks opposite and great Lebanese down the street at the Bombay Cafe.I had been booked into the Holiday Inn as part of a Rocky Mointaineer package, at the &quot;budget&quot; level. It was certainly  more than adequate for this standard. My room was large and well equipped., extremely clean and the beds are very comfortable. The bathroom was adequate although small. In the reception area, there is a small shop which sells souvenirs, and on the second floor there are several payphones (use cash, credit card or buy phone cards from reception-great value!) I didn't investigate any other facilities in my short stay.The reception staff are friendly and the woman at the information desk was especially helpful. She had a good knowledge of the city and even kept helping as we walked along the street on her way home! The staff in the dining room were good - especially Betty!

The cooked breakfast was served on cold plates and the food was tepid to cold.

310242445,"We went there as a family and kept Pisa as our base to explore Pisa and Florence. Hotels and Airfare were expensive if Florence is considered as base. Pisa to Florence is only 1 hour by train and there are lot of trains between the two stations. We choose an apartment for four of us and there were no complaints with respect to the facilities. Fully functional Kitchen , very good bath fittings and comfortable beds were the highlights. One sofa cum bed in the living room and a separate bed room were available. The flipside to this apartment is that it had only 1 aircon in the living room which was not sufficient to cool both the living room and the bed room (despite the bedroom door kept open). Another disadvantage is that it was 15 minutes away from the Pisa train station. Though you have bus connections very near to this apartment to take you to the train station, you should add this travel time to your schedules. The day we arrived , there was a Bus strike and we were left with no option to travel since you cannot find taxis near this place. Our saving grace was in the form of the owner of this apartment - Massimo . When I informed him that there was a Bus strike, he took his own vehicle to transport me to the train station. Massimo is such a nice person that he goes to any length to serve you.",1,0.7031250000000001

I wondered about aircraft noise - but heard nothing and slept soundly.  I could hear the aircon in the room but it didn't disturb. The bedrooms were spotless and the bed really comfortable.  I found the lights a bit dim but maybe I have to sacrifice functionality for style.  I could read easily using the overhead bedside light. Reception staff, in particular, were very warm and extremely helpful.  We appreciated the clear instructions and advice regarding the local bus service (the bus stop is only five or so minutes away).  Whilst located near the airport and not centrally, it was an easy short bus trip into Pisa and back, with frequent buses.We never tried the restaurant except for breakfast.  The breakfast was not super fancy but just fine.   Although quite busy, the breakfast area never felt crowded or rushed.

11694645,"My wife and I stayed here for one night in December 2007.  We booked the hotel through Expedia, and paid about $120 for the night.The hotel is near to the airport, and takes about 10 minutes by taxi.  This costs about  10-12 euros (depending on traffic).The hotel has an interesting design theme and looks quite funky, with the lights outside changing every 30 seconds. The inside is equally interesting, with a minimalist theme. My wife and I really liked it.The young lady at the front-desk was superb.  Always polite and helpful, and made us feel very welcome.  She gave us information on how to get to town, assisted with buying bus tickets, allowed us to leave our bags there for the day after checking out (as our flight was at night), and booked the shuttle for us to get back to the airport.We got a room on the ground floor.  The hallway has some interesting decorations, and felt clean and modern.  The room itself was nice, with a decent amount of space, lots of mirrors and the same modern design as the rest of the hotel.The room was quite big and had plenty of lighting.  There was an LCD TV mounted into the mirror which was nice, and has various channels, though the only one in English was CNN.The bathroom is a nice size, and has the usual amenities.  The shower had a small leak in the pipe, but worked really well and didn't cause any problems - though a sign says you shouldn't use it between 3am-4am due to risk of thermic shock (!)The city centre isn't too far from the hotel, and takes about 15 minutes on the bus, with the bus stop a few minutes walk away.  In the daytime, buses 13, 14 and Lam Blue can be used, and at night, bus number 22.You can buy tickets from the hotel for 90 cents, and also at the machine, though the machine at the bus stop near the hotel appeared to be broken, so you may want to buy them from the hotel before leaving.The leaning tower and other historic sites are about a 15-20 minute walk from the last bus stop, through the market where there are lots of shops and stalls.

It had a safe, VERY reasonably priced mini-bar, complimentary toiletries and tea/ coffee making facilities. The wi-fi, which I needed for work, gave a speedy connection and I did not need to keep logging in, as is so often the case.  The hotelâs location is good; a couple of minutes away from a main shopping street and a pleasant stroll of 20 minutes to the Tower. The breakfast was the usual buffet with fresh Italian coffee made to order. Guests can use the orange juice machine for a delicious glass of freshly squeezed juice. There was a free sampling of Tuscan treats every evening. The staff spoke impeccable English and were helpful and friendly. I am glad I changed hotels. I nearly ranked this as &quot;excellent&quot; as in many respects it is.  However, it lacked some luxurious touches such as fluffy towels and the air con was not yet switched on, so that when I felt hot I had to open my window onto a noisy street.

We asked if there was anywhere else to have a drink and were shown to a small bland room just off reception and told we could have drinks brought in there.  Never mind there was a whole town outside the door.  The room we were allocated was quite small on the 5th floor but it was clean and tidy and the bed comfortable. There was no internet connection however as the hotel advertise, although we asked at least 4 times, nothing was done.  The towles were smelly and I had to ask the housekeeper for clean ones.

Service was so poor. There was only a few waiters and waitresses to serve 245 guests. Bread was served cold and hard, Salad was spread out on the plate to look like there was a lot. Portions of the food was small. Coffee was not served.

I cannot say enough good things about this hotel  The staff is friendly and helpful, and you really feel that they value you as a guest.  From the moment we checked in until the moment we checked out, the staff was attentive and welcoming.  On several occasions when we ate in the restaurant, the restaurant manager stopped by our table to ask if there were any problems with our meal.  The wait staff, whether in the restaurant or the lounge, were prompt and friendly.  Although a little inconvenient if you are not planning to rent a vehicle, the hotel's free shuttle service is available to take you to major locations, and we did not feel terribly inconvenienced by the location.  On the few occasions when we relied on taxi service rather than the shuttle, cab fares were relatively low (under $20) and it was a non-issue.  The hotel was clean and quiet.  Our room was on the second floor and we had a high loft ceiling in the room.  Free wifi is offered, and the service was reliable.  The meals offered in the restaurant were great and reasonably priced (good selection under $20 for supper, breakfast under $10).  Special thanks to Jeff and to Lindel, who went above and beyond to make our stay at the Handlery enjoyable.

It is both formal in nature, but casual in what they encourage for the guests (wear your bathrobe to meals in the dining room).  We had a suite in the main house area which was plenty spacious for 3. The meals are very good - perfect portion sizes, but after multiple courses you are beyond full.  I generally don't eat dessert and I couldn't resist given how good it was.

When we arrived, it was after midnight and the first room we were allocated on the 5th floor was very unappealing - stank of smoke and was very dated.  As we were using the hotel as a base for 5 nights, we asked to be moved and the room on the 3rd floor was worlds apart - very clean, modern and most importantly, no smell of stale cigarettes.  Breakfast was standard. The room had a safe, a fridge and very crisp clean bed linen / towels and basic toiletries were provided. The only real improvements needed are 1) long life milk in the room to make coffee / tea and 2) reception staff to acknowledge you - although we attempted to make eye contact and greet them each morning etc, only one lady made any acknowledgement in return. In general, staff turned away unless checking in a guest and this was noted by others in their reviews. Did it impact our stay? Not really, but it did create a bizarre atmosphere where we didn't like to approach the staff for advice on trains, restaurants etc which we would normally do to seek local recommendations.",1,0.5388461538461539

We knew not to look in the Sainte-Foy area as this was too far from the main site; we looked for those closest to the old quarters.  Based on what was shown on their site, we reserved with them.  A very, very good choice!!  We were 3 couples and two of them opted to be in the same room with 2 beds.  All the couples agreed this was a wonderful setting. The rooms were large enough and very clean.  This is an older building, but it was obvious the whole had been gutted out and everything about it is new, modern and upscale.The service staff are very pleasant, very accommodating, and did everything to make our stay as enjoyable as possible.  We all decided to eat at the hotel restaurant (Il Matto) and this, too, was a good decision.  Italian menu that was very well presented and enjoyable - all 3 couples complimented their respective choices.

He got us checked in quickly and gave us a lot of tips on places to visit and eat while visiting! AMAZING! The rooms have typical Hotel Furniture, but we were not expecting anything fancy for the price that we paid. We had booked a two bedroom Suite, that had double beds in one room, and a King in the other, in addition to the sofa bed in the livingroom. It also had a full kitchen.The beds were comfortable. The room was very clean.The pool and Hot tub were also an added bonus after a long day of sightseeing and walking at the San Diego Zoo!The breakfast in the mornings was one of the best ones we have ever enjoyed at a hotel.

The hotel is 300 metres from the beach and has it's own private area on the beach, has an Olympic sized swimming pool and a small gym. The hotel has 175 bedrooms and we booked a &quot;comfort room&quot; which had it's own balcony looking out over the public car park and down the beach to Livorno, a few miles away. The room was reasonably sized with TV and fridge, good cupboard and draw space, clean, neat and tidy, the only drawback was the wall mounted lighting which made the room rather dark. Bathroom with shower and bidet, towels changed every 3 days. The hotel's  public areas are light, spacious and airy, although only a small bar to serve guests after dinner. The breakfasts are continental lots of fruit and pastries with only scrambled egg with sausage or bacon as a hot option. The evening meals consist of a cold buffet ( plenty choice) followed by soup or pasta, then main course and sweet or cheese. The dishes are Italian cooking and so not to everyones taste but the waiters changed dishes without question if needed. Most of the staff speak English and are polite and friendly with advice and assistance when needed.

Not the kind of atmosphere I look for in a &quot;4.5&quot; star hotel.Room keys (swipe cards) were unreliable - we had to make two separate trips for both our cards.Parking, as with most hotel parking, is a rip off - $29 + 12% tax for self park, $35 + tax for valet.Note on top of the 12% GST, Whistler charges as 2% resort fees so get ready to pay 14% in tax.  Can't complain about the last minute (meaning night before) hotel deal though: I called at noon on Friday and was quoted $219.  Later that evening, I did the last minute unknown hotel thing and secured a $179 rate for the same hotel.Whistler Village itself never disappoints (except the shopping but I'm not there for that).  HIking in the alpine is always wonderful.  When buying gondola tickets we were asked if we wanted to pay an additional $15 for the mtn top bbq.  We said no (we had dinner reservations elsewhere) but next time I'd say YES - it looked like a tremendous and delicious value in a lovely setting.</span><span class=""taLnk ulBlueLinks moreBtn"" onclick=""widgetEvCall('handlers.clickExpand', event, this);"">More</span>",1,0.5212797619047619

Going to the pool for a drink and a bit to eat requires carry about 100 euros cash.To get a pool towel you have to ask at the front desk, this should be given to you on checkin. But we did not get any towels. On the second day we asked for our towels and where told you only get one pool towel per stay,. We explained we had not been given a towel. Rather than the hotel saying sorry and giving us a towel they first had to check with house keeping if we had been given a towel. When house keeping confirmed we had not had  towel we where given one. I asked if we where staying for 5 days would we only get one pool towel and was told yes.We stayed for 2 nights, after visiting pisa in the morning we came back for a swim and then lunch, As are room had not been made up I asked at the front desk if are room could be made up as we wanted to rest after lunch. After one hour I checked the room and it still had not been made, I went back to the front desk to complain. This is what I was told &quot;We have over 100 rooms and we will get your room ready when we are ready&quot;  I was not happy with this answer and asked to speak to the manager and was told there is NO Manager in this hotel.So be aware not to stay more then one night take your own pool towel and don't ask for a Manager as the hotel has no management,The other thing about this hotel is all over the place they show letter from Trip advisor say how good they are, When I said I would write a bad review i was told please do.",0,0.6042361111111111

The breakfast each morning was fantastic. Telling Shane that I was up super early for the marathon was no problem, as he prepared a special breakfast the night before and put it in my fridge (oh yeah - fridge, microwave, full bathroom in room). The bed was very comfortable, but the thing that stands out is the customer service. Shane and Alan were incredibly warm and gracious the entire time, giving my fiancÃ© and I extra tea and wine throughout the day. The sitting room in the back is great, and the whole house is very relaxing and quiet. All of the interior decorations and finishes are high end and very appealing, all designed and conceived by Shane! I wish it was a warmer weekend to enjoy more of the outdoor space, as there is a huge front/back porch and sitting area. As a runner, having a guest kitchen in the basement was a huge draw. Making my own pasta the night before and controlling my nutrition was important. The kitchen is well stocked and very nice. Next time I am in the area, I will definitely be staying here again.

They are taking advantage of tourism.  Rooms were clean, but no frills - same with the bathroom.  The people at the front desk were not knowledgable, and were slow.  The Hotel is out dated and they had to run my CC by hand swipe.  Our flight was very early in the morning, but the front desk was not 24hr - they only work for about a 7 hour window - so we had to have our agent check us out after we left.  I tried to call the 'on call' number they gave me, but apparently I was not more important than sleep for the person on the other side.  I was told to wait until they opened later - not an option for us.The restaurant did not include breakfast and was way over-priced - meals running upwards of CAD 50 (US$45) - so we did not eat there.I would recommend the Frobisher Bay Hotel on the hill top - if you must go to this town.

69358154,"We stayed at the Town &amp; Country for 6 days to attend a YMCA Gymnastics Tournament.  Because the tournament was held on the T&amp;C grounds, it was very convenient.The RoomThe room was just fine.  As many have mentioned before, the room and grounds were very clean and tidy, and yes, a bit outdated.  We had a standard room (2 queen beds) and it was roomy with a private balcony overlooking the pool area.  Other families had a smaller room, so it may be just a matter of luck.   And yes, we did have the weird picture of a young girl staring at us while we were in bed.  My kids were freaked out, but it didn't bother me at all.  The only complaints I have is that the showerhead is about 4 feet off the ground, so I had to bend over to get my head wet.  Also the bathroom door is a sliding door and has no lock.  My kids thinks it's fun to walk in on daddy during his &quot;private&quot; time.The FacilitiesThe restaurants are great, but are way overpriced -- actually expensive.  The deli sells Starbucks coffee at about double the normal price.  The kids spent a lot of time in the pool, especially at night because it was heated.  Bathrooms on the grounds and in the different buildings were hard to find and when found, they were very small (1 or 2 stalls) -- causing lines.  A nice mall is located just behind the hotel with a walkway connecting the two.  It was a great place to eat (decent food court) or to kill a few hours here and there.The AmenitiesTown &amp; Country does charge you for everything.  The rooms have no mini-fridge ($10 extra per day if you want one) which for an extended stay, causes a huge inconvenience.  Internet access is another $10 per day.  Fortunately, Town &amp; Country uses AT&amp;T for its internet service.  So since I have an AT&amp;T DSL account, I was able to access the internet for free.  Internet service however was spotty and slow and there were times when I could not even connect.  Parking was another $8 per day for hotel guests, but since I was with the YMCA group, I got a discount to $3 per day.  Still, I'd rather pay zero.The convention area (where the gymnastics events were held) was nice.  It was very spacious and clean.  My only complaint about this area is that we were not allowed to bring food or drink into the area.  The events were about 4-5 hours long and being able to snack on something would have been nice.Much to my surprise, there are no guest laundry facilities on site (just a dry cleaning service).  The desk told us to go to the Best Western down the street to use their laundry.  Instead, we googled for a local laundromat and went there since that would allow us to use multiple machines at once.Overall, my experience was good.  With the YMCA group discount we paid about the same as we would have paid at the Holiday Inn.  So all-in-all not bad.",1,0.5157298474945533

The lobby, reception area and hall ways are nice, spacious and well decorated but the room we stayed in (room 308) was quite simply the worst hotel room I have ever stayed in. I got just 3 hours sleep because of the noise outside our room but this wasn't the only issue with this overpriced hotel. The furniture looked like it had not been updated for 20 odd years, the 12 inch TV did not work properly (only four channels had any reception), the hot water took an age to come on, the shower curtain was not fit for purpose, the window shutters did not close (this might have helped keep some of the noise out), the floor tiles were falling to pieces and the walls desperately needed a lick of paint. On the plus side, the breakfast was good and the staff are ok - we asked to be moved and they did try to accommodate this but couldn't. All in all, a very disappointing experience and our room was not even close to being 3* standard.

A fascinating story to be sure.  We were impressed with everything.  The decor and construction was handled with guests in mind and showed a real love for the business.  After we settled in, Shane offered us both a glass of wine which we accepted and he gave us more information on the property, his goals, and all of his challenges along the way.  In addition to being situated in a beautiful area, the time Shane spent decorating the home left nothing out with total focus on customer service.  Our room was elegantly done with everything one would want or need.  The bed was very comfortable and Shane continued to extend himself if there was something missing.

157665636,"This hotel had generally good but some mixed reviews; negatives focused largely on breakfast servings and the small room size. I think the negative ones are likely from visitors who are not used to typical European hotels, as I found the hotel to be clean, and comfortable, and extremely pleasant. The staff were terrific - friendly, helpful, and very much made me feel at home. The staff had great recommendations for dinner, served a lovely Italian style breakfast with delicious home-baked coissants and rolls and typically wonderful espresso (yes, no eggs to order, but what self-respecting Italian Inn does?), and were very helpful with maps and drawn-out routes to get me through town. The hotel itself was very clean - my #1 priority - and the room was typical for a European Inn - small but comfortable, with plenty of room to walk around (unlike some other hotels), plenty of outlets, and a separate bathroom. I could see how some folks might say it is far from the main attractions of Pisa - it is about as far south as you can get outside of the airport - but Pisa is quite small, and if you are reasonably fit it is still only 20-30 minutes from the northern-most part of town where the Tower and the Duomo can be found; it was actually quite a lovely walk, and you get to see what Pisa is like (I was here on a Saturday, and got to go past lots of open markets for food, gifts, art, antiques, etc.). Thus, unless you have difficulty walking, it is actually nicer being away from the main drag.  A couple of minor negatives that the owners can address: my shower did not have hot water (lukewarm but not hot), a larger bar of soap or more generous body gel for use in the shower would have been nice, and it was noisy - I liked to have the windows open, and there was a dog barking incessantly (not the fault of the hoteliers, though).

6798859,"Okay, let me begin by saying, that I was prepared for what I got...  Tripadvisor reviews gave me a nice well rounded picture of what to expect with this hotel.  I was staying only for one night and psyched myself up for what might be.  The only good things - the room has Sky TV - many, many channels to distract you from the very depressing room, and of course the fantastic location!  1 minute from Pisa's main attractions.  The negatives - first of all, I couldn't date the place, I just knew it was old, and seriously in need of a reno.  Later when I was at the bar, trying to numb myself before having to trek up to my very lonely, sad, single room, I asked the bartender, and he indicated the hotel is two years away from their 50th anniversary.  The hotel isn't retro cool , it isn't  even shabby chic, just depressingly dim.  The bar and dining rooms have a sort of naf allure, but heading upstairs to the darkly lit, dank hallways, only to enter an even worse room made it a challenge.  It tried to be as clean as possible, however, seeing discarded packaging from the previous guest which hadn't been removed and the odd stray hair in the tub or sink, kind of makes your stomach turn.  The windows couldn't open, the bedspread so horrible I had to physically remove the thing, and absolutely ZERO hot water dribbled from the very poor shower head.  My pictures attached unfortunately do not fully reveal the ugliness of the room - just take my word on it.  My advice is the following:  do research and find something better!  Pisa is quite small, even if you aren't right opposite the tower, you won't ever be that far.

The room was very clean nice. The rooms have a full refrigerator, sink, microwave, dishwasher, coffee machine. The bathroom is simple, my room had a standing shower with a glass door.

The G.H Inn is 1 &amp; 1/2 blocks off of the &quot;N&quot; Judah tram line, and is a very easy walk, to access anything in the city.  I took the walk both evenings after sunset and felt at ease due to lighting and the numbers of other people useing the same walkng areas.With exception to early evening traffic the Hotel is in a very quiet area.  Quiet is something unheard of in downtown SF.   Parking is free at G.H.Inn.  There is a free shuttle to UCSF Medical Center.  There is an on site restaurant.The room amenities are not what those demanding special treatment, or being treated like king will expect, but the are what you need.

Ice is available in the office.The room was clean, quiet and comfortable.  I heard NO noise from adjoining rooms and had two very good nights of sleep.

We had called ahead to ask about a possible room upgrade for our stay and we were told that could be done (it had been put on our file).  Upon arrival we found out that 90% of the hotel was occupied by young soccer players and that a room upgrade was not possible as there were no available rooms for that. The hotel was quiet though and the large group of young people were not an issue, which was a pleasant surprise.The room that we did receive was clean but we needed to call down for towels one day and did not receive fresh soaps and shampoo and by the end of the stay needed to call for more.  Pool towels were missing more than once.The breakfast in the club lounge was really nice and the woman who ran the facility did an excellent job of handling all the people, dishes and stocking of food items.

The restaurant on site is divine--one of the best in QC--so make reservations early! The concierge serve like none other. We called to book the restaurant on Christmas eve but reserved too late, so they booked us for the first night, and proceeded to call 8 other restaurants in the area and make reservations for us for 6 people for both Christmas eve and christmas day!! They always had excellent suggestions for where to eat and what to do. It's in a perfect location in the lower town, but keep in mind that it is about a 20 minute hike to upper town which is fine if you are spry but something to keep in mind if traveling with those who may not be as mobile...if so, I might recommend staying closer to the action in upper town. If not: STAY HERE! Each room is magnificent and unique as it used to be an old fishing wharf and cannonery, and the old brick is incorporated into the hallways and rooms. They even offer tours of the site as it is also a museum! Our room was enormous with a luxurious bathroom with tub/shower/techy toilet lol.

Check in was really smooth and I will give a special shout out to Felix who checked me in and was absolutely lovely, friendly and helpful. I immediately felt welcomed!My room was on the 3rd floor and sort of buried a little. But it was a lovely clean and warm room. Small, but it was all I needed. The bed was so comfy! Actually, all the beds in all of the Fairmont Hotels I have recently stayed in have been super comfy. The location is obviously brilliant - you go out the door and you are right in the middle off it all. The St Lawrence River is below and stairs or a funicular to go to the Lower town with its quirky shops and lovely restaurants. As well you are directly opposite the tourist information centre and the area where many day tours leave. I felt safe, comfortable and welcome in this hotel. The concierge service was great and very helpful in giving me tips and helping me with various things (even trying to get me into the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth - but it was unfortunately all booked out). I ordered room service a few times and while expensive was yummy and worth it. The housekeepers are also lovely and do such a great job.

We did not go there after the first morning.  Two servers, no bus person and what appeared to be one cook; the dining room is small, you wait to get in and then the wait to order and for food leads to a 45 minute or more breakfast.

443309831,"Stayed at Dolce Hayes for about 4 days while I attended a meeting at the hotel. The place is absolutely gorgeous but the room furnishings (curtains, desks, light fixtures were so old. The curtains especially were faded and just downright ugly lending the room a strange vibe. There were also no mirrors whatsoever in the hallways or by the elevators which I found odd...lots of hotels include a mirror on the way out of your room. Beyond that, the hotel always managed to either delay or mess up my in-room dining reservations. I was always on hold for at least several minutes and the front staff took the order but never knew what was on the menu (soup of the day? no idea?) and then it took them forever to call the kitchen and then call me back. The food itself was ok...nothing to write home about. But trays never got picked up from beside the room door until the following day when housekeeping came around. I don't understand why in-room dining was so poor because the food at the event I was attending was delicious. I do want to commend the hotel on the friendliness and helpfulness of some of their staff- actually, they genuinely cared. When I checked in, I had my 2 year old son with me as well as a member of my family and it was late at night. I was beyond exhausted and the bellman was gone for the day. So a gentleman from security helped me with the luggage and parked the car for me, then brought me the keys. He also asked me if we wanted anything to drink. It was just such a relief to be greeted by someone so thoughtful and kind after a very long trip and with a young child. I am very sorry that I didn't ask his name but he was gracious, professional, and truly kind. It made all the difference.Also, I wish to thank the housekeeping staff while I was there. Again, forgot to ask for their names, but I was deeply moved by their thoughtfulness, their kindness and warmth towards my son...they would laugh with him and ask him questions. They also asked us repeatedly if we needed anything and though the rooms were equipped with small keurig machines for coffee, there was no cream, sugar, or stirrers, so we asked for them and they brought us what we needed. Genuinely helpful staff. I commend the hotel for hiring them and if I were their boss I would even give them raises because they made us feel so well taken care of. ",1,0.4848333333333333

Also we were in a room facing onto the main road outside and some of the traffic noise was a bit annoying.

I went to front desk in the morning and Phoenix was very understanding and was confused at our placement as there were rooms on the first floor available for what we had asked for. So after our wonderful trip at the Zoo, we had to come back and get a room with a TV that worked and a first floor as we were going to be leaving at 4am with quit a bit of luggage and didn't want to haul it all the way down the stairs or hallway and wake others trying to sleep. After this was all done we did have a comfortable room with a working TV. The location could not be beat in anyway as well as the price. The people at the front desk for the most part were great.

Surprisingly, no one checked up on me to see how I was doing.  I was very surprised they didn't check up on a guest?  I spoke (via email) to a manager later and since I fell at the pond near by (but not on 'their' property) they didn't think it was their duty?

So I went online to locate a medium-priced hotel convenient to friends and also to the museum.  I must have computer-karma, because this hotel that I found in a very brief search had everything I needed and wanted:  Across from the train station, clean, nice and efficient staff, commodious room and, very unexpectedly, an amazingly complete and delicious buffet breakfast, no matter what your breakfast habits might be.  The price was well within my range, as well.

661877059,We had an amazing time at the lodge. This was our first visit since the renovations have been completed and it was well worth the wait. From the moment we arrived we were greeted by Fernando &quot;Fernie&quot; and Don. They quickly greeted us and chatted up a storm with our kids. Our room wasn't ready when we arrived so we waited in the lobby and the kids played chess while they got our room sorted out. Fernie kept checking onhe status of the room and once it was done he got the key made for us and took us straight to our room so we didn't have to wait in the long line again. We are every meal in the Forte restaurant because my youngest daughter said it was the best pizza she had ever had. Special thanks to Angela and John in the restaurant. Also the bartenders working in the lobby bar on the evening of March 26th (guy and girl). They chatted with my 7 and 8 year old daughters and kept them entertained with bar cherries on a stick and Shirley Temples while i had a chance to catch up with old friends. I had the opportunity to attend Bridget's yoga class which was also I highlight of our trip. My girls loved the pool and we averaged 3 trips down per day. It was nice that we did not have to go in the pool every time because the the pool was a great set up for their age. There was ample setting and the hot tube was a great option while watching the kids. Overall has a fantastic trip and would highly recommend to young families. I also went to the Nordic spa.

It was clean and high end as well. We were on the first floor and were able to walk out the back door right to the outdoor lounge and pool area. The service was very friendly and attentive overall. They met our requests quickly and with kindness. It almost felt like we were in a small town, instead of a big city. The food was good and had very nice complex flavors.

Much later that night, the toilet was stopped up, but maintenance was to busy to fix it, so a plunger was delivered for us to do it. The toilet kept running the entire night. The following morning the toilet overflowed, so we weren't able to shower and we checked out.

All in all I would definitely stay there again and highly recommend them.  Thanks.",1,0.5167254079254078
5722357,"70 of us actually stayed at the Ocean Beach Hotel for a week in early July both in 2005 and 2006. 2005 was a family reunion and my &quot;Big 60&quot;. Because I live in San Diego, I got to handle all the room reservations. We had family from 10 different states, from 1 year olds to 80 year olds (20 under 20). It was the perfect place for our family to stay. It has a big beautiful flower-filled courtyard where the youngest kids could play safely during the day and where we had big family dinners in the evening. And it is right on the beach, so the older kids/young adults could spend their days at the ocean.Everybody who came from out of state had all these plans to see the other San Diego sights, but once they settled in, they realized how wonder it was just to stay in Ocean Beach, enjoy the beach, go to the Farmers Market on Wednesday night, enjoy the shops and restaurants of Newport Avenue, and spend lots of quality time with their cousins, etc. from all over the western U.S.Another important feature of Ocean Beach, especially for young families- or big families, is that the restaurants are very reasonably priced, including the wonderful family restaurant on the pier. Breakfast and lunch were inexpensive and then we would order take-out and have big family dinners in the courtyard of the hotel, making our own salads and having our own sodas and beer and wine. More time to spend with family and friends and much more affordable for everybody.The staff at the Ocean Beach Hotel is friendly, courteous, and incredibly helpful. They went out of their way to help with whatever we needed. Little did we (or they) know that we would be back 50 weeks later.This year was the wedding of Katie (from San Diego) who teaches with now-her-husband Matt in Honolulu. They chose the Thursday Club in Sunset Cliffs for the wedding and the Ocean Beach Hotel was the overwhelming choice for everyone to stay after our wonderful experience in 2005. I, of course, was delegated to handle the room reservations again.There were hardly any of the younger children this year, but lots of Matt's family and friends from the Pittsburg, PA area. I emailed them the website, but had them make the room reservations through me. Once again, the hotel staff helped immensely. It was great to see the reactions of the Pittsburg visitors. They said &quot; I know you said it was right on the beach, but it is really right on the beach!&quot; Once again, they had all these plans to see all the San Diego sights and then hardly left Ocean Beach.A big thank you to the Ocean Beach Hotel for helping make the Hughes family gatherings so special- two years in a row!Mike Hughes, San DiegoPat Hughes, Casper, WYDon Hughes, San DiegoBarb Sanford, Lewistown, MTMary James, Denver, CODebbie Eliason, Billings, MTJoe Hughes, Denver, COLaurie Hughes, Fairfield, CAAunts, cousins, nieces and nephews from MT, WY, CO, CA, MD, VA, IL, TX, HI, ORMatt's family and friends, Pittburg, Philly, FL",1,0.5418707482993197

We had previously stayed in a Manchester Ibis Budget hotel which was grim so we approached this hotel with trepidation. However we were met with a polite receptionist and checking in was quick and efficient. We had two rooms on the fourth floor. Access to the lift is by key card only, security conscious and reassuring particularly for single women travelling alone as we were. However only one of the lifts was working which meant waiting for some time as the other one was constantly in use. Our rooms were good and very clean. Each had an extremely comfortable double bed with a lovely mattress topper and reasonable pillows. There was a small cushioned bench/seat and a table/shelf under the window with a kettle, cups, tea and coffee provided.  The hanging and shelf space was minimal but we were only there one night. A  full length mirror, TV and several electric sockets finished off the room. The rooms overlooked the main road but the double glazed windows worked pretty well. It is impossible to soundproof a room with a main road directly below.I loved the shower room. It reminds me of a space capsule! It contained a washbasin, loo and shower. The loo was raised which I find so much more comfortable to use and the shower was excellent with plenty of hot water. Both washbasin and shower had a container with wash gel. I thought the towel was a little small but I am a big person so perhaps that isn't totally fair.When we returned late at night, entry to the hotel, like the lift, was only by key card, excellent security measure. People were having a drink at the bar, can't comment on that as we went straight to bed. Plugged in iPad and iPhone to recharge overnight and slept really well. The hotel looked full but we weren't disturbed by anyone walking up and down corridors or slamming doors as normally happens.,Woke in morning to discover the TV didn't work, then realised that actually none of the electrics worked! Not a total disaster as plugged my items into the sockets In the other room. Went out for breakfast, there far plenty of cafes etc in the vicinity, others were eating in reception, again can't comment.Returned after an early morning stroll around the area which is full of heritage buildings mixed in with modern architecture, well worth taking a look. We collected our bags and went to check out. I mentioned to the receptionist that the electrics didn't work and her reply was 'Well Why didn't you tell us last night?' Most aggressively. I replied I hadn't known last night and was telling her now. She didn't answer. I would have given this hotel four stars but for the out of order lift, the lack of electrics and most importantly, the rudeness of the receptionist on departure which is a shame. The hotel is very well positioned, five minutes walk from Piccadilly Station, close to trams and Piccadilly Gardens. It was well priced and good value.

198200474,"With the Spanish architecture, the expansive grounds and the swaying palm trees, this beautiful mansion looks like it should come straight out of a movie. That movie would also have a soundtrack from the Eagles album &quot;Hotel California&quot;. Make no mistake, &quot;it's a lovely place.&quot;But, for a hotel to rate five stars from me, it has to be more than beautiful. While this mansion has many amenities that hit the right notes, there were a few misplaced chords that have spoiled my recent stays here. Yes, I say &quot;stays&quot; because I've been here more than once, returning to see if those maladies were somehow one-offs nor not.One of my stays put me in a room right across the walkway from the ballroom and meeting halls. Big mistake. They start setting up those rooms at about 5 AM, wheeling in carts and clanging things around right outside your window. I didn't get much sleep that morning. That was one sour note that I've avoided from now on.All of my stays put me in a company approved &quot;regular room&quot;. This means I didn't stay in their top notch luxury suites. These regular rooms, while lovely to look at, are not all that practical. They are kind of small, not really geared towards business people that need a nice work desk and awkward to watch TV from any place other than the bed itself. Another off key twang.The breakfast is quite decent, but on one trip they moved it to a temporary room deep inside the mansion. It was difficult to find and not set up with everything as normal. For example, the omelet bar was not there, so you had to order an omelet as if you were at a regular restaurant and wait. I waited so long for it, my breakfast was really over by then. The sweet pastries are oddly not sweet at all. They look yummy, but are dull to eat. I don't know about you, but if I'm going to ingest needless calories by eating a muffin or croissant, I want it to at least taste nice and sweet and rich. Their breakfast sweets are such that once you it one, you never eat another again. Oh well, I guess they're saving me from myself so that I don't eat too many sweets?But, maybe I'm just being picky? After all, this place is gorgeously clean, has a wonderful outside patio to linger at, a nice pool and spa amenities and the staff is always friendly and helpful. It's also not a &quot;me too&quot; place that looks like any other place that I've been to. It's wonderfully unique. If you like going to live concerts to hear music played in real time, they're not always perfectly played, but they are wonderfully different.

427034781,"The location is everything! I could not imagine that we would open the window and see the tower right there. The experience is most beautiful in the evening when everyone has left and you can spend some quality time soaking up the atmosphere. The staff are most accommodating and the hotel is very quaint.The hotel is difficult to access if you've never been there. It's not actually much of a problem if you get the right instructions. Forget trying to drive up by car. Even though they say it's possible for a short while, it's not worth the hassle trying to needle your way through tiny one way streets; and then you're still almost a block away. Just find yourself a public parking as close to the tower as possible, grab your bags and walk the 10 or 15 min towards the tower. Then you'll find Via Santa Maria, the end of the pedestrian zone and the corner closest to the tower is your hotel. The walk is worth it!",1,0.4787114845938375

I wanted to keep my wonderful experience at the Le Priori to myself, but I am hoping that I will generate some good  Hotel Karma by sharing this review, at the risk of the Le Priori becoming too popular and perhaps difficult to reserve!  The hotel is small and intimate. I cannot say enough about the helpful and well informed staff.  The General Manager saw to every detail and always inquired as to how we were enjoying our stay. The complimentary breakfast was beautifully prepared and delicious, a great day to start a day of sightseeing. The rooms themselves were fabulous: a great mix of modern furnishings in an old brick building with the most comfortable beds ad duvets ever! The Location?  Perfect for  walking to all of Quebec City's wonderful sites.  I will most definitley return to this magical place!",1,0.685897435897436

The B&amp;B on the first floor of a 1930s building was opened in mid 2014 by Pasquale an architect who designed and managed the renovations himself. It is a simple and stylish place, all white with occasional splashes of colour, the terracotta tiled floor in our room (the one with the modern four poster bed) is an original feature. The room was large and comfortable with king size bed and high quality linen. There was a desk, plenty of power points, good wifi. The bathroom was fantastic: spotless, sparkling and with a large shower recess with a torrent shower and plenty of hot water. And complimentary toiletries. Australian visitors to Rhegion B&amp;B will love it!Breakfast was typical Italian with hard toasts, cheese, jams, juice, croissants and coffee.Pasquale speaks English and recommended good restaurants for us.We visited Reggio di Calabria so that we could see the Riace bronzes at the museum.

If you want a sterile, cookie cutter, &quot;same as I stayed at in.....&quot;, you will be disappointed.  If you want unique, friendly and trendy, this is the place to stay.We were attending the 2011 Hollywood Reel Independent Film Festival at the near by, New Beverly Cinema and wanted to stay in the area at a boutique hotel.  We were not disappointed.  The Farmer's Daughter Hotel appears to have been designed as a quintessential &quot;motor court&quot; in the 50's or 60's.  It has been redesigned and they have done an amazing job of working with in the constraints of the original structure.  We stayed in room 101, located in a quiet corner of the property.  I don't know what the other rooms look like so this is unique to 101.  The room is decorated with copper counter tops and accents throughout the room and includes a subtle continuation of the farm theme in the bedding and wall mural.  The bedding was very comfortable.  The faucet was style like an old fashioned sink pump.  The shower was simple but included an adjustable rain style head and there was plenty of hot water.The staff were all very friendly and attentive.  They made every attempt to accommodate us as we dealt with the logistics of visitors.  They helped us find a great place to eat - &quot;Animal&quot; - just up the street.  It didn't matter if it was midnight or 8 am, there was always a smile and helpful attitude.  Over all I cannot say enough about the facility and staff.

71168984,"I just got back in town yesterday from San Diego.  I booked this hotel through Bookit.com back in June based on the reviews on this website.  I got a deal that I was able to lower by looking at the prices again before I left.  Althought I got it cheaper, it still wasn't worth the $120/night.  If you travel to Vegas, staying here is like staying at Imperial Palace, it will do if you can get it for $80-$90/night.  But even with the free wifi, the $12/day to park is just ridiculous.  If it was 1/2 full (Mon-Thurs) stay, I would be shocked. Pluses:  Great pool although we only had 1 morning to swim.  The grounds including the pool were very clean.  Our room, although small, was clean in the sleeping area.  The staff was very accomodating and easy to contact.  The location for Sea World and San Diego can't be beat.Negatives:  The room is SMALL.  If you have more than 3 travelling, it is cramped.  The bathroom is even smaller.  Although it looks like the hotel room was redone, the bathroom needed more work as the tub was old and the grouting was moldy near the bottom.  Plus, the shower didn't drain.  As for the walls, paper thin.  I had a room with a door and I could hear everything in the next room.I will say that they did check us in early and were willing to move us from the front of the hotel that faced the road.  Even then, if there is another person staying next door, you will think they are in the room talking.  Add $12 to your price if you are renting a car.  Nothing special, but not worth what I paid.",0,0.4772331691297208

Plus the hall ways needed vacuuming. Our main gripe though is that it is just too noisy! The walls are paper thin (thank you to the amorous couple next door at 02.30 am) and the road traffic is just too much. We didn't have any of these issues when we stayed at Roomzzz.However, the staff were so nice and breakfast was delish that we decided not to complain, just to make a mental note not to return here.....I feel mean as the staff were great, the bed was comfy too but the hotel just wasn't for us..... sorry!",1,0.4746141975308642

Owner was greatly apologetic about missing half shower door as she was waiting for its installation, we had no problem to take showers, just used an extra towel like a curtain.

The decor in the general areas and the rooms was somewhat tired, mirrors held in place with adhesive tape, furniture knocked and chipped, sink wouldn't drain properly.One of the bed bases n the room was broken, which we reported to reception, a maintenance person came to have a look, said he would sort it out, then left, never to be seen again. Finally we chased reception again and they said we should swap for the room next door, though never even asked if we needed assistance to do so.

This motel is pet-friendly and I can understand why. The rooms are waaaaay outdated. The carpet was coming up, the shower looked like it was from at least the 80's, and the decor was atrocious. It was looked like a cheap porn could be shot there.They must have stolen the pics they show online from some other hotel, because this place was a dump. The only redeeming thing about this place is that it is a GREAT location to everything. And since it's not downtown, the traffic is great and it's only a 10 min drive to everything.

Someone was always available to answer questions and was always friendly. Our housekeeper was quick and efficient in cleaning our room everyday.

572130233,"We were just heading to Pisa from Florence when i got an e-mail that my credit card was declined for the Hotel Francesco payment. It was already a rainy day and this small piece of quality news was not making things better. I've had some issues with other providers too in different countries so i can't directly blame the hotel on that, but it was worth a mention. I got it sorted out by using my companions card and rebooking.I really liked the location, which was a bit away from the railway station (from where you can easily access the airport via the people mover), but it wasn't too much and we were able to whine our way through the rain. There were decent restaurants all around the place - next to it, across the road, 4 steps away, 20 steps away. Pisa tower itself even was right there to see. The room was a bit cold and humid and we didn't dare to touch the air conditioner as there were warning signs everywhere not to touch it so we just were under the blanket the whole time. The shower was alright, but the toilet system was weird. After flushing and hearing sounds which i could swear were the sounds of the satan pooping, it took a lot of time 'til you could flush again. The breakfast was modest - continental one. You were able to toast your own bread and mix things up a bit. There was of course coffee, which didn't taste like much, but every morning coffee is a good morning coffee.In general i was okay with the stay, but would probably try some other place when i am back in Pisa.",0,0.5052197802197802

405916387,"The Hayes was an interesting hotel.  It is a converted Mansion from the turn of the century with an interesting history.  I stayed there for business for three weeks, each week in a different section of the hotel (long story).  The grounds are very nice and the outdoor patio is a great place to unwind after a long day.  The rooms are a little dated, but nice.  The first room that I stayed in had two queen beds and was nice-sized.  The second room was smaller but had a king bed.  The third room was a queen size bed and the smallest of the three.  They were all fine, though.  Internet is included, but some areas have a better signal than others. The cell reception in the rooms was often spotty. The downside to this hotel is that there is no real restaurant.  There is a large breakfast buffet (not included), but if you want dinner, you have to eat in the bar, which is not set up with tables, or order room service.  I thought it very odd that there was no actual restaurant for dinner, but if you don't mind driving, there are many restaurants nearby.  The staff was very accommodating, and when I needed copies made of documents, they helped out at any time of night.  The library off the main entrance area was a nice place to work as well.  Overall, it was a nice place to stay.One other note: I left an expensive pair of linen pants and a linen shirt in one of the drawers when I checked out.  Two hours later, when I remembered that I had left them, I called the hotel, and told them exactly where I had left them and that I would be back on Sunday and would pick them up then.  When I got back, the manager told me that they were not in the drawer.  Now, I'm no expert, but in two hours, there are a limited number of people with access to the room, all of which can be tracked.  Despite that, they were unable to find my clothes.  Moreover, even if someone had subsequently checked into the room, the hotel clearly knew who checked in and could have politely asked if they had found my clothes.  Not a tremendous deal, but I had gotten the clothes in St. Tropez, and it irked me that they could not or were unwilling to locate my clothes.  So word to the wise . . . use the safe and be careful about leaving anything!",1,0.4183673469387755

I had to choose to either close the window and suffocate or leave open and listen to sirens and loud mopeds.Then the towels were not towels but cloth, but when I asked to get the proper once the owner gave them with surprised face.Next thing I was trying to take a shower and miserably failed as the tub drain was blocked and water level started raising. There was some dirt and hair floating as I guess the tube was not cleaned before our check in. The owner started explaining that &quot;the guy&quot; will come to fix it next day. I explained that it was already midnight and I needed shower and didn't want to wait till next day for the guy to come and fix it. The owner then said that it must have been previous guest who has done it which confirmed my suspicion that the bathroom wasn't cleaned after last check out otherwise they would have noticed the problem when cleaning the tub. I have also noticed hair on the floor and around the sink. There was plenty of time to clean the place, we only arrived around 11 p.m. ... The owner then disappeared for half an hour and came back with the tool to fix the drain which took him another 20 mins or so... So it was past the midnight before we were able to take a shower at still not cleaned bathroom. The night was very hot and noisy. The only mean of temperature control was open window and floor fan which did not help at all.It seamed to me the owner didn't give a [--] at all. They simply rent out their private rooms (there is only one bathroom for the whole house including owners btw). And I must say the prices were not cheap either, you can easily find something better for this money in Pisa.

We were assigned, by luck, room 41, which is a bit special. The room has a lot of character with rehabilitated brick and two nice windows. It overlooks the courtyard and restaurant but the heavy curtains are sufficient to cover the little noise if you need to sleep early. The most remarkable item, however, is that it happens to have a 8 1/2&quot; Tempur-pedic Rhapsody bed, prob. a 2010-11 model. My wife and I slept deep and felt rested despite the heavy amount of trekking that we did going up and down the hill. We also took the one day tour to the city (half-day) and the east country (half-day).  Honestly, the city part is better explored by foot.  We even had done the fields by trekking up the boardwalk (about a 20 min hike -for river view stops- and 350 steps or so). Restaurant is &quot;tapas&quot; type, and one of the best in the city.  Very nice ambience and relatively quiet, allowing conversation over wine and extraordinary good food.  If we come back again, I will rebook this hotel again.",1,0.5618326118326119

392282299,"You see good and bad when, over 30 years of hotels on business and pleasure, you rarely get a perfect stay.It happened here.I booked a junior suite,, and based on previous comments from people about their room being &quot;too small&quot;,  I'm glad I did, but I'll get back to that.From the moment we walked in the front door, I was impressed. Receptionists ( yes, all of them) were so friendly and professional, even leaving the desk to take us to our room.At one point during our stay,  we had to book the hop on hop off bus tour from our hotel. The receptionist we spoke to asked us, which receptionist we had made our initial enquiry with, so that she would get the commission on our booking. Now, that to me is really professional. The girl we actually booked with could have taken that commission, but she insisted we identified the initial contact, so she would get the dosh.Very impressive.On our last night, we had some issues of noise from another guest. Screaming children, loud talking,still going on at 1am. The sort of thing that can happen. I just mentioned it in passing, to reception the next morning.On check out, reception deducted $60 from my bill.An impressive gesture. Not asked for or expected.So, to the room.Wow.For the money, such good value.Look at the web page and you will be impressed, but the reality is better.The decor is very modern and impressive.A huge and impressive bathroom with open plan shower. My wife tried tried and loved the Jacuzzi.The bed was super comfyThere was even a fridge for me to put my beer and my wife's wine in, well chilled for our return.Spacious, comfortable, we just loved itBreakfast was classed as continental. Well, not as we know it, JimScrambled eggs, bacon, sausage were amongst the cooked items.I asked one morning for poached eggs.No problem.Add in the lovely coffee, fruit, baked goodies,  I left a stone heavier.It's the whole package. The location, staff, accommodation. Just fabulous.A wee tip. We arrived via train, and a $10 taxi ride.

It sits on the very edge of Sunset Cliffs and offers beautiful views of the Pacific and coastline.  If you like ocean breezes and the sound of waves crashing into the shoreline and bulkheads, then this is the place for you.  It is not Georges V however.  Services are limited as this was always a family run hotel/apartments.  We stayed in the Garvie Presidential Suite as it was a 45th anniversary.  The room has windows directly facing the Pacific.  It is probably overpriced for what it offers, but how does one explain this - it was worth it. It does need additional privacy curtains or shades.  Other rooms are not directly overlooking the ocean but are basic efficiency apartments. Parking is limited but we didn't have any problem over a holiday weekend.

Even when there was a mistake on our bill at checkout (they charged us for 4 extra breakfasts), there was no question about it once I showed that breakfast was included through my booking on Expedia, and they ripped the paper up. They also gave us excellent recommendations for place to eat (which we always appreciate). Breakfast:Breakfast was wonderful. There was about a dozen options for breakfast. They all tasted fantastic. Even if your breakfast is not included, I would be tempted to eat here as it is a great price! There is also an option to have breakfast delivered to your room if you like.

The reception staff clearly enjoy their work and know how to present a warm and professional welcome. A member of staff carried suitcases to the room, which was in the main hotel (and he also warned us against pickpockets in the centre). The staff at breakfast were efficient and smiley, and you get the impression that the team spirit amongst the staff is really good.The building- an old villa? - has been superbly fitted out, with great attention to detail. The bed was extremely comfortable, the furnishings were lovely, and it was good to find a hotel that offers quality hangers in the wardrobe and has little touches such as anti-mosquito machines in the bedroom drawers. The terrace overlooking the garden is great for a pre or post dinner drink, and despite being only a stone's throw from the major attractions the hotel is in a quiet residential neighbourhood. The offer of an airport transfer for 6 euros per person was also a nice touch.My only quibble would be that the shower cubicle didn't match the quality elsewhere. In my room the bathroom was large, but the cubicle was small, and, as there was a fixed shower head above the centre of the shower, it was impossible to escape the flow of water. Not a huge problem, but not ideal. Also, this was the only hotel I have experienced in Italy which provided a kettle and cups. That was great - but no tea and coffee were left, so it wasn't much use. Complimentary water in the fridge would have been a nice touch, but they are very minor points and overall this is somewhere I would highly recommend for a stay in Pisa!",1,0.5736961451247166

Overall impression - beautiful Victorian hotel with a history located on Royal Street, close to Preservation Hall, Cafe du Monde, the better antiques shops, local grocery (for beer and wine), close to major restaurants (Brennan's is down the street, Mr. B's as well), and a block off Bourbon Street (critical for us as we aren't late-night partiers).  The hotel, which may not have all of the amenities of the larger hotels (Bourbon New Orleans, Place D'Armes, the chains) such as a bar and dining room, more than compensates for that with charm, a well-trained and attentive staff (special note to Janna and Ms. Sandra the maid), coffee in the morning, above average rooms (nice beds) and antiques decor in a &quot;Victorian&quot; setting (I am restoring a two-hundred year old house so my eye is trained for these things).  The house itself is undergoing - according to a lengthy and informative posting I read by the VP of the management firm in response to an &quot;average&quot; review) - a slow but steady series of improvements in its carpets, infrastructure, and general amenities.  On-site parking available for $35/day but if you don't need your car, do the valet for the same amount - my receipt shows me they store it in the Bourbon Orleans Hotel garage, which is secure.  The desk staff was very receptive to my questions, had literature available, helped steer me away from questionable areas after dark (NPR just did a story on crime in the French Quarter) with a map with highlighted &quot;no-go&quot; areas.  The building itself needs additional exterior/interior TLC (also the balcony, which is wonderful, needs a little repair work and paint, but fully sound); I would lose the &quot;gold&quot; paint on the plaster and wood trim on the ceiling and walls - first of all, it's not &quot;period&quot; and second, it looks a trifle garish - but I fully understand this is a property in transition to a higher standard.  Overall presentation is very welcoming and will appeal to experienced travelers who like older places with more character that serve as more than just a bed and a place to shower.  I would suggest repairing the cast iron fireplace cover in room 12 - it is broken and simply having the piece leaning against the fireplace looks a bit slipshod. (and lose the gold paint - it should be black).  This is supposed to be the most-photographed hotel in NO - and it seemed to be that way given the numbers of folks stopping to take photos of the cast-iron fence and the house.  I would especially recommend this hotel to Europeans who want a quintessential American experience - as the house is a historic structure.

The room and hotel in general were great and clean, but what made it exceptional begins with when I first walked in to the lobby, and a very nice young lady named Alyssa greeted me and proceeded to help me with my checking in, information about my room/Hotel, and went above and beyond by calling the room later to make sure that everything is excellent! I was here for a week for work business trip so I got to try Charlie's Restaurant/BBQ. There, I received some of the best service ever, by a very nice lady named Jeanne. She was so caring and kind, recommended great food, and provided excellent service! On two of the few days I've been here, it was very rainy! Luckily, a young man named Fernando was a great help by driving me around from the room to the convention center, providing with me with excellent information about San Diego. On my last day, I need pencils and calculator.

The amenities provided are excellent and the food is abundant and delicious. The hotel is eco-conscious as well. There are so many things to do and so many places to eat that it would be hard to get bored.

414240309,Ok.. so let's start with the positives... The Location was GREAT.. but ONLY if you had a car. I certainly would NOT liked to have walked to and from the centre with children. The rooms themselves were OK? The bathroom was a bit grubby but with a bit of a rinse around the shower we survived.The quality of linen and pillows were poor. I really would expect 2 pillows per person and for them to be of good quality but then this is a hotel pretending to be a 5 star hotel!The pool was lovely however and it was nice to be able to return after some hot sightseeing for a swim.And now the negatives... well this is by no means a five star hotel. Not even close. This is a very average 4 star hotel and if they had advertised this as a four star then actually I would have given it a very different write-up.

The pool was not horrible but there were some bugs, leaves and what I can only imagine and hope was a caterpillar at the bottom of the pool.

Couple of small negatives - the lighting is very subtle, even in the bathroom so makes putting on make up a little challenging.  There is no plug near a mirror however, I am lucky that my hairdryer has a long lead so managed to use the one in the kitchen area.

196691432,"I had stayed at this hotel about a year ago and had a horrible experience. Just bad after bad after bad. I wrote a review/letter to the hotel and to my surprise they called me to apologize and offer me a free night stay. I had actually denied it at first but then thought I should give them a second chance as I have had several friends stay here and like it. So I accepted, however it has taken me a year to go back because of my issues. I booked an additional night also as we and another couple were celebrating my birthday. From the moment I walked in it was a completely different hotel. Josie at the front desk was awesome along with the gentleman that was standing next to her (I wish I could remember his name to give him props as well). When my friends arrived a few minutes later, she came in saying Happy Birthday to me. Josie immediately asked if it was my birthday and gave all of us drink coupons and free buffet coupons. She went above and beyond. Our room was much better this trip and we hung out at Charlie's both Friday and Saturday night. Playing pool, drinking beers, listening to music and just having a great time. Cindy (I think that was her name) was great at Charlie's. When we arrived back to our room from a long day of sightseeing and bar hopping, we walked in to find a cheese/cracker and fruit tray with a note saying Happy Birthday. Totally did not expect that. I will definitely book this hotel again and it just goes to show that sometimes people and places deserve a second chance. I would say this even if I didn't have things handed to me for free. I had a great time, and everything was clean. The grounds are immaculate (which was the only nice thing I had to say the last time I stayed). It's nice to just walk around and enjoy how nicely maintained the grounds are. There is a mall right behind the hotel and you can catch the trolley right behind also. Again I am glad I gave this hotel a second chance.",1,0.5421768707482992

It was a ripoff because their most expensive dish with coffee doesn't even equal that amount. That was annoying and deceiving. I still don't see the point.2. The bath was stopped up.

We always stay at La Quinta due to the pet policy and our dog, so we didn't think twice about it. Unfortunately, this one wasn't up to other La Quinta standards. First, upon check-in I was informed of an 8 dollar per night parking fee, which was not advertised to me in any way prior to booking. I asked for it to be waived due to our length of stay and they would only lower the cost to 5 dollars a night. Rooms for guests with pets are on the first floor, which is fine, but not every person is responsible with their animals and left them in the room while they would go out, leaving barking dogs unattended. The breakfast didn't include any usual La Quinta items like eggs, bacon, potatoes, etc, but it was okay and sufficient. Our big issue was with the customer service. Not only would they not waive our parking fee, but one morning around 10:30 am the wi-fi stopped working. I alerted the front desk and they tried resetting the router, but it didn't work. It was still out that evening around 10 pm, so we called back and the young man working spoke to us like we just didn't know how to turn on our devices correctly. We decided to call AT&amp;T uverse about the outage and they confirmed it was out in guest rooms. We called the front desk again in the morning after it had been 24 hours of no free wi-fi as advertised and advised them what AT&amp;T told us and finally someone reset all their equipment and it worked again.

I liked the location and the value.  The staff was friendly, but not very helpful.  There were no towels for the pool and I was told that it wasn't possible to get any.  I guess only housekeeping new where they were.  There was only decaf coffee in the rooms and no service information.  If I hadn't had so many issues, The doors are a little thin.  So when room service carts were rolling past the door at 6am, it woke me up, as did the filling of the pool at 7am.  I would stay here again based on the location and value, but only if it was convenient.  ",0,0.6436363636363637

553765634,"We stayed at Hotel Le Priori after the fire that damaged the Toast restaurant as well as the building with the main rooms.  Prior to our arrival, we received an email indicating they had a fire but that the reception area and the building with the suites were undamaged and they were happy to welcome us.  We thought about re-booking to another hotel but in the end decided to give it a try.  The suites building is separate from the building were reception is located by a small courtyard.  We were in a junior suite on the 3rd floor with a fireplace.  I'll start with the room itself.  The bathroom had a separate jacuzzi type bathtub that was fantastic.  The shower was large an also fantastic (great water pressure and hot hot water if you so chose).  The vanity area was spacious and the amenities plentiful.  There was a separate small heater in the bathroom to keep it toasty in early January.  I wish they had heated floors in the bathroom but other that we were quite pleased.  The bedroom itself was spacious with a working fireplace and logs replaced daily.  We had a Nespresso coffee maker, small refrigerator, a microwave, wine glasses, coffee cups, etc.  Great little kitchenette area!The bed was comfortable... not the most comfortable I've ever slept on but not the worst.  The pillows were a bit too soft for my taste but hey not everyone likes a firm pillow.  Lighting in the room was abundant as was the closet space.  The heating was just right and easy to control throughout our stay.They had arranged for free breakfast at the Hotel 71 across the street due to the fire at the Toast restaurant.  The breakfast was not really to our taste (I had an egg casserole one morning and it was like reheated quiche... rubbery and rather tasteless actually) so we ended up going to a local bakery for chocolate croissants and coffee for half of our stay.The location is fantastic... right in the heart of the old city but on a slightly less touristy street so that it was quite.  You are about 2 blocks from Place Royale and about 4 blocks from the Funicular which will take you up to the toboggan run (highly recommend) and the Chateau Frontenac.  We had a car and they offered parking at a covered garage about 3 blocks away for $16'ish/night.All in all, I'd give the room itself an A+.Why I gave this review 3 stars was for two reasons:1.  On our 2nd day we opened the door to walk through the reception area to go back out through the courtyard to access the entrance to our building and were meet with a surly reception person who not so politely told us to use the alley way to the left of the building to get where we were going rather than walking through the reception area.  The way she delivered the message made us feel like 2nd class guests.  Had we known about the alternate passageway we might have opted to use it but as a paying guests I think we should have been allowed to walk through the reception area if we so choose.and 2.  On our last day there the streets became quite icy.  The courtyard, the aforementioned passageway and the front of the hotel had not been salted or cleaned and we were left to slip slide away, almost falling several times.In summary, while the room was great, the service was not all that I had expected given the previous reviews.",1,0.4346913580246913

We were actually transferred here after another hotel (Beside Airport) overbooked and ran out of room despite our reservation, so staying at Locanda was not of our own choosing but out of necessity. Pisa was simply a one day stop for our journey to Rome, and this hotel was certainly adequate for that. Our room consisted of a nice-sized entry sitting room, a bedroom, and a decent bathroom. The location is excellent, as the hotel is surrounded by many good restaurants, and just around the corner is the leaning tower. They also do have free wifi.However, we had a few problems. The primary issue was that all three of the administrators with whom we interacted couldn't speak basic English. If you know what you're doing, that shouldn't be a problem. However, if you need assistance beyond directions to the train station or if any issues arise with your stay, you will have a bit of trouble communicating. There is also no air-conditioning (which is really a necessity in mid-summer). Our belongings were moved around during cleaning (shoes put away in the wardrobe, toiletries put in cupboards, etc.), which we felt was unnecessary and a bit intrusive.However, the administrators were in general friendly and the accommodations tolerable.

When I first walked in I could tell that the rooms had not been vacuumed properly.  There were 4 very long black hairs on the sofa and throughout the suite.  There were also small pieces of paper and fabric in the carpet.  I called the front desk and the Housekeeping manager came to my room within 10 minutes and vacuumed the whole area.  He also used a fabric roller on the sofa.  I took a shower before going out to my event that evening.  The shower was very nice with great shampoo, conditioner and body wash.  There was an engraved sign (see photo) warning guests not to turn the shower handle past the OFF designation and that it could be expected that the shower would drip for a few minutes.  When I returned back from my event at 11pm, the shower still had a steady stream of dripping.  I called the front desk and was told that , &quot;The engineers are gone for the day.&quot;  I countered by saying that since there was the engraved sign, this dripping was a known problem and that the hotel should be able to handle it 24/7.  Again I was told that the engineers were gone for the day. The only way I would go back to the hotel for anything would be to visit the open air restaurant, The Roof on the top of the hotel.

It has its own car park, means access from Vancouver is extremely easy and the hotel is very easy to find as well. You can walk the whole of Whistler directly from the hotel, and go hiking through the several areas without having to use public transport. Location wise it can't get better than this.-----------------------------------------------------------------------Hotel / Rooms:The hotel is a huge, very cozy, building, with multiple floors of rooms. However you never get the feeling of a sterile environment, it's very nicely and warm inside and especially in the winter it's the right spot to hang out after a day skiing. We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite, looking at the valley, which was very nice and came with a big kitchen, very cozy sofa area. The beds were extremely comfortable, probably the biggest mattress I've ever slept on. And the best thing was the jacuzzi on the roof top. Make sure to pay a visit. Towels are available at the roof, so no need to bring any up with you. We didn't try the breakfast as we had a suite with kitchen and cooked for ourselves.-----------------------------------------------------------------------EXTRA GOOD:+ Rooftop Jacuzzi+ Location in the heart of Whistler+ Warm Hotel+ Ok pricedBAD:- The only thing I have to complain about is, that the last time we visited, the lifts got closed for maintenance and we spend a weekend up there without being able to do anything.

So if somebody walks in the room anybody can see you in front of the sink/mirror.  Wasn't as quiet as I would have liked but it wasn't traffic it was the other patrons.  There were quite a few inconsiderate patrons on the floor.  It wasn't a party or anything just yelling down the hall very late night/early in the morning.

We also had a lovely balcony.Upon check in we had friends drop us at the new tower, there was no signage outside to tell us we were in the right place.We made it up to our room and there was hair all over the bathroom.  We called the front desk and they sent someone to clean it up.Night number two the light outside our door was out so I called the front desk.  They immediately sent someone but with a bulb to replace a light inside the room.  The light didn't get changed.  I then called every night for the next 5 nights of our stay, it never got replaced.The convention center is in need of some attention.  The lighted signs outside are missing half of the letters, attention is needed to landscaping.I wanted so badly to love this hotel, it's so close to the trolley and the mall the location is great.The bar on site closes at 11PM on the weekends, how is this possible?I know they are undergoing a multi million dollar registration, I wish them nothing but the best.

320696057,"I've had many day spa experiences at St.Anne's over the last few years which had all been positive, I had not been back to the day spa for several years since my most recent experience.  Needless to say I was quite taken aback by the many changes, most of them not positive.The spa looks the same so I assumed that it would be like it always had been in the past, I was wrong.  While not totally bad, I left thinking that I would not be returning, something I never thought in the past. Firstly, I loved the Aveda products they used, they have done away with those and are using their own versions which just are not of the same quality. I was disappointed with that.Secondly they appear to pack the place, I had never had that experience before.  All the relaxation rooms were full, the hot tubs, sauna, everywhere was just packed.  I know its not St.Anne's fault, but the majority of the people there acted like they were in a bar.  Loud talking and laughing, people were laying accross on the couches taking up all the seating space, people spending hours in the hot tubs talking loudly and  blocking others from using it.  It appeared to be packed with middle aged or older women who were obviously there for a girls ruckus weekend and unfortunately they were oblivious to any kind of spa etiquette, or maybe worse, they just didn't care.  I only fault the spa for letting them take over, seems that St. Anne's is no longer operating as a quiet, serene place as the staff made no efforts to quell this behaviour and actually engaged in it themselves!Thirdly I was disappointed with the change-room, again it was packed.  Older ladies took over completely and were using the space as a lounge, again, not necessarily St. Anne's problem totally.Lastly, although the massage was great while it lasted, I hated that I was shorted on the time by quite a bit.  I was called in at approximately 11:25 for a 11:15 appointment, then the therapist took more time going over my health form and asking a bunch of questions, this was another 7 mins, then he finished 5 mins early.  All tolled  my 1 hour massage only ended up being just under 40 mins...not a big deal but when mixed with the other difficulties it added to the disappointment.In short my friend and I agreed that we would not be back.  A spa experience to us just does not match what St. Anne's is anymore.  We believe that a spa experience should be quiet and serene with plenty of relaxation-a change from our high stress demanding jobs.  St. Anne's just seems like it wants to pack the place with boomers looking for a party-not our cup of tea!",1,0.4847615039281706

Nicely decorated, clean, surprisingly quiet for downtown.The staff that we dealt with were excellent. We ate all our meals, lunch dinner, breakfast, in the hotel restaurant, which was just fine.

Great place to stay at!!!</span><span class=""taLnk ulBlueLinks moreBtn"" onclick=""widgetEvCall('handlers.clickExpand', event, this);"">More</span>",1,0.4463333333333334
100212791,All previous reviews are spot on. A delightful hotel. And photos are a true representation. Exactly what I wanted to renew my memory lane visit to LA. The surrounding streets are a delight to walk around. Being a block off Wilshire Blvd. it was easy for me to get around without a car as there are corner stops for #20 bus &amp; one block walk to Fairfax &amp; Rapid bus. Free internet too. Good continental breakfast. Reception people were very helpful.,1,0.5750000000000001
190231241,"Our recent stay at this property was not what we expected.  We entered the resort area from a side entrance and had a lot of trouble finding the front desk.  At check-in, we thought we were going to be in a suite, but we were in a standard room.  We were uncomfortable with the entrance to the rooms as they are all outside entrances and did not feel as secure as we are used to.  The rooms did not feel clean and fresh, and we had a large bug scurry across the floor.  We liked the location as it is central to many attractions.  It is very convenient to walk to the Fashion Valley Mall from the hotel.  Overall it felt like a ghost town to us and was not the best fit for our family.",0,0.3928571428571428

You will not want for anything. They are great with kids and we saw a lot of guests with children during our stay over the Canada Day weekend. The rooms are impeccably clean and the amenities are great. If you can get a view overlooking the river, even better. Even M. Frontenac - who the hotel is named after - made an appearance, dressed in his 18th century finery! He was great for the kids in the lobby. If you visit Quebec City, you will want to stay here for sure. Thanks Fairmont for an amazing vacation. We will be staying at other Fairmonts again. Five stars PLUS.",1,0.6699735449735449

We didn't complain because we weren't in Pisa to hang out in the  room.  The best part of the stay was the breakfast.  They have eggs, bacon, cheeses,  meats, breads,  cereal, fruit, juice, tea,  coffee.  Something for everyone. By far the best breakfast at a hotel during our stay in Italy. This hotel is located in a perfect location.  Within walking distance  to the leaning tower, and very close to the train station.  This was an ok hotel overall, actually much better than other hotels we saw in the area.",1,0.561845238095238

The front desk personnel were always pleasant and helpful, the rooms clean and quiet. The bedroom furnishings are a bit dated, not all old enough to be &quot;antique&quot;, some of the bathrooms were updated in the last ten years, others not. I recommend requesting a room with a view of the river. Other rooms seemed a bit dreary. The lobby provides several sitting areas and free wifi. The breakfast room is nice and airy with a more than adequate offering of choices. The stairwell is grand...and a much better choice than the elevator.",1,0.5161764705882353

Checking was easy and efficient, I had a small room on the 3rd floor but with a huge bathroom and a jacuzzi bath.The hotel is well placed in Pisa, next door to the main shopping area and a short walk across the river to the older areas and the Duomo and leaning tower. I was able to walk to the tower, and all though the old streets, the shopping area and back to the hotel in a couple of hours.Room was clean and tidy, lots of fluffy towels, comfortable bed and free wifi which was easy to connect to using the codes in the room.Breakfast was typically continental but with bacon and eggs as well.If you book through the website, the shuttle bus back to the airport is free.For a longer stay I think I'd like a slightly lager room and one with a view, but I would certainly stay again.",1,0.4589285714285714
439793458,"Stayed here for one night as part of a special offer they were running. I wasn't expecting a lot due to only having paid Â£10 for the room. But my expectations were far exceeded. It's a cracking little place, and the rooms are very large even for the basic ones. It sort of feels rather like a chic/boutique hotel, and there are a lot of designer aspects like the bathroom and the sleeping area. The four-poster bed adds to that too, as does the fantastic waterfall shower.Guy at reception was very friendly, and we had a good chat about the hotel and various things. It's well placed right in the city centre, and I could imagine that this would be a great place to stay for a week or so if you needed to.Can't really fault it. All round excellent, and definitely somewhere I'd stay again in the future.",1,0.5716269841269841

We were upgraded and he took care of the shuttle booking and prepared a fantastic breakfast box because we were to leave the hotel before the buffet opens.The room was very nicely decorated and the hotel is ideally located, very close to the Pisa tower.However, the room was a bit smelly and stuffy. We had to open the window for four hours to let some fresh air in and the water in the bathroom was not clear at all, especially in the bath tub, and had a horrible taste. Just do not drink tap water there.

I had a good dinner there and the calamari wrap was excellent. Breakfast at Trellisesâ was also excellent, pricey, but the service from Angelica was second to none. Dinner there was not that great.

Kitchenette, desk, table/chairs and bed. Bathroom was large and well appointed. Decor was blah, more like a Hampton Inn style than  one of the nice Hiltons. The view from the room was awful, we kept the drapes closed. I'm a diamond member for Hilton but there were no real perks for this status, just breakfast vouchers, no upgrades or fruit trays, and no executive lounge.If you are looking for a more luxurious stay, try the Fairmont.

34260294,"The website gave a great idea of the beauty of the grounds, but the rooms will extremely disappointing.  First of all, the decor was extremely outdated with mirrored walls in the rooms, blue carpet, and brass accents everywhere.  The same creepy picture of a Victorian-era girl was in each room in our building, along with torn wallpaper in some.  There were no refrigerators, microwaves, or vending services in or near the rooms.  There were a few machines near the pools, but that was a hassle from the 7th floor.  Wi-fi internet was available for $9.95 a day, which was frustrating for a business trip.  The gym also cost extra money.  The restaurants on site were overpriced, but tasted good.  Nothing like being nickeled and dimed the whole time!  Our check-in was extremely chaotic, but the staff was very patient, helpful, and calm through the entire process.  They even set out coffee and cookies while we waited.

248965418,"We stayed at this hotel the first weekend of January at the end of our Christmas holidays. Check-in: We had booked a package through our credit card rewards program that provided many perks such as - upgraded room based on availability, included breakfast, and a dining credit.  Upon attempting to check-in early (2pm), our room was not ready, and so we left our bags with concierge and headed to the spa where we had an appointment. When finally able to check-in, we were told that the package we booked with all of the 'extras' was not showing on our reservation, even though I had an email with confirmation of the booking and all promised upgrades (which I happily provided to them).  Apparently because we didn't book directly with the hotel, they cannot necessarily honour this type of package?? I would beware of such a thing if you are considering booking this way. They ended up offering us the package with everything included IF we were willing to pay an extra $20 a night. There was nothing we could do, either we reverted to a basic room with nothing for the price we already paid, or we paid extra to get what we previously thought was part of the rate we signed up for.  I was not happy about this.  I had a confirmation of the package, and we had pre-paid and everything, our original rate should have been honoured... I'm still confused as to why it was not! On top of this, the fee for wifi and the required valet parking is absurd (how is it still legal to charge for wifi in this day and age!?). All of this added up, the stay was much more expensive than we had anticipated, even with our existing knowledge that we weren't staying somewhere cheap. Other disappointments: The lobby: beautiful, though had a very strange, constant smell, and also, reminds me of an airport.. with so many people coming and going all the time, but its a giant hotel, so I get it. The bathroom in our Deluxe, upgraded king room: the renovated rooms are fine, though I agree with a previous review I had read that they seem oddly placed in this hotel where the style everywhere else is quite different. Our only real complaint about the room was the bathroom. It was so small! And on top of this, we had a shower-only room. The glass shower was designed in such a way so that it was very narrow and so that the door was on the opposite side than what you would expect, forcing you to lean into the shower, underneath the shower head, to turn on the water. It was the silliest shower design I've ever seen! Beware of this! I turned it on the first time still in my clothes and got soaked... there was no way around it, and no easing slowly into a hot shower, if you're turning it on.. you're getting instantly drenched with the not-yet-warm water! A couple of minor items: The Starbucks on-site closes quite early, we went to get a treat and coffee at 7:30pm and they were closed. And finally, at one point we were in desperate need of some Tylenol; you'd expect a huge hotel like this to have a convenience post/store of some sort but they do not, so we had to walk and find a pharmacy, which was fine in the end, but we just found this odd.  The silver lining is that the location of the hotel is fantastic and even in very cold weather it is walkable to everything in old Quebec, which is very nice.  We ate dinner and breakfast at Le Bistro Sam, and the food was amazing, as well as the atmosphere and views of the river, I would highly recommend.

When we first arrived, the lady at the front desk let us know that our room had not been cleaned yet so we were bumped up to a room with a patio (which was awesome). The rooms are small but all you need to do is sleep and shower, right? Us and our dog loved the patio and hanging out there. If you leave the door open during the night (we didn't need the AC on) you can hear the street noise and those partying but it really isn't that bad. You are right in the middle of everything. There is an awesome fish taco place right across the street- go upstairs to the bar and you will have an amazing view of the ocean. It is cash ONLY and 21+. The hotel is right on the beach and the dog beach is a really short walk.There are &quot;bums&quot; on the streets but they aren't a bother and keep to themselves. They are really just hippies who never left the 60's which is OK because wouldn't it be nice if we could all live that way :)Overall, great hotel and price for the location especially if you have a furry friend.

Everything in the bathroom worked well (except for the phantom flushing with my toilet).  Several complimentary bottles of water are provided in the mini fridge, which was terrific. The room and hotel in general were quiet.  Since I am a Starwood Preferred Member, I had access to the lounge in the hotel for happy hour and breakfast. I didn't find the happy hour to be much of anything - some fruit, veggies and dip, appetizer sized empanadas that I think might have been frozen and heated up and coffee (no hot water to make tea though there were tea bags out). They also had beer and wine if I recall correctly that were available for a fee. They had the movie Gravity playing on the large TV as well. Since I wasn't too impressed with happy hour, I didn't try breakfast.  I also wasn't impressed with my burger and fries from the restaurant in the hotel. I wanted a well-done burger that ended up being almost too dry and tough to eat. My fries were some of the worst I've had. Yet, the cobb salad I had another night was tasty.  I used the gym, which is a couple treadmills and elipticals and one recumbent bike.  They had some dumbbells, one bench and some exercise balls.  There is water available in the gym too.  I got the workout I wanted so I was satisified. The hotel is near the freeways we needed to perform our work. A mall was across the street and there were a couple gyms and restaurants nearby.

As usual, a little research on events wouldn't have gone amiss.Anyway, check in was fast and the receptionist (Hannah?) quickly pointed out alternative car parks. The room was great - we had splurged on an Executive King and it was very comfortable. Lovely big bed adorned with a rose petal heart. A plate with choices was on the table - Happy Anniversary! it said. A shame it wasn'tâ¦but it was the thought that counts.Lobby and drinks were pleasant. We spent 10 minutes reading the Mancunian wall. A nice distraction.Bathroom toiletries were a little sparse - good job I had brought my own for showering as that little bottle wouldn't have gone far between 2 of us. Shower was great - lovely rainfall type.We weren't overly impressed with breakfast. There was a continental buffet, which was small and the cooked option is on order. We sat for a good half hour before it arrived and it was tiny. We had eaten at the 'all you can eat' Beefeater breakfast earlier that week for 8.95 and this paled in comparison.Overall, a great place to stay with comfortable rooms and very helpful friendly staff.

My room, a single was a little tired but was clean and the shower room acceptable.  However is was at front of the hotel overlooking the street and traffic started passing about 5.00 a.m. rather earlier than I like.   Unusually there were tea and coffee facilities and a fridge in my room.  I had to ask for milk for tea but that was provided  without any fuss.  The breakfast offered was excellent and on the Sunday particularly spectacular.  I found the staff very good and helpful and used the shuttle service, which runs every half hour, to get to the station, costs 3 Euros which I thought very reasonable.

207420992,"We had to take an emergency trip for my grandmother's end days and quickly had to book a hotel room. Upon arrival, I was not sure that I was going to like this hotel. It looks a bit dated from the outside and I've never been a fan of hotels with outside entrances. I did not have high hopes for our trip. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised by this experience.I made sure the front desk staff knew that our length of stay was unknown and they were happy to help us cut it short or extend it, as needed. When we needed to add extra days, we were given an even better rate than we originally checked in for.Every person I've dealt with at the hotel has been kind, accommodating, and friendly. I have felt taken care of and never felt anything other than efficient service. There are renovations going on that can be a bit noisy at times but the hotel is trying to make themselves better so I am happy to be understanding. Our room had recently been updated and the bed is super comfortable. There is a slight smoke smell, as this room must have been a smoking room once upon a time, but it hasn't been too oppressive. The only real thing that I wish had been different is that the hotel has a laundry room but does not sell laundry soap. I had to go to K-Mart and buy a bag of detergent, when I only needed to do one washing. If I could suggest any improvement, this would be.Overall, this stay has just been the best that it could have been for the circumstances we're here for. Even when a room isn't a 5-star room, good, friendly hotel staff go a long way in helping make the experience better. Thank you, Best Western!",1,0.537154882154882
116987508,"My daughter and I stayed here for a week of vacation.  We loved the Wilshire Crest.  Typically one can't find a reasonably priced hotel within walking distance of attractions but this place is just blocks away from museums, the Grove, the Farmers Market -- plus I could run in the early morning through its residential neighborhood and feel safe.  Best of all - free parking.  The one time we had trouble finding a spot I left my keys with the staff and they parked for me.  The room was clean and very big.  As other posters have noted, it does not have all the 'extras' of bigger hotels, but the staff provided everything that was missing.  The staff was always helpful.  The shower had excellent water pressure.  The beds were dressed with spotless white down comforters and half a dozen pillows.  Breakfast was very handy although heavy on the sugar - even the instant oatmeal was flavored with sugar.  To avoid sweets you'd have to stick to the plentiful (and fresh) bagels with trimmings.   Regarding security - there was somebody at the front desk 24 hours and I felt very secure there.  But if you are a person who is very nervous, know that the locks on the room doors are wobbly and the doors are not heavy and solid.  This was not an issue for me at all, but I know that for some people a solid door with a key card is vital for their comfort  The whole place was quiet but again, any noise from the hallway came right under and around the doors.  My only issue with the place had to do with the placement of my room just over the kitchen - I woke to the sound of  cupboards opening and closing every morning at breakfast time.  To avoid that just ask for a different room.  I can't say enough good things about the manager Aaron.  He communicated with me very promptly in advance of our trip, greeted us by name when we arrived, and provided a fruit basket on our second day.   We will definitely stay here again.",1,0.4556567460317461

It would have been nice if the rooms had refrigerators in them and also more room in the bathrooms. They also made us pay for Wi-Fi, parking and the Gym. I am thinking that some of this should have come with the Room, seeing that we paid a lot of money for it. What would have been great is if they included Continental Breakfast also. Just some of the things that would have been the icing on the cake.We were in the one story rooms/Bungelows. We loved the atmosphere. The flowers and chairs/benches/tables all over the place.The plants were green, lush and beautiful. The pools were awesome, they had three of them. The convention center was big and nice and modern.

That aside, the staff was excellent, attentive, and responsive (especially Ron and Drew).  This is not a box hotel.  It has history, charm, and is breathtaking... We were told that we were allowed to explore as long as a door was open.  It really did remind me a bit of the Winchester house.  It's easy to get lost so grab a map.  Explore the gardens.  Bring creamer and sugar for coffee if you like that.  There's none in the room.  It was quiet despite being booked.  We stayed on the first floor overlooking the pool and hot tub and the lighting outside was gorgeous.  They do have blackout curtains now.  Our room was small, but had a lot of character-- we just got a regular room, and will consider a suite or parlor room for our next visit.  As most people have stated, the beds are extremely comfortable and we slept and napped and slept again in between having the time of our lives.  The food is excellent.  There is a jogging, tennis, and a playground next door, and pool tables and a poker room downstairs.  The Silver Creek restaurant is often booked or closed, but they serve the same menu at the Lodge Grill.  Book ahead as this hotel is hard to get into at times.

The room was a good size and clean, there is a pleasant pool, bar and restaurant (although the air con is so cold in the bar area, we had to wear coats).  Little things were irritating like the drinks machine in our block being broken for our entire visit.

464498317,"This B&amp;B was inaugurated, I believe, 1 year ago, and it is ideal from all points of view to visit Pisa. It is in a nice 2-story small house with four guestrooms, bordering an inside garden and therefore absolutely quiet. The structure is charming, originally conceived as a theater for children close to an old church. There is a huge lounge with nice chairs to rest, read or work with a laptop, where breakfast is also served. The breakfast is generous, with Tuscany specialties and the possibility to get special items. The rooms are also nice, with a touch of antique. A collection of 6000 books with many high-quality texts is available for the guests. The B&amp;B is located at a short walking distance from the two Pisa landmarks, the Tower and Piazza dei Cavalieri. Still, it is far enough from the places flooded with tourist, so one can enjoy a real Tuscany atmosphere with many young people from the three universities. Last but not least, the personnel is extremely nice. Most of the operation is handled by a charming young lady called &quot;Beatrice&quot;, the name of Dante's love: one cannot ask a better combination in Tuscany!",1,0.6079081632653063
237455674,"Had it not been for the management - especially Chiara(?) - and location the rating would have been a 1.  Location is great if you need the train station as it's around a 3 minute flat walk (with heavy case) or quicker with just hand luggage.  Close to airport as well if you want to walk.  In hindsight I'd probably choose a different hotel and get a cab.  Nowhere in Pisa is that far from the airport/station for it to be expensive getting a cab.We couldn't have A/C as the 'temperatures drop to 10 degrees in the evening'. They probably did but it was unusually warm for October and it was early afternoon when we asked if it was possible to operate the air con.  So, for some coolish air we had to open the balcony door and shutters.  This resulted in an attack by the mossies! A lasting reminder, a week later, of our final night in Pisa.The room seemed to be clean from eye-level downwards but just don't look up! The extractor fan/vent was completely rusted over and served no purpose.  The shower cubicle, although clean inside, was rusty in areas and one of the doors had to be lifted across as the runners no longer worked. The toilet seat was badly cracked and was unstable.  You also need to be a contortionist or size 6 to get into the shower cubicle without also touching the basin and shower doors.There's no lift but not a major issue as there weren't too many stairs to contend with and Chiara did carry one of the cases to the room. The corridor lights don't come on as quickly as they should and there's a prevailing musty smell in the common areas though not in reception nor in the breakfast area.Speaking of breakfast. Again, not sure what to say.  Having read the reviews I didn't have high expectations so wasn't necessarily surprised.  The majority of it was pre-packaged, which I don't have an issue with, but even the wrapped croissants were stale.  The area for the yoghurts, for example, isn't chilled so be prepared for these to be warm unless you're lucky to get there when supplies have just been replenished.  The drinks are in thermal catering flasks and the coffee especially was awful. It wasn't just weak - it tasted vile.  As did the pineapple juice. The only horrible coffee I've had in Italy.  Luckily we overheard that cappuccinos could be requested from behind the bar and these were lovely.  There's little or no 'fresh' food but that's not a problem.  There's bread for toasting so grab some of that, a fresh cappuccino and that'll tide you over.They have a locked storage area for your luggage which is great and a toilet and shower area you can use after you've checked out - again, useful and appreciated.Overall, I guess my 'advice' for staying here is to use it as a well priced, well located and friendly place to stay for one night only and literally just use it for sleeping.Apologies to the owners for this review as you really were personable but I just feel you could turn this place into an absolute goldmine with a few changes and a little more attention to detail.  I'm honestly not fussy - all I want is somewhere clean and safe that I'd be happy to come back to and I'm afraid, at the moment, Hotel Moderno doesn't quite tick all the boxes.  The potential however is there and if the rooms, air con, cleanliness and breakfast were as good as the staff I'd have no hesitation in returning.",0,0.6061393596986816

Finally after 45 minutes of driving around I was able to reach someone who know how to reach the hotel. It was a botique hotel, small in size. To appologize for their mistake I was given an upgrade. Unfortunately, it was the noisiest room right next to an elevator. Due to construction even Uber wouldn't pick up at the hotel. The positive about the hotel - nice sheets and bathroom.

Handy underground car park around the corner and in walking distance to shops and restaurants in the city centre. I was so impressed on entering our room, which was an 'Elegance Suite'.... the photos don't do it justice, room was huge, so spacious, clean, modern &amp; had everything you could need. The bathroom was amazing - giant shower &amp; a separate bathtub with a TV over it, very luxurious. Only regret is that we couldn't stay for longer.

Pros:*wonderfully comfortable rooms*clean*attentive staff everywhere all the time*unbelievable pool, spa and fitness centre...better than some regular city facilities*always people around.  Usually at hotels, the hotel empties out during the day.  Here, people are always around making the hotel seem like the attraction (it's not,people are out hiking and biking and stuff but they always return to the hotel between activities)*lots of places to eat, the sandwich bar was really good and affordable.Cons*long distances to walk between rooms.  The corridor is almost 200 rooms long with the main reception elevators roughly in the middle.  So if you forget something in your room, it's a long trek back (I had the furthest room).  Ask for a more central room if you can*the Italian restaurant was a bit slow*didn't get hot water a couple times, wasn't sure if I didn't wait long enough but it wasn't a great hassle.

This was right on the front above the front door overlooking the busy shopping street.

If you don't have transportation of your own (as we did not since we were visiting from out of state)the hotel does offer transportation within a 5 mile radius which includes the casino and the airport. The airport is priority for the hotel so if there is an airport trip or pick up, the airport will take priority over the casino or the mall. The casino and airport are not walkable even though you can see the casino from the hotel window as there are no sidewalks all the way. The breakfast is complimentary and is better then we have seen in most hotels. We do advise you to go before 7:30 for the breakfast as it gets crowded down there. The walls are very thin and you can hear the people on the other side of the wall if they are loud. The people on the other side of us were loud until close to 6AM when they finally went to sleep.

What an awful experience! The basement stinks of mold or mildew, I bought air freshener, which didn't help. We kept the doors open as much as possible, which doesn't feel like the right thing to do in a hotel!  I had to move the fan to try to get some air circulating from the tiny windows, which are located right at the level of passerbyers feet. Every time someone stops to look at the hotel or take a photo, they stop in front of the window, which you have to leave open because of the smell, which is creepy enough when you just see their legs and feet, but even worse they bend down and try to peer into your room! Anyway, when the housekeeper cleaned the room, she just moved the fan back anyway. I couldn't bear to touch the nasty carpet with my bare feet, the room was decorated like a 1970s rec room, with exactly the kind of wooden bed I had as a kid, complete with the mattress with loud, squeky springs sticking into my back.  I barely slept the first night, partially because of the car headlights shining through the window every time a car drove by, but also because of the uncomfortable bed and the smell. The bathroom is ridiculously tiny: I am 4'10, and my boyfriend is 5'3, we could neither turn around confortably in the bathroom nor even sit on the toilet without the banging into the sink that hangs over you. The staff were very eccentric, I don't know if I would call them charming, like other reviewers. Moody yes, weird yes, but warm? Definitely not.

My only criticism relates to the bathroom - VERY small compared to most I've experienced in luxury hotels, and very out of proportion to the rest of the room itself.The food and service in the Club lounge are excellent, although it was not entirely peaceful as it was always pretty full, with quite a few young children present.  My only other criticism is the cost of beverages in the Lounge. Other similar facilities I've used in the past few months (incl. the Mandarin Oriental in Singapore &amp; The Langham in London) all provide wine, if not other drinks, for free.

He went way above and beyond and his high energy, his excellent English, and his sense of humour made our short stay memorable.  While the wonderful Bernadette served us a drink and a snack, he made us ferry and train reservations to get to Palermo, Sicily, made several phone calls to make sure everything would work, printed off all the tickets, arranged our evening with a family friend who was picking us up, and gave us information so we could make the most of our short visit to Reggio.  The room was sparkling clean, had a huge bed, a big en-suite with a great shower, and excellent Wi-Fi.

Breakfast which is included is great, all made to order from a limited but solid menu. I can't say enough about the hospitality, it was wonderful, the staff is super friendly.  Plus, you get to use the facilities of the more upscale sister hotel which is connected, so it really works out service wise.

I was not warned before coming that there would be some remodeling and this is what I would have to say was the only downfall. I was slightly worried because they were redoing the roof and wasn't looking forward to construction noise.  They did have the whole 3rd story shut down so there would be no one right below. The room I had on the 2nd floor was wonderful, but in coming back to my room later that night, it was covered in dust from the tearing down of the roof that came through the bathroom window (which I didn't know was opened, but I guess the maids do that). There was no way I could stay in that room, so they offered to UPGRADE me. They even physically showed me a few rooms to choose from. They ended up putting me in an ocean view balcony room for the inconvenience. I did not expect that, but I'm telling you THIS hotel is WONDERFUL!

Roomzzz is pretty much round the corner from the last place I stayed at, it was a few streets away from Oxford Road rail station, which is where we arrived. So its not hard to find.     The property is adjacent the Chinatown area, where you can see the Chinese gate up the street. Its a fantastic location to be. Straight roads lead you to good tourists spots. A straight walk from the entrance along Princes Street will take you to St Peters Square where you can catch a tram, see the Manchester Central Library or the Manchester town hall. Go a straight walk up Portland road and you can reach Piccadilly Gardens. There are plenty of pubs, bars, shops and attractions within a 15min walk in almost all directions, so its a cracking area to stay in.     1st impressions of the property were great, pretty modern. We were greeted at the front reception by smiles and helpful information, and actually arrived very early so we kept our bags there and headed out for some exploring. On return around 3ish we were able to go into our room.     The room was massive!, 'a Liberty Suite' is what we went for, plenty of storage space  around. Before we booked I wanted a room with alot more natural light, so this room we had was great. We had a view from the window, up Faulkner Street towards the Chinese Gate. The traffic wasn't a problem and we didn't have any disruptions any night (although we didn't stay over a weekend), and had a great sleep in very comfortable beds. There was plenty of amenities in the room, iron/iron board, rain shower, dishwasher, cutlery, kettle, microwave&amp; oven hobs, so you could buy things (from many nearby shops) and cook in your room if you prefer, although saying that, there is a small selection of snacks available on the ground floor to buy and coffee was free anytime at the coffee machine. The windows in the room were not able to be opened, but the air conditioning was brilliant for when it was to warm.     We did have a breakfast included but it wasn't like a usual hotel, you just head to the ground floor&amp; help yourself to pastries, coffee, milk, fruit etc. I only had cereal which was 50p, but I'm sure everything else was included in a breakfast price.We found this a great place to stay, and got it at a great price.

The b&amp;b is clean and comfortable but what makes it special is the warmth and kindness of Georgio. Nothing is too much trouble.

225042792,"Spent a few days at the newly renovated Chateau Frontenac.  Beautifully done, much brighter...However, the rooms are still small, and good luck trying to figure out the shower. No drawers to put clothes in, only a closet to hang up clothes.  The staff was friendly and courteous, good room service. No more stores in the basement to shop at, or even a convenient store for snacks and water. They want you to spend money on the minibar, or the vending machines, which aren't on every floor.  And now, it's a non smoking building.  And good luck trying to figure out the evacuation in case of a fire.  You need to be an engineer to figure out the map.  Lovely to walk outside and sit on the boardwalk with a Starbucks coffee...and tons of restaurants within walking distance.  A double decker bus is a great way to see the old Quebec, or take a horse and carriage ride.  We didn't eat in the restaurants at the Chateau, we preferred to eat at the restaurants outdoors, as it was perfect weather.   I would recommend the hotel to visitors, it is quite beautiful.

As in previous reviews, I agree that the rooms are in need of a renovation and small and the bathrooms even smaller but if all you want is a place to rest your head after a great day in the city then this is the place.  2 minutes from Pisa Centrale train station, 20 minute walk to the airport, 20 minute walk to the monuments.  Breakfast buffet was good, croissants, rolls, hard boiled eggs, cereals, yogurts, sweets, coffee and fruit juices.  Plenty was available for filling up on before heading out for the day.  The only thing I can complain about is the hardness of the beds.  Just a bit too hard for my liking but I guess they can't cater for everyone's taste.  Overall, I'd recommend this hotel.  A pleasant stay.  Thanks very much.",1,0.533921568627451
127680653,"The hardest part of writing this review is deciding what attribute of Serenity Ranch to rave about first. The term &quot;continental breakfast&quot; does not do justice to  Shane's food. Quite frankly the best croissants, the best quiche, the best yogurt, the best granola, exceptional berries, and smooth and tasty coffee make up what can only be termed a feast for your taste buds. We could not eat any more the rest of the day, and it was Easter Sunday! The previous day we relaxed in the Sun Porch with a good glass of wine (not to mention the refill), a cracker and cheese tray, and wonderful music as we read and snoozed and watched the sun go down. It seems that there is nothing too small for Shane to overlook when it comes to the comfort of his guests. Not only is your room fully stocked with every toiletry which you might have forgotten; a wide selection of snacks, coffee, tea and water; movies for the DVD player; and a bottle of wine to take home with you, but Shane has even rewritten, and gotten approved, the Fire Safety regulations the Government insists be posted in hotel rooms into language which the average person can understand. Ask Shane about the time he converted the old Gym into a beautifully decorated guest room in one weekend so that a Grandmother visiting from England would have a comfortable place to stay. Now that is service with a capital S. As dog lovers we adored Shelby, and we can assure you that she was the perfect lady at all times. It is not easy to win the title of &quot;Best&quot; a single time, especially in such a competitive field as the B&amp;B business, but Serenity Ranch deserves this accolade. Give yourself a treat you will talk about for some time to come. Book a room and enjoy the kind of old fashion hospitality you didn't think you could find any more.",1,0.563327859879584
121677971,"I stayed here for a week in early December for a snowboarding trip. The hotel has a perfect location - right next to the gondolas for both Whistler and Blackcombe mountains (1 minute walk) and is pretty much in the heart of the village too. The hotel staff were helpful and friendly. My room was spacious, clean and comfy. Everything worked well except the safe, which was a bit temperamental (and the hotel did offer to send someone up to fix it, which i declined in the end). My room also came with kitchenette that meant i was able to save money by cooking my own meals in the evening and preparing my own breakfasts (there's a good supermarket very near the hotel). The kitchenette provided all the equipment you need for cooking and eating. I paid $140 a night which seemed reasonable compared to the the other accommodation options available. In general, Whistler is a great resort with very friendly/helpful staff throughout the village and on the mountain. The terrain is fantastic, if quite steep, which is fine if there's new snow/powder, but a bit knackering when the snow's not so fresh.",1,0.5733441558441559

The front desk clerk was pleasant and helpful and checked us in quickly. The elevator system was a bit confusing at first as there's a few to choose from, but we got to our room. It was spacious and a bit older but nice and clean.We enjoyed the amenities even though we only stayed for one night! We used the hot tub (huge! Loved it!), pool, and sauna room which smelled nicely of eucalyptus. After returning to our room, we had some trouble with the water in the washroom getting hot so we called font desk and they sent up maintenance who came quickly and remedied the situation by letting the water run for about 2 minutes (felt bad for the waste) but he mentioned that since our room was at the end of the wing, sometimes water takes a bit to get there. We didn't have a problem with the water temperature the next morning.I woke up early and utilized their fitness centre which was surprisingly well stocked! There were fresh chilled towels and a water machine right in the fitness room. While there were plenty of options for breakfast at the nearby restaurants we opted to eat some cereal in our room (this was a break from camping) and they were kind enough to bring up some spoons with no complaints :) We then walked around the property as when we checked in they mentioned there was a walking path and holy moly....

Now that is customer service! She gave me a birthday bag of amenities which was a nice touch. The woman who was our server in the restaurant was also very nice. We ate very early in the morning (7 a.m.)  but she had a &quot;sunny&quot; personality and was very attentive as well.  Once again first-class service! The hotel room was very clean. It looked like it might have been recently remodeled. Everything was clean, airy (not stuffy) and orderly (plenty of towels and sundries). There was A/C in the room which was nice. We were on the 7th floor and I know the water has to travel a way to get up to our room but there was hot water for all the days we stayed in shower and sink. BIG ++!! Even though we faced the backside of hotel it was also very clean (landscape). We had view of trash compactor at the bottom, but that area was clean and well maintained. There is valet and self-parking. We used guest self-parking; it is pricey ($23 per night stay) but I think very well worth it. It is only accessible with your room key and it is under the hotel on 2-3 levels.  There is an underground entrance via elevator up to the lobby. I did feel secure when going to and from my car. Plenty of lighting and directions. There is also guest self-laundry facilities and gym. I did not use these, but I did look inside all clean and orderly. I did have to use the business center. It is not really a room but just 2 computers with printer available for guest use located around the corner from the front desk in a hallway, which is not really private. But the internet is quick, and I was able to print the information that I needed. My only suggestion would be just to find a more private location for the computers to be like a room instead of a hallway. Those are just a couple of the things that stood out.

515275840,"We chose this hotel for its long standing good reviews for a special family meal.  There were eight of us.  Had a pre dinner drink in the bar which was lovely and pretty chic.When we were shown to out table it looked quite bare i.e. no tablecloth or mats and very thin paper serviettes that fell apart on touching. Due to the bare floors within the restaurant there was nothing to absorb the noise therefore it was very difficult to hear people at the table. Starters arrived almost immediately following our order however I had the haggis tower which was not very warm and the glayva sauce was not great.  I was more concerned how quickly the mussel's were served and again were not piping hot.  One member of our party is diagnosed with celiac and given this establishment I was surprised to find they did not particularly cater for this e.g. no bread available.  Offered them melon for a starter as they knew that would be ok!!!After approximately one hour our main course had not been served and this was questioned by one of our party.  the response was 'its the kitchen's fault'.Main courses eventually arrived and they were certainly nothing to write home about.  Steak was mediocre, steak burger was not eaten, pork stroganoff sauce was extremely gloopy and had been under a heat lamp causing a gel film around the edge of the plate, sea bass was beautiful but served on an abundance of noodles.Staff managed to serve the bottles of wine readily however one member of our party requested a whisky and dry and this took three attempt to achieve.The service was really poor however they appeared to be really short staffed.  Given how busy the place was they must be receiving a good income and could certainly afford to pay for more staff to meet the needs.This was my first visit here and I could not recommend this place nor would it ever be on my list to return.Felt really sorry for our family member who organised this and was paying for it.

134434639,"Comparable to the best accommodation of any kind from resort hotels to B and B's .It is a dream.  The quality  and design of the room and bath is of the highest standard.  Every modern convenience is provided from Frette sheets,large rain shower,superb lighting ,fine toiletries,comfortable bed and sitting area,tea service in room...the stunning details abound.Giuseppe, young, vibrant and friendly host and owner, made this experience even more special.  He is understandably proud of the B and B and wants his guests to have the best experience possible. We never felt so cared for in any other accommodation...from offering to meet and escort us to the city and convenient parking, carrying our luggage, offering us coffee and cakes ( fresh and always available in the well- appointed lobby) and explaining  every detail of our fabulous room.  He asked us what type of dinner we prefer and then escorted us to a nearby reasonable yet exceptional restaurant.  In the evening, he knocked on our door to bring us ice cream because he thought we might enjoy some!  In the morning, he walked us to the breakfast cafe ( again included) where we were offered anything we wanted.  When I expressed an interest  in some fruit Giuseppe went to the market and bought two huge baskets for us because it was unavailable in the bar itself.  He introduced us to the cafe owner and sat and chatted with us during breakfast.When it was time to leave for Messina, he escorted us to the ferry on his motorbike, arranged for the purchase of tickets etc. He told us to call him ( he is always at the B and B) if we experienced any difficulties in our travels and he would help.We felt that in Giuseppe not only did we find the most attentive and concerned of hosts but also a friend...one that is charming and fun to be with.  We were so comfortable  in his presence.Lastly, we were pleasantly surprised that Reggio Di Calabria is such a beautiful city...lovely wide promenades along the sea, a pedestrian area a few blocks inland...all at the doorstep of TownHouse Cavour...a perfect location.  The evening passeggiata was the most authentic ( few tourists like us!) we had in Italy.Our only regret is that we only had one night.  We would have definitely stayed longer...both to linger in the fabulous B and B and to enjoy the city more. We hope to return to Reggio but only if we can stay at TownHouse Cavour.

561307057,"My adult daughter and I just returned from our first trip to Quebec City and had a great time!  A big part of that was staying at such a nice hotel as the Auberge Saint-Antoine.  I was the trip planner and really didn't have any idea of an agenda and my daughter wanted to see it all plus enjoy all the festivities that Winter Carnavale had to offer.  The head concierge Genevieve could not have been any nicer or helpful to us.  Her associate Francois was also very accommodating and helpful too.  Besides supplying all kinds of information on restaurants and activities they arranged a couple of tours for us and a driver from Limousine A1 to pick us up at the airport.  A little more expensive than a cab but lovely to have that personalized service!  I believe the driver's name is Michel and he was very nice and informative and even pulled over to show us some sights.I chose the hotel basically because of the positive Trip Advisor reviews and we were not disappointed.  Our room and the bathroom were both nicely sized and very well appointed and comfortable.  We, of course, loved the heated bathroom floor!  We got there fairly late in the evening so we ate at the Artefact Bar.  The menu seemed a bit limited but it is a bar so I guess that's to be expected and the service was a little hit or miss.  Seemed like maybe they were starting to close up for the night so that might have been the issue.  The bar itself though was very nicely decorated and comfortable with two little side rooms with fireplaces, very nice!One morning we had an early tour so we ordered a room service breakfast the night before and it was right on time and a great start to our day!  We also ate at Chez Muffy and that was a great experience.  All the staff were very attentive and we both splurged and got the Tasting Menu with the addition of the wine tasting menu and had a wonderful, delicious meal in a beautiful setting!The day before we left one of the receptionists kindly arranged a cab to pick us up in the morning.  When we got off the elevator at 8:00 am there to greet us was a man who asked our room number to identify us and then whisked our bags away. I checked out and the same pleasant man then took us and put us in the cab.  My daughter and I weren't paying good attention so it was actually after the door on the cab closed that we realized it wasn't our driver who had been so attentive to us it was the bell man!  We both felt bad because we really didn't thank him properly.

I pressed the issue so they did end up charging my card as I wished. I could see though, with someone who wasn't going to put up a fuss that they would take advantage of that. I understand some places not accepting cards, but then don't say that you do, quite clearly, in the fine print on the website and booking confirmations. Finally, I had booked 2 nights and after the first night, they emailed say they needed me to change rooms for some mistake they had made -- putting me in a room on a floor that then they needed for a whole family.

Within that area there is a lot to do and see and many fine shops and restaurants. The room was large and the bed was comfortable.  The car park was very convenient and easy to access.  There was a lot of hanging space and comfortable chairs and unlike some Holiday Inns the tea and coffee supplies were topped up in the room every day.  The negatives.

There was a lot of open area in the room and the bathroom could have been bigger.  Hot water took a long time to flow through (5th floor room).

My room was very very tiny. It looked like a housekeeper's room.  When I opened my suitcase, there was no space to stand anymore. That room was so noisy because the other side was kitchen entrance. My view from the window  was employee's motorcycle. It was very noisy early in  the morning and at night.At night when I went to sleep, I noticed that the bed made terrible noise when I moved. Very bad and poor bed! The worst thing was, whenever someone use the water, I hear terrible noise..water's running. I do not know why, but my room was in the first  floor and if someone lived upstairs use water, the noise always came..many times during that night. So I could not sleep very well and I was very tired in the morning. when I went to have a breakfast, no staff paid attention to me, although it said that 'wait until the staff comes and gives you a table'. I waited maybe more than ten minutes standing in front of breakfast room. I could not wait any longer, so I took a free table and sit down.

For starters, the staff from the front desk, valet to maintenance members were genuinely friendly and very helpful. You can tell that they really enjoy working there and with each other. The lobby is so creatively designed. I loved our room - it was clean, cute, and comfortable. We had the room with a little Hawaiian theme case. It was a good sign, because I was born and raised in Hawaii. The bathroom was so roomy-LOVE THE SHOWER! The huge mirror with the coat hooks was awesome! The sitting bench was roomy and a space safer. OMG after our long days, we slept like babies in our soft comfy bed. The room was creatively and smartly designed with lots of simple space saving ideas and necessities which made it the perfect room. As for the rest of the hotel, it was an awesome getaway spot. There was a second nice floor lounging mezzanine, which had morning yoga. There was a nice outdoor pool with a small recreation room with a ping-pong table. There was a nice bar and eatery Tart with an awesome outdoor dining space these two areas were open to non-hotel guests too. But my all time FAVORITE AREA on the hotel grounds, were the HOTEL GUEST CABANAS! Classy, comfy and fun to relax on as we enjoyed meals and drinks under the beautiful LA sky.

Where to start... the room was just simply dirty and if the material quality of our room was representative of the current state of the other rooms, they really need to renovate this place. The attached pictures and their captions speak for themselves... Sure, they took $50 off my bill, but I would have rather paid full price and had a better experience... If I was looking to save money by staying in a run-down room, I would have booked a night at the local motel 6 so I wouldn't have to haggle with the front desk for a credit to my bill at checkout to match the service I received at this specific Sheraton. The best part, by far was that this room was marked as a SPG room... seriously?",-1,0.4575396825396825
178776748,"I was unfortunate enough to have to stay here for a week for a conference.  I had read the reviews and wasn't too scared, but saw the majority spoke of it needing to be upgraded.  When I arrived I was placed in the &quot;bungalow&quot; room.  These rooms are real nice, (SARCASM).  I was met by a room designed in the 60's, and obviously not updated.  The room was visibly dirty and I compare to a Motel 6.  The bathroom had as many cockroaches as towels (that is 6 by the way).  Even better was the drain in the tub/shower.  It was cool that you can take a bath and shower at the same time, since the drain doesn't go fast enough, I ended up with 6&quot;  water in the tub by the time I was done with the shower.  If that wasn't exciting, the 20&quot; TV in the chest cabinet will put you over!Then there was the conference.  The chairs were probably purchased when they built the resort. Not a problem if you have a good chiropractor.  The service was poor and WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT HAVE THEM CATER YOUR EVENT!!!!!!  Our event was catered, I got the NY Steak, it was like leather.  Horrible.Restaurants: Not even gonna go there.  Ate at their &quot;sports bar&quot; it was a joke. Burger the staff called a 1/2 lb., really a frozen 1/3 lb patty.  THe formal dining room was overpriced and NOT worth the $$.I have never stayed at this motel before ( I call it a motel because it is NOT a resort), and  never will.  The ONLY good part of my stay was the front desk staff.  They and the bell/concierge were AWESOME! The funny part was a couple of the staff who agreed with EVERYTHING i wrote here.  They told me the &quot;resort&quot; has resorted to min wage employees to do about everything here.  Cook, bartend, etc.  Having stayed in hundreds of motels/hotels/resorts; If given the choice of a Motel 6 and this,,,,I'm gonna go to the 6.

160282171,"Ironically, this hotel was the one that I'd hoped I wouldn't get when bidding on Priceline.  First, the staff member who checked me in was very prompt and courteous.  I was surprised how few people were staying at this property when I checked in.  The parking lot was almost empty, so I was a bit put off by the fact that there is a fee for parking.  If you're a hotel guest, the rate is reasonable.  I realized that because this hotel does such a big convention and special events business, parking is probably a big source of revenue.  The weekend evenings found the large parking lot to be packed.  However, I always was able to find a parking space not far from the elevator.I found my room to be immaculate.   The furnishings were very traditional; a four poster king bed was very comfortable.  It isn't a &quot;W&quot; hotel, but then I wasn't paying a premium price for a tiny, minimalist furnished room.  The bathroom was dated, but very clean and the towels were plentiful and thick.  I had a nice room centered over the main pool.  There is nice landscaping around the pool areas.  Room service was good except for my tray from the previous evening still being outside my door when I returned at 7:00 pm.I was tired the first evening, having dealt with commute traffic getting to San Diego.  I decided to just order room service.  I found the food at the hotel to be mediocre and expensive.  There are a lot of other options, even if it's walking over to restaurants at Fashion Valley Mall.Noise was a negative factor.  They rent out the grounds for special events, weddings, etc.  The Friday I stayed there, there was an event with music blaring up from the pool area.  It was REALLY loud.  I shut not only my balcony door and the draperies, but I could still hear the noise.  I called the front desk to notify them about the room service tray and inquire about the volume of the music and was told that the music might continue 'til 9pm.  The woman with whom I spoke said there had been a lot of complaints.  So, clearly, the hotel doesn't really seem to care about this issue.  Luckily, the music volume seemed to decrease shortly after I made the call, about 7:30.  There was a wedding the following evening, with more loud music, although not quite as loud, and it didn't seem to go on for long.  I also noticed that I could hear the conversation of the people next door through the door in the room that would make this a suite if it were open.  I'd suggest putting a towel down at the base of the door if you don't want to hear others or you don't want them to hear you.The location was actually a big plus for this hotel.  There is a foot bridge from the parking lot over a stream to Fashion Valley Mall and a transit center.  You can get a bus or the tram, or if you're looking to shop, Fashion Valley has a huge selection of good stores and eating venues.Driving wise, it's just off the 163,8, and close to the 5.  The tram allows you to get to lots of points in San Diego without having to drive.I would definitely stay at this property again and would recommend it; however, I think that I'd tend to do so during the week, and maybe avoid the weekends, what with weddings and other special events being booked on the property.",1,0.5472741702741704

When the Mid-Wilshire metro station opens, this location will be even more compelling.As to the hotel: a mob of us stayed here for a family wedding.  The front desk staff was wonderful and always helpful, and gave the wedding couple a free upgrade to a huge suite.  However, housekeeping seems to be short-staffed.  Rooms weren't ready by check-in time, early check-in over several days only possible once, and daily cleaning wasn't done until later in the afternoon.  The rooms varied:  ask for a room facing the street or the back.  Ours was a suite, but faced north &amp; looked out on concrete walls, which resulted in poor cell reception, and may have contributed to lousy wifi in the bedroom.  Other rooms had better light and good reception.  The upgraded suite was fabulous and made the pre-wedding prep a party.

It took the staff over an hour and half to come look at my suite. I looked in to the hall and saw the cleaning service in a room down the hall.  I went to front desk to ask if someone was going to come clean my room and relocate me. The receptionist rudely told me to go to my room and wait. When someone finally came they looked and left and didnât clean-up. I asked for another suite the Sales Manager (only manager on site) said I would have to downsize my room and still pay the same price as no other similar room types available. Hours later cleaning service arrived and I walked in a said, &quot; YOU ARE Still Here!&quot; A morning of several rude employees. In the end I was provided another room but missed the game I came to see. They didnât compensate my stay for all the inconvenience and rude staff.  Very rude staff at this location and overpriced rooms for the poor quality rooms. I wonât stay here, again and will not recommend the Best Western Brantford Hotel  to anyone.",-1,0.3778703703703703
4153054,"I stayed at this hotel after booking it as a surprise for an anniversary present.  My boyfriend and I are both from LA, but just wanted a change of pace for our anniversary weekend.  I used to live in the area and always remembered how they had revamped the hotel in recent years.  I loved the name (its always stuck out in my head) and jumped on the opportunity to finally spend a night there!  One of my favorites about this hotel is the location--across the street from the tasty delights at the Farmer's Market!  It was a great treat to wake up and walk over to our favorite crepe stand in the market!  It truly was a boutique experience!  The hotel itself was clean, fairly modern, and completely cutesy.  I was surprised to find a stereo in the room and found the houty-touty LA magazines that were provided great fun!  The rocking recliner and portraits of cows and hens were a nice touch!  Everything in the hotel is nicely branded as the Farmer's Daughter silhouette could be found everywhere--from the front of the hotel to the notepads in the rooms to the copper elevator interior.  The weird part was our bathroom--it was completely plain white, non-descript and didn't have any farmer/country/color theme to it at all (unlike the rest of the hotel.)  It seemed a bit unfinished, but it was clean otherwise.  After reading reviews where people complained about noise, I was worried.  But I have to say it was really really quiet when the windows and doors were closed.  My one concern was the reservation system.  I had asked for a room that would accommodate a dog when I made the reservation.  The woman at the reservation service (a separate service from the actual hotel) told me that it was no problem and that I would just have to tell the front desk.  Luckily I confirmed my reservation a few days later just to make sure everything would go smoothly.  UNFORTUNATELY, the hotel told me that they only have two rooms that are pet friendly and those are generally booked up way in advance.  I was then forced to find a sitter for my boyfriend's dog.  It kind of put a kink in my original plans, but was my only gripe with the hotel.  I imagine that the main issue is the disconnect with a generic reservation service and the hotel staff.Other than that, I would go back to the Farmer's Daughter!",1,0.5398078529657476

291085276,"We booked 3 rooms at this hotel, we specifically requested the &quot;renovated&quot; rooms.  My son's family arrived right at 3:00pm.  He told the desk that we would be late, but he secured the other rooms with a credit card.  He requested a refrigerator because he had milk and medicine that need refrigeration.  It took 4 hours and two visits to the lobby and multiple phone calls to the desk for the refrigerator to be delivered.  At least the ice machine worked.  When we arrived about 12:30 am, we were told that our rooms in the &quot;renovated&quot; tower had been given away and that we were being given rooms in an annex.  When we arrived at the &quot;annex&quot; I was horrified.  One elevator did not work and the other was so small only two people could use it at a time.  It creaked dreadfully.  If we were not on an upper floor, I would have carried my luggage up the stairs.  The facility was &quot;shabby&quot;.  We arrived at our rooms about 1:00 in the morning.  I went to my room and the key did not work.  I checked the key envelope where the clerk wrote the room number and it was correct.  I called the desk and was told a bell man was on the way with a new key.  I sat in the hallway for about 20 minutes waiting and then called the front desk again.  The clerk  said that she could not find my room.  I am still not sure what that meant.  She then told me that I was actually in a different room.  I told her that I was at the room number written on my envelope and she got very snitty and said that it was the wrong room.  When we finally got in the room, the carpet was so stained I hated walking on it and the bathroom had mold in the shower.  The wallpaper was torn in multiple locations.  The desk called at 9 in the morning and offered us a room in the &quot;renovated&quot; tower.  The bell man was very timely and very nice.  The bright spot in this saga.  We moved rooms and found the &quot;renovated&quot; rooms were just as bad as the previous room.  Huge stains covering the carpet and mold in the bathroom shower.  The wallpaper was the same but it was not torn.  I needed water to take my medicine and remembered that the vending machine outside was being loaded as we walked by so I went to get some water.  I put my money in and a rigid plastic piece blocked the bottle so I could not get it out.  I called the desk and was told to come to the office, which was in another building, and they would refund my money.  I told them I needed the water and they said they would send someone to fix the machine.   No one came for quite awhile.  A maintenance man walked down the hallway so I asked him to try for me, he could not help.  He did lean over the rail and yell at the machine guy to come fix it.  Then the maid stopped by and said it had been broken for a week.  In the mean time I visited every floor and finally found a machine that worked on the 8th floor.  I went back to my room and about an hour later the maid came to get me to say that the machine guy was there.  He gave me a bottle of water and fixed the machine.  I told him that the machines on the other floors were not working either but he did not seem to care.  My daughter and her husband moved to the Marriott at the Marina after the first night and paid very little more.  They were on business and so would be in the hotel for the entire week.   I would have followed but I only had one more night and did not want to move again.  In retrospect, my son and I should have moved as well.",-1,0.5371442833652135

There were the usual amenities there -- a wafflecloth robe, a good coffee set-up, top-tier toiletries. The muted colors, the sleekness of it -- after a busy day, those felt like an ah.

The room we stayed at in the mansion was really small - I think the rooms not overlooking the pool tend to be smaller. The hotel offers a shuttle which would be great for those who can't/don't want to drive, especially since the hotel is slightly outside of San Jose, not right in the thick of things (but there are ups and downs to that - it was quieter and secluded which of course was nice).

It's a once in a lifetime for those of us who only visit.

The Farmer's Daughter came up, and as it is directly across the street from the Farmer's Market, I thought it was worth a try. It is a bit pricey for my budget, but we only needed one night, being in driving distance from Los Angeles. I booked through an on-line website, so our first encounter was with the valet parking attendants. They responded to our arrival immediately, gettting us oriented, and advising the desk of our arrival. The hotel only has valet parking, which I am not fond of, but it was well handled, so no complaint there. It IS an extra $20, but it was listed on the hotel website, so it wasn't a surprise. The front desk person was very friendly, and took care of us quickly, answering our questions, and getting us set up. The big basket of free cookies was a nice touch. There is a nice restaurant connected to the lobby, but we did not eat there. They did get us some sodas to go, though it was pricey....and probably why there is no vending machine in the hotel.....The place is a bit different than most, which we like. It was very clean, evident by the super shiny wooden floors in and out of the rooms.....the balcony walkways were spotless, instead of the usual dirty concrete. We didn't mind the bare floors in the room, they were also spotless. We aren't fond of carpeting at home either, so it was fine. The room was pretty standard, just a bit different in decorating. It had basic amenities - TV, fridge, safe....the DVD player was a nice touch, though we didn't use it. We couldn't figure out the TV, but a call to the desk had a maintenance person come up within ten minutes to show us how to work the remote. Our only complaint was that the tub was clogged up, and didn't drain while being used.....not a major thing. On a positive note, the bed was very comfortable, and there were extra pillows. The morning desk attendant was just as friendly and helpful during checkout.So with only one night, we didn't test them thoroughly, but our stay was generally very good.",1,0.512450110864745

We've stayed in a number of B&amp;B's and the one thing that always brings us back is the higher &quot;personal touch&quot; that B&amp;B owners typically provide. We didn't get that feel at Leaside Manor...it's run more like a business (as opposed to someone sharing their home with us). A few other things:1. The gravel parking lot is quite small making it tough for people with large vehicles (such as us), especially if you're one of the last ones to come &quot;home&quot;. One night, we must've spent a good 15 minutes trying to shoehorn into the last remaining spot.2. Despite its marketing that states that Leaside Manor is &quot;near downtown&quot;, it's not really walking distance...unless you want a good hike. Make sure you have a vehicle.3. The building itself is gorgeous. It's a wonderfully kept-up heritage property with beautiful dining room, foyer, parlour, gardens, etc. Definitely can't beat the ambience.Leaside Manor isn't the cheapest place in St. John's but, for what you get (and compared to the going rates in the city), it's a decent value...at least on weekdays. The significantly higher weekend prices are a bit of a stretch, at least for our budget.

We had been in transit for 23 hours and were pretty keen to get checked in, but - no problem - we got acquainted with the neighbourhood for 20 minutes.When we returned, the guy at the counter didn't seem to have done anything further. We felt a little bad for him - he was clearly run off his feet with phone calls and other guests - but I feel the hotel could focus a bit more on the check-in process, given it's a first impression.Anyway, they honoured the booking, so that was OK in the end, but I did receive a call from another woman at the hotel asking for the same booking details we'd already given the guy at the counter in the printout of our booking confirmation. A little frustrating. They didn't seem able to help with much, really - I asked for a recommendation of somewhere nearby to get Mexican food, and the two staff members looked at each other blankly before offering a book of local restaurant menus. Not sure if I was expecting too much there, but this is LA and it's Mexican food - how hard can it be to name a place?So, the rooms are nice enough - we stayed in a King Guestroom. Bathroom is nice and large with a rainfall showerhead. Everything's clean and modern; comfortable beds and linens.The location is good as long as you have a car, which we did, but I'd probably suggest staying a few blocks north otherwise, assuming you want to do some of the touristy stuff.

On this trip we did not bring our dogs, because we wanted to see what the place was like without the distraction. We would definitely go back.The room was a decent size and faced the marsh and dog beach beyond. Our second-floor room had a deck that is big enough so you can go out and enjoy a drink and look at the view. Just a wonderful place to relax. First floor units have patios, but I'm betting that most of them have only a decent ground-level view of the marsh and sand -- nothing like what you get on the second floor.The beds were older and kind of soft, but afforded us a decent night's sleep. The room contained a fridge which (unlike the refrigerator in any other hotel room we have been in) blasted us with cold air when we opened it. The bathroom was well-kept, but the shower walls needed a good scrub-down. Also, the ventilating fan in our bathroom did not work. I mentioned it to the desk clear when we left, and she said they would get right on it.Speaking of the desk clerk, they were friendly and helpful. There is a small pool outside the office.

There are no stairs to choose as an alternative. On our second stay one was also out of action the whole weekend.    Another elevator servicing some higher floors accessible via stairs and a long walk along the mezzanine floor is not convenient and certainly not with luggage. Some serious elevator upgrading is needed.  In house cafe/bar is small and not flash but provides good breakfasts and evening meals if you do not wish to dine out.  We were happy to dine in all nights.  Coffee average but plenty of cafes nearby including Starbucks opposite. Hotel located on edge of main CBD with Hop on Hop Off bus stop opposite and tour bus pickups at hotel.  15 minute casual walk to the waterfront, cruise terminal ($15 taxi to ships), and then waterfront walk, views.  A good half days slow walk doing a full circuit around the cbd and adjoining city living area.

Rooms are spacious with comfortable bedding, small refrigerators and there is a nice courtyard with pingpong.  Our family had several rooms and it worked out very well for all.  The bathrooms had been renovated, and some of us had flat screen TVs.  Wifi worked.  Parking on site.  Basic diner type restaurant on site for breakfast and lunch.  There were some quirks - primarily that they use an old-fashioned system for the reservations.  You cannot reserve online, phone and email reservations took a long time (for three rooms with different people arriving different times) and we found it hard to make changes.  (The rooms were available, but their system made it complicated to change anything.)  Also, late arrival was a problem because the desk closes at 11.  We appreciated their accommodations for this.  One family member arriving late had to step over someone sleeping on the floor!   One downside is that the neighborhood does not have close-by shops and restaurants.  However, there is a bus right outside the door that goes down Geary, so you can get everywhere in SF easily without battling the traffic. But... if you don't expect the Hilton, do stay there.

The structure and the inside of the hotel is about 40 years old.We booked a triple room. When we arrived the room we got was much smaller than what advertised. The bathroom was filthy, hairs everywhere. The towels were of a grey-ish color and smelled bad. We promptly requested another room and were given a room that, in the words of the manager of the hotel, is &quot;one of the best in the hotel&quot;. Again, the room was dirty across the board: bed linens, bathroom, bathtub, windows, curtains... the list goes on. In addition there is no sound insulation of any kind.

Our room (although it had a balcony) was small, dark and in need of painting.  The food in the restaurant was ok, and although we were half board, we ended up going out most nights for dinner.  Having said that the manager of the restaurant was v. observant, and asked us whether it would suit us better to have lunch in the hotel rather than dinner, which impressed us!The hotel however does have a large swimming pool, its usually easy to get a lounger and it is located adjacent to a gorgeous sandy beach with fab waves.  Deck chairs are available free on the beach to hotel residents, however loungers cost â¬7 per day.Pisa is only 1/2 hour away  by bus and Florence another hour by train from there, so there is plenty to do, and the train service is very reliable.

Knowing that this place would be packed for the conference, I made a reservation 2 months ahead, thinking that I could get a better room.  When I made the reservation, I reserved a room in the Royal Palm Tower, which is supposed to be the biggest room with two quenn bed, nice view, and a balcony.  However, when I got there, although the front desk told me that I had a two-quenn bed room, when I got to my unit, I found it in a complex (not the tower that I reserved) under a stair case, no view, with two double-beds instead.  The beds were not comfortable to sleep on.  Since the place was packed with two conferences going on at the same time, I did not ask for a different room, which was a mistake.  In addition, the hot water boiler was way over the other side and it took forever just to have loop warm water.When we checked out, I mentioned to the front desk and was told that there was nothing they could do and that queen beds were available &quot;on requests only&quot;, which I thought I did.  It's not like I was asking for compensation or anything.  A heartful apology from the manager would've done it.In addition, this place did not have enough parking space to hold two conferences at the same time and we were having hard time finding parking space after we went out for lunch.The last day of the stay, we went to one of their restaurant there to get a bite before I had to go and do my presentation.  The place was full of people but only with one waitress.  We had to ask three times and it took 20 minutes before the second waitress finally showed up.  By the time the food got to our table, I had to leave for my presentation.

The current owner and general manager have been able to establish the Inn as a top destination in the community. The grounds are lovely - not just because of the oceanfront views - but also because of the gardens on-site....roses everywhere!My husband and I recently had an October wedding at the hotel with 100 of our closest family and friends.  Despite our best efforts for planning, we had no idea just how magical the actual event would be.  The sweeping views from La Jolla to Mexico - including the OB Pier - were met by over the top care and consideration taken by the hotel staff.  Not only did my husband and I feel extremely well looked after over the course of our 3 day event, but were told by our friends and family repeatedly that they also felt welcome and well looked after.  What the Inn is lacking in what you might experience from a chain or big box hotel, they more than make up for with the amazing views.  Breathtaking and spectacular.  Having an event here will make your guests feel transported.  Even friends and family from SD that chose to stay at the Inn for the event were overwhelmed by the views and location.Thanks to Gavin and his crew for helping us to put our dream wedding and celebration together.",1,0.6236111111111111

The room did not have air conditioning (I was advised when I checked in) and was warm upon arrival.  I opened a window, put the fan near the window to draw in cooler air, and turned on the ceiling fan and when I came back after a walk the room had cooled considerably.  No issue sleeping at night.I did go to the gym and it is reasonable, a few free weights, couple of weight machines, ecliptical, tread mills, and an indoor/outdoor hot tub and an indoor swimming pool.I was there for a group function, so did not eat in one of the restaurants but had a buffet and the food was very good, loved the shrimp tacos.My departure was excellent, smooth, quick, and very friendly.Beautiful hotel to stay at if you enjoy the outdoors with hiking and beautiful walking trails on site.

After you get the food you are ignored. The food is subpar and expensive including the hotel catering.  Internet bandwith is so bad it makes the internet useless and it will only cost you 10 bucks a day for that. The hotel must beleive in hiring people who will do the jobs americans won't do.

Lots of free cookies at reception though.Location:  Very good location to the slopes, the driving range and just about everything else.Facilities: The hotel is modern and spacious.  It has numerous meeting facilities, a tennis court, inner courtyard, an outdoor pool (small), a spa, a bar and restaurant, internet/business facilities in the basement.  It also has a self serve laundry facility near the elevator on all floors.  Curious it only has two small elevators for the number of rooms.  There is a hotel shuttle that can take you on some small errands.  I used it once to deliver a package to mail for business reasons.Rooms:  Very spacious.  Ours had a large, large closet (for ski stuff and luggage).  There is a real fire place supplied with logs, a full size fridge, stove, dishwasher, dishes, cups, granite counter tops and a breakfast bar (no dining table).  The room had the bed in the room with a couch and coffee table.  The bathroom was clean and modern.  Dining:  We dined in once and found the staff friendly and good with children (the food was a little pricy but it is so everywhere and not out of line).Manager:  Tim (don't know his last name) made every effort to greet guests (always seemed to be on duty) and even had a reception.  The only incident marring our experience was during a warm spell (in July), there was a lot of people at the pool, but not enough furniture.  There were two ladies who said they worked at the Hilton kitchen who had removed our gear from the chairs (one was clearly a child's possessions) and said the spots belonged to them since they were here all day.

The waiters were busy setting tables and moving things around and didnât look across to the station where guests are asked to wait to be seated. After a few minutes I was shown to a table. I served myself with cereal from the buffet but had to call a server to request coffee and my cooked breakfast order. She was very apologetic. When the breakfast arrived eventually, it was freshly cooked and not from a pass, with the mushroom and black pudding piping hot. I noticed other guests were ignored whilst waiting to be seated. Compared to a recent experience on a Cunard cruise ship, the service was really poor, being inattentive and not particularly warm or welcoming. The level of staffing was also low, which compounded the cheerless service (or maybe caused it!).Passing back through reception to my room, there was a lengthy queue waiting to be checked out by the lone receptionist. So in summary, if you like nice decor then this hotel may be worth considering.

The hotel itself has a boutique feel, with an unusual museum-style decor. Innumerable artefacts dug up during construction are on display around the lobby and even in the guest rooms themselves. Crockery, shoes, cannon balls, glassware...it's beautiful and fascinating. The breakfast options at the on-site restaurant are diverse and well-made, as are the brunch choices in the lobby cafe. The restaurant does dinner but you'll need to book ahead (we didn't get a spot) as it's one of the top restaurants in town. The staff was excellent. Service was thorough all the way through, even down to the gourmet homemade cookies given as a check-out gift.The rooms are clean and beautiful. We had a terrace room, with a lovely view of surrounding buildings and two enormous armchairs. The minibar was the most impressively stocked I've seen, and came with a card of cocktail recipes.

It was a thoroughly enjoyable walk and at a snails pace it took us no longer than 30 minutes to reach the tower. Back to the hotel itself. On checking into our room we noticed that the light in the corridor did not work and it was very dark, the two pin plugs in the room(No 305) were either used for the TV/fridge or positioned in such a way that when the adaptor was inserted you could then not insert the three pinned plug (not a problem for those outside the UK!) and the shower curtain base was quite grubby. I immediately went to the front desk and spoke to the receptionist, Andreas who was absolutely charming, he explained that he would look into the matters and do whatever he could. Within 15 minutes he was knocking at our door and pointed out that he had changed the bulb in the corridor although he could do nothing about the shower curtain and moving rooms was not an option as the hotel was full. He did point out that there was a socket in the bathroom that we could use. He also gave us a complimentary bottle of prosecco for our troubles. The shower cubicle was very small and because the shower curtain was about a foot too long it kept blocking the drain and causing the bathroom to flood although we mopped this up with the thin towels( unlike some other comments we also had two very large and fluffy bath towels). The breakfast was adequate and fresh. The only comment I would make here is that there is only one person on duty and she acts as the receptionist/controller of the cleaners and the person who replenishes the orange juice/coffee etc so if she is checking someone out of the hotel and the coffee runs out you have to wait and this happened often! Consider employing someone for a couple of hours in the morning just to ensure that stock levels are maintained. None of the above are meant to be complaints just observations and matter of facts. On the positive side in addition to the location the furniture in the room was of a high standard and the bed was large and very comfortable. The room was also spotlessly clean.Although we stayed for three nights you could comfortably see the sights on a two night stay. We spent the extra day taking the train to Florence which is well worth doing.",1,0.5098252560447684
146139044,"Gli Arlecchini is more like staying at your Gran's house than staying at a B&amp;B - lots and lots of very homely touches. Clean and adequate as a city base and very conveniently situated (within walking distance) for the train station, connection to the airport and the leaning tower.But the best thing of all is the breakfast. Everyone sits together in a small parlour-like room and there is enough food supplied to keep you going all day. The whole table is piled with food which is plentiful, varied and sure to suit everyone. With such a great breakfast included it is unlikely you will find such a comfortable option for less money anywhere in Pisa.Additionally, the staff are friendly and accommodating. Don't let the front put you off. If you are used to British B&amp;Bs you may assume that there is nothing very welcoming or warm behind the plain door.Next time I am in Pisa I'll be back to the Arlecchini.",1,0.4665013227513228

252285090,Stayed here for a weekend break and it was great.  We stayed in a double room and there was plenty of space and a very generous bathroom.  When we arrived the receptionist was lovely very helpful and gave us maps of how to get around.  The room was great compared to a premier inn and the fact that we had a kitchen meant you could have a proper cuppa when you got up!! But we didn't really use it.  The bed was really comfy and I coulnt complain and the grab and go breakfast was great for me as there fruit to grab you keep you going.  The free wifi in the rooms and the fact that there was a free to us Mac in the room was a real bonus The only down side of the hotel is the glass door in the bathroom not great when your using the toilet facilities and there's no toilets at reception.Definitely a great find and if I was going back to Manchester id definitely stay again and would recommend it.,1,0.4644444444444444

On arrival, we were told that full payment would be required before we could check-in. In all my years of staying in hotels all over the world I have never had the indignity of a welcome like that. Despite having stayed here many times and despite being a long-standing member of the IHG Rewards loyalty scheme I was not to be trusted to pay my bill!When I challenged this I was told it was a change of policy brought in by the new franchisee in January.So someone needs to explain to whoever is responsible for this policy that, if they have a problem with non-payers, it is not with me. They should not use a sledgehammer to crack a nut. They should not alienate loyal customers like us by telling them they are not trusted.

It was sheltered from the road noise, we had a lovely view of the grounds, could open the windows and get a beautiful breeze -- in short, perfect. I was pleasantly surprised by the outcome and how willing the staff was to work to make us more comfortable. (I've stayed at many high-end hotels that wouldn't go this extra mile.) Also, since we arrived late on a Sunday, the restaurant was closed :( and room service ended at 9pm! Not what I'm used to. But we were desperate for food and too exhausted to go find something in town, so we ended up calling for room service at like 8:57pm and they were still extremely accommodating. The in-room service person was very friendly -- set our table nicely, made sure we had everything we needed, and was just really pleasant. (Honestly, the in-room food was just *meh*, but it came with such friendly service that I kind of forgave it!) The grounds were beautiful and well-kept, and the lounge patio was a great place to relax and have a drink just outside the mansion. The whole place was very quiet -- at first in an almost disconcerting way -- but we realized we wanted to be away from any hustle-bustle, so we were actually quite pleased to not have crowds of people around. It seems like the hotel must do a lot of conference/event business, and we were there when there didn't seem to be any big meetings going on, so maybe that made a difference. The pool was smallish, but well tended. The rooms are not super modern in terms of decor, but everything was in good shape, the bed was comfy, the bathrooms were clean and upgraded. PROS: beautiful grounds, great customer service, really nice outdoor lounge area to enjoy the scenery and the weather. CONS: a bit isolated, in-room food just so-so (we did not eat at the restaurant, so we can't review that -- might make a big difference to have had a great meal on site), some rooms are better than others, so I'd be specific if booking again. In the end, we'd definitely go back if we were visiting the area, especially given how well we were treated as guests! (I'd just make sure to request that upper level room with the view.)

The Park/Beach Chalet just down the road at the entrance of the Golden Gate Park was a perfect place to grab lunch or a good beer with a peaceful setting.  The hotel was kept up well.  Our maid service was excellent and the grounds, which consisted of a small pool, ping pong and small tables for the onsite restaurant were a charming touch to the center of the motel.  The rooms themselves are huge.  Yes, they need updating, but I wasn't staying at a Marriot.  There was a small fridge and plenty of room to stretch out after a long day of walking.  The only complaint I have is the shower.  All I ask is they upgrade to a handheld shower, it was quite an experience trying to wash my hair everyday.  The people were quiet &amp; friendly, not intrusive, but certainly not rude.  The restaurant, a local favorite, offered daily weekday specials for breakfast and a friendly, personable staff.  It does get crowded on the weekends so we only ate breakfast there during the week.  Plenty of food for the money and a good start to a long day, they keep the coffee flowing.  If you are looking for a comfortable stay near quaint settings in San Francisco this is the place for you.  My husband &amp; I would definitley go back.",1,0.5100600600600601

254690077,"Just back from a wonderful 4 day stay at Auberge St. Antoine. Enroute to the hotel from the airport our cabbie commented that it was the very best hotel in Quebec and he was absolutely right! While I already expected the hotel to be beautiful and the rooms to be above average, what impresses me the most in a hotel is the service and at the Auberge St. Antoine it was absolutely impeccable. The room was beautifully appointed, spacious, and the heated floors at this time of year a real luxury. We had a King - Deluxe (RM 409), so not even one of the higher end rooms and yet we had a beautiful view of the St. Lawrence. The bed was sumptuous... almost too comfy to leave. Loved the method for alerting the maid service via the red or green light outside the door. And while some turn-down services can be pointless, it was lovely to come back every night to fresh bottles of water, the next day's weather report and music softly playing in the room. We so enjoyed the little nooks off of the Artifact lounge where we cozied up to the fireplace to warm up and read after a day walking around in the cold. Treat yourself to a Caffe Artifact... delicious! Most impressive, however, was the offer to drive us to our restaurant in lieu of having to take a cab. Quite unsolicited, this level of service is unparalleled. While we didn't have dinner at Panache, we did have breakfast and it was wonderful. Perfect location... within walking distance to everything in Lower and Upper Town. Would definitely stay here again.",1,0.5547490347490348

The staff was really nice, not what other's have been saying on Trip Advisor.  The chocolate chip cookies and lemonade in the lobby is awesome.  Rooms were good, although the styling could be improved.  The restaurant next door was really good, well priced and fun to eat in.  The pool was great and we could see the Hollywood sign from our window! We tried to find free street parking, but it was tough so we just ended up getting the valet at the hotel, which was a little pricey ($18).  The location was great, lots to walk to (Grove, Farmer's Market, Ross, Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, etc).

We ended up booking the hotel through a discount web site called hotelsclick.com which I would recommend.  The rate we got was 102.50 GBR, which was about 40 GBR less than the hotel's lowest advertised rate.   As for the hotel itself, it is in a convenient location on a quiet street.  It is about a 20 minute walk to the main tourist attraction, the Piazza de Maricoli.  It is also just one block over from a main shopping district.  The rooms were very clean, well decorated and designed.  We were only there one night and perhaps the best surprise was the breakfast buffet in the morning. We have stayed in alot of hotels around Europe in the last 12 months.  Almost all of them offered breakfast, and the Hotel Bologna gets my vote for the best of the best.  The fruit was fresh, good selection of breads and pastries, cereals, coffee and teas, and scrambled eggs and bacon.  It was wonderful.  Almost wish we had extended our stay in Pisa just to have another morning at this hotel.One other much appreciated benefit if you are driving is off-street parking is available.If/when we go back to Pisa, we will be staying at the Bologna.",1,0.4084259259259258

The staff was quite friendly and helpful.The negatives: Road noise! We were put on the 4th floor in a room facing the busy 8 Freeway. The windows are not double paned and the road noise was quite loud 24/7. To their credit the staff offered to move us to a quieter room but that room had two queen size beds and we are used to sleeping in a King.I was told that the hotel is planning at some point to do something about the windows but I can't recommend the hotel until they double pane the windows to abate the road noise.,-1,0.575
155928779,"Stay here every week for 4 months. Half way through my stay they were renovating the lobby and second floor common area. The rooms are generally clean but nothing special. The staff were friendly and tried to make my stay comfortable. A few good eating locations around the area. So I never ate at the hotel.Lots of places in the neighbourhood had gates and bars on doors/windows. Walking to work in the morning I would find people sleeping on the street. Some would ladies would offer to sell me drugs or come back to my hotel room. I just said no and they moved on.Some rooms had umbrellas. If it was raining and I asked for an umbrella they'd occasionally tell me all the umbrellas were out and they couldn't help me.One morning I went to see if my flight was delayed but the wifi wasn't working. When I went downstairs to ask about it they told me it was a planned outage. I wished they told me the night before. I would have gotten the toll-free number for the airline to check my status. At that point, with no wifi, I had to go to the airport to see if the flight was delayed.Generally speaking, the wifi was not very good. Had a lot of trouble getting a good connection. Room in the right-wing of the hotel had horrible wifi. Best wifi was rooms right across from the elevators. I let them know that wifi was important to me. Once I found rooms which had good wifi they would try to check me into that room each time I returned. Never had a problem booking a room. The hotel was never full.You needed your room card to use the elevators. Quite frequently the card reader in the elevator didn't work and occasionally the card stopped working on my room door.

There was no problem however until we came to enter our room (205) when we found it had not been cleaned. The bed was unmade and there was evidence of the previous occupant - contact lense solution in the kitchen, dirty towels in the bathroom, dirty water in the sink etc.Staff apologised and managed to find us another room for the night (304) however this was also not in a completely clean state - it was lacking toiletries, the bins were still full or rubbish from previous occupants, there was hair in the bed. However we were very tired at this point and just needed to sleep so we did not make a fuss.We had agreed with the staff that we'd move back to our original room in the morning at 11am. They offered to move our luggage for us and were very apologetic. When we did move back the room was in a good state and the rest of our stay was enjoyable.There were some other minor annoyances during the stay: the apple mac computer in the room needed to be rebooted before it would work and the picture it produced was tinged with pink. The bed was very creaky and the shower had a tendency to cover the bathroom floor with water if you're not very careful with the shower curtain. But overall we were happy with the room.We had a pleasant stay it's just a shame our first impression was so poor due to the dirty room.

This review is not about that, however.For ten years now, my wife and I have made the pilgrimage from Black Diamond to the Lodge and back via motorcycle or sports car on a nice summer day. We always had lunch at the Obsessions CafÃ©. They always had a great soup and stew on offer as well as other goodies. I used to complain to my wife about the beef stew because it had too much beef and not enough veggies in it. That's how good it was. A &quot;large&quot; bowl of soup or stew was a meal in itself, accompanied by a fresh bun.Today when we arrived, all that was available was a vegetable &quot;stew&quot;, which turned out to be a watery collection of peppers and carrots. When the lovely young lady behind the counter pulled out the bowl to dispense my stew, I reminded her that I had asked for a &quot;large&quot;. &quot;This is a large,&quot; she replied.Long story short, the &quot;small&quot; bowl fits snuggly into the &quot;large&quot; bowl, suggesting that there might be a 10% difference between the two. I found out that the hotel &quot;downsized&quot; their bowls a few months before.(NB - Other travels and persistent rain in July and August had prevented us from doing the top-down drive for much of the summer. Thus, the new bowls were a surprise).We used to rave about the food at the cafÃ© and told others to stop there if they were passing by.

They are incredibly busy most of the year so it's worth booking well in advance. We were lucky to stay in one of their premier rooms, Michelangelo, which had a delightful balcony overlooking the courtyard garden.This B&amp;B simply oozes style, from its impressive living room/dining area as you walk in, complete with high ceilings and heaving bookshelves through to fruit &amp; pastries on the central table, art &amp; shabby chic furniture.Comfy bed and very decent shower all made our stay very relaxing. Couldn't fault the staff, from the girls running around offering us copious coffees and teas, to the cheerful manager who was handy with local directions &amp; tips.The only slight note of disappointment lay over the lack of fresh fruit at breakfast, the eggs which were on the wrong side of lukewarm &amp; shortage of bread.But hey, we were in Italy after all, we had a full agenda of places to go, so we weren't there for lingering breakfasts.By the way, their garden is a sheer delight and a total oasis Tables &amp; chairs here for guests to catch up on their reading, enjoy a leisurely coffee, or just soak up the rays.

The Hotel has a modern flair to its interior but is all charm and old world comfort at the same time. It's location is spectacular, at the base of the old port. It is close to the best restaurant in Quebec City, TOAST, and in the midst of the lower part of the old city. It is an easy walk to the funicular if you want to take a ride up to the Castle Frontenac or you can make the hike through the old city to get up top, as you choose. Rooms range from ample sized modern rooms with all of the comforts of home to suites that are a time capsule back to days gone by. We had a suite with a small patio. The space was beautifully furnished and the rooms were generous in size. The only knock on the suite was the lack of shades on the windows allowing a lot of night time light into the rooms.

Our shuttle driver Jeff felt like a friend and made some great suggestions for our trip. We were thrilled with a complimentary bottle of champagne on our special day. The rooms are updated and the beds are fabulous! The pool and gardens are beautifully maintained, you really feel the tropical ambiance of San Diego. Once we found our way around, with the help of staff, we found this location great. We didn't have a car and relied a lot on the great shuttle service and then became comfortable with the easy transit system in this beautiful city.

It is centrally located but quiet, with a few blocks setback away from major highways. All major malls and big box stores are easy to get to. The hotel is quiet inside, and on a relaxing nature walking/biking trail. Customer service was well informed about maps, travel connections, and things to do. Local newspapers are provided for free. I was particularly impressed how staff went out of their way to be patient and accommodating for every request for every customer. Rates were reasonable. They do need to improve continental breakfast and provide real creamers. A/C is noisy. Heaters are old and need cleaning. But front desk will give you a quiet room heater and extra blanket.

The room was well appointed, comfortable bed, spacious bathroom, and all the latest electronic requirements for WiFi, flat screen TV, and to turn the TV on was another new experience. The dining room appears cold, but the food was fantastic. We received a 10% discount for the restaurant and I must say that the service matched the wonderful food quality.

452205471,"My husband &amp; I enjoyed a one night stay in this beautifully located hotel.The property &quot;Kananaskis Village&quot; consists of the John Palliser Manor, Mount Kidd Manor &amp; the main Delta Lodge at Kananaskis.  The properties are accessible via a quick walk outside or we were told by walking through the underground parkade.  Reading previous reviews on TA, we were happy to be in the main lodge as our room was completely renovated (so newly renovated it had a strong new carpet/paint smell but opening the window for a while seemed to help).Our main floor room had a nice view of the forest, very comfortable king bed, large flat screen tv,&amp; a full set of toiletries.  While there was a Keurig machine with Starbucks coffee, we missed having a mini fridge &amp; in room safe.  These two items are a huge miss for us.  There was a table to use but oddly, only one chair to sit on.  When we called the front desk they quickly brought us a &quot;banquet&quot; chair so we could at least both sit at the table.We enjoyed the property &amp; took advantage of the Village Rim Trail, which was very well maintained for walking.  The property also has fat bike &amp; cross country ski rentals.  You can also enjoy ice skating on the pond &amp; the hockey rink.  In the summer there is tennis, basketball, a sportsfield, kids playground, picnic tables &amp; an abundance of hiking trails (beware of bears!).While we didn't take in the spa (unfortunately they don't offer couples massages &amp; single massages were pricey at $132 for 1 hr relaxation &amp; $144 for deep tissue), we did enjoy the indoor/outdoor hot tub.  There is also a dry sauna (outside access only), indoor pool (way too cold to use) &amp; a steam room.  The gym looked like it was furnished with new equipment as well.We had reservations at the Forte restaurant for dinner Friday night but once we were seated we realized it wasn't the place for us.  It has a cafeteria feel/set up &amp; for the prices of the meals we didn't feel it was worth staying.  It's really a family restaurant (loud) with uncomfortable chairs &amp; wobbly tables.  We decided to check out Woody's Pub (no minors allowed &amp; located in the Mount Kidd Manor) &amp; were delightfully surprised with our meals.  The Caesar salad was delicious &amp; the fish and chips special ($10) was excellent.  We enjoyed a hockey game &amp; a couple of beers each for a total of $58.00.  There is also Seasons Restaurant which we were told is high end &amp; a la carte meals start at $42.  There is another lounge in the main lodge (Big Horn Lounge) as well as Market Cafe for lighter fare.  Our lunch of a cup of soup &amp; slice of pizza was really tasty &amp; provided good fuel prior to our walk.Parking outside is free &amp; they offer underground for $5.00 per night.  There is a shuttle to &amp; from the ski hill Nakiska.  We saw alot of guests with their dogs &amp; quite a few families with young children.  The main lobby is beautiful, with a huge wood burning fireplace &amp; comfy couches &amp; chairs.Certain facilities on the property are really showing their age (the hot tub, steam room, Mount Kidd Manor) &amp; renovations are being completed over time.  The staff were friendly &amp; being surrounded by the beautiful Rocky Mountains really make this property's location spectacular.  Being only a 1 hour drive from Calgary, we would consider returning to this property in the future.",1,0.5479941249226964
324586486,"Picked this hotel for its price, location, and only planned to stay one night. While the room may have been a little on the small side and and a little more cushion in the bed, I really have no other reference in Pisa Italy. I slept well, had plenty of room for my carry-on backpack and daypack, and have no complaints. Great central location, about 20 minute walk from train station, and another 20 minute leisurely walk to the Leaning Tower. The location is far enough off the beaten path that it is quiet but there are small convenience stores and a handful of restaurants very close by (read warning about restaurant service charge on top of prices - ask before ordering). Bath is large enough for its purpose with a shower stall (I've seen smaller). Breakfast (included) is better/bigger than your typical Continental Breakfast  in Europe. If you are looking for a safe, air conditioned, relatively comfortable bed for the night while travelling light, this is a great place to stay. If you are looking for luxury, view from your room, are particular about hotel decorations, perhaps you should look elsewhere. Safe Travels.",1,0.5208095238095238

Originally had to invoke the Lowest price Guarantee which was done promptly and without fuss but on rebooking found that the prices direct were much more reasonable.Reception was quick and helpful, having only called to store our luggage we were told our room was available which was a nice surprise. We were also offered information on the area  and were spoken to each time we arrived or left the hotel. We were in a Grande Studio which was on the top floor. The landing was decorated in orange with a strong orange aroma although this was not noticeable once in the room. The room had motorised roof blinds and a lot of different lighting options. It was very spacious, very clean and was in good condition with only the odd signs of wear, although how  long will  the white leather chairs stay that way. The computer was easy to use but you do use the TV as the monitor. The kitchenette was clean and well set out with a fridge, kettle, toaster, dishwasher and microwave and a selection of plates,cups  etc. Tea and coffee are supplied and there is a good selection of groceries available in reception and plenty of convenience stores nearby.The bathroom had a jacuzzi type bath, toilet,  two sinks and a walk-in shower and was quiet large with a TV over the bath.

The rooms were nice (I had a loft), clean and well maintained. The cleaning staff were efficient. There is a pool, steam room and gym that you can utilize while you stay there, and a nice restaurant and pub (actually two pubs if you walk to the ajoining building). I found the staff very helpful and willing to assist me with some business matters I was attending to at a conference. They even made some phone calls and followed up on a delivery I was waiting for.My only wish was that they would put wireless interent in the rooms. You can get wireless, but you have to go down to the main lobby area or conference area. It is also a large horseshoe type design, so if you were travelling with someone that may had difficulty walking or with mobility, you may want or request a room located toward the front desk area. It can take a few minutes to walk to your room from the conference side. Overall, however, I would recommend this facility to friends and business associates for conferences and meetings.",1,0.571485260770975

We requested down free pillows repeatedly, but still had to call when we arrived to our room. They brought us pillows without cases, which defeated the purpose. The rooftop restaurant is small, the food is tasty, but I was disappointed that when we made a reservation for a cabana we were shown a table when we got there. We were told those were for preferred members. That kinda made me want to quit the Kimpton loyalty program. Finally, the valet parking company overseeing their parking services is terrible. Two attendants bad-mouthed the hotel and said they could live without tips. It was uncomfortable at best. There are much better hotels in this area.

My room was always clean and bed was made every night when I came back from class. The landscaping at the Garden Area was very much well kept and clean.  I guess the only draw back is they should clean out the outside trash cans everyday due to critters at night.  I saw a family of raccoons digging into the trash just several yards from my room.  Cute things to watch but dangerous especially if you have curious kids. You don't want to piss off a momma raccoon.  Several times I stayed at the &quot;Tower&quot;.  I didn't care for it.

120668979,"Some advise for those of you attempting to make reservations for the Dolce Hayes Mansion. We needed a room for only one night on a Tuesday and spend time surfing the web for a quality property close to where our business meeting was to be held. Although not our first choice, the Hayes Mansion had good reviews and was reasonably priced. We plugged in our info online to Expedia who came back saying no rooms available. Ok, how about Priceline? No rooms available. We went on to Hotels.Com &amp; Booking Buddy &amp; Kayak and found rooms available but they had a two night minimum stay. Not what we were looking for. Then we discovered that Booking.Com had rooms available and NO minimum. Great, lets call the hotel and book directly. So we called the hotel and spoke to a &quot;call center&quot; representative. We stated we needed a reservation for one night only. Her less than polite response was &quot;sorry but we have a two night minimum&quot;. We pointed out to her that we could book online and get a lower rate and stay for just the one night. Her response was, &quot;then book on line&quot; I can't help you. What?? You don't want my money?  But we have YOU on the line now.  Sorry she said, I can't over ride the system and she hung up. The reservation folks at Hayes mansion get a 1/2 star rating for the worst customer service of any property of this class.So we booked a KING room through Booking.Com for just the one night. Lesson learned... shop around.  A two night minimum is NOT required though all travel sites for this property and rooms may be available through different vendors. When we arrived at the hotel we found the property to be just as beautiful as we assumed. Well manicured grounds (groundskeepers get five stars here) and stunning buildings that were properly maintained! (building maintenance crew gets five stars also).The front desk staff was very proficient and professional and checked us in quickly. We were given a map of the property and keys to our rooms. When we opened the door to the room, we found that we had been placed in a double queen room instead of a King. We called the front desk and were immediately given another room with the reserved King bed. The front desk staff also gets a big thank you for making things right and the coveted five stars! Please note however that they bill you a $50 charge on your credit card for incidentals and credit you back within 3-5 days if you have no further charges to your room. We were not informed of this at the time of arrival, so we were a bit surprised when our total charges were more than expected. We suggest to management that you make it a practice to inform guests of this procedure at check in, rather than surprising your guests later on with the news.  The room we had on the third floor had a balcony facing Edenvale Ave which turned out to be quieter than we thought. The room was spacious, well furnished, and remarkably clean! The bed was comfortable, had quality sheets and lot's of pillows.  Wi-Fi worked well, the flat screen TV lacked in channel selection but we weren't there to watch TV anyway.  The bath amenities were top quality and the water pressure good.  Housekeeping gets a &quot;atta boy&quot; award for doing a superb job in keeping the rooms sparkling clean.  Five stars to them!We did not use any of the facilities, nor eat breakfast their, so it would be unfair to comment about such.  The property itself is very beautiful with spacious well kept grounds, and historic value. Would we return? Yes, as long as we book online and avoid the grumpy reservation agents at the call center. Lastly, for the price point we paid, we were shocked to see a bottle of water in the room &quot;for sale&quot; at $4 a pop! Not mineral water, not fountain of youth water, but purified water at $4.

The hotel also has a taxi service that charge you Eur 12 for trip to city center which is quite convenient. The normal taxi may also charge around Eur 10-12. We had a room with access to garden on ground floor and kids loved it. The souvenirs shops are just opposite the Hotel.,1,0.5428571428571428

The place is surrounded by beautiful flowers which I was told were planted by the owner himself. That is a sign of a person who is dedicated to his hotel. The hotel also has a great location in san diego close to ocean beach, downtown san diego and cabrillo (which has a great view of all of san diego). The rooms are clean and well furnished. At night if you open your windows you can hear the ocean waves. The Inn at sunset cliffs is one of the best hotels i have been to in San Diego, I would definitely go back there again and would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is thinking about going to San Diego.",1,0.6133333333333334

22970001,"I have stayed at this hotel twice before and have enjoyed my stay however, this year it was one problem after another. The best thing about the hotel was the view we had from our window, fantastic view of the Leaning Tower (see photo)We did, however have a few problems whilst we were there.  The fridge in the room did not work, the drinks were so hot they had started to smell when you opened the fridge, this was reported to the front desk but they did not bother to fix or replace before we left.  My family and i all left the hotel after 3 nights feeling very tired (due to a baby screaming in the next room and a party in the bar) and we had all obviously become a tasty treat for the Italian bugs. The main problem we had was that a member of my family had her night wear stolen from under the pillow.  The reception staff were not willing to help us, they were very unhelpful and implied it was our fault that the item of clothing had gone missing because it was left on the bed and may have been mistaken for a &quot;pillow case?&quot;  When we got home we emailed the hotel hoping we would get more of a response from them, we eventually got a reply and they suggested we send them a declaration stating the item that went missing and it's value, this was done back in November 08, i have emailed them a number of times since and heard nothing back.  Do not stay here, there are many other hotels in the area!!",0,0.3257971014492753

Every detail was carefully designed, right down to the bedside lights. And the staff was incredible.  When the night before we were departing for Montreal via train, I realized I booked the wrong date.  The front desk staff went right to work helping me change my reservation.

163358280,"This hotel is just off the main street of Santa Maria and you couldn't get much closer to the tower without paying much more. The rooms were a bit on the small side, it is only a 1 * so don't expect too much, but room to move around without bumping into things. On suite with shower etc. Beds were quite comfy and it was cool in the room without the need for fans or air con. No lift but only a few steps to the first floor. Design was rustic but plain walls set the scene. No food on offer but they had a coffee vending machine which sold some of the best cappuccino I have tasted for 50 cents. Snacks and water also available from the vending machines. No bar but the owners were very friendly and they had a small court yard which we used for pre-dinner drinks. We bought the wine and beer in the supermarket and plastic cups and enjoyed a few in the sun. Very accommodating and pleasant situation. If you are travelling by plane it is as easy to get a the train from the airport to the Main station, then the local line (to Lucca) to the first stop S.Rossore. Cost you 3 euros each and takes 10 minutes. A taxi will cost about 25 euros. If you want to walk then get off at the Main station, 1 stop, and walk to the hotel. This takes 15 minutes comfortable walking.Good supermarket, PAM, by the train station not far from the Tower. Cheap and a great selection. Lots of beers and wine a good prices.

Despite that initial confusion, the rest of our stay was incredibly pleasant. The staff was very helpful in making sure we could find parking. The rooms are spacious, and come with handy bedside tables. The price is high, but you pay for included parking and wifi and a safe, central location.",1,0.5145555555555555
155199720,"Just returned from this uniquely healing, heavenly Spa.Funny the spa was actually such a small piece of the amazing time! Two nights in March. The middle of a grand snow storm...fireplaces roaring, views to die for!We arrived and were whisked to our rooms after a brief tour and encouraged to change into our robes. I am a bit shy so I had my yoga clothes on with the robe and that was my uniform for the stay. I might add that within hours I had no make up on, hair pulled back in some messy thing that I care not to wonder about and flip flops.Tea Time - Decadent. The food is fantastic and the tea's delectable. Dinner - Good...but. I have to be honest I was a bit suprised by this as I had thought the food would be earth shattering...a high expectation...but the food was only very good. Uniquely challenging from the perspective because they use no perservatives no unnatural processing and all things from healthy local but still sometimes a bit dull. I am so sorry because everything else was brilliant!Breakfast - same as dinner...well presented, a great deal of effort and thought but err...I guess I am used to places that process...tragic for my health.Lunch - lovely. Food seemed a bit easier to pull off with flavour and flare! The dinning room is a beautiful space and again service is impeccable!Yoga - what a lovely helpful experience! I enjoyed the peace and felt that I was able to begin a journey in Yoga from this initial experience.Meditation - Deeply restful guided experience. I took it twice and I a mmissing it already!I had the Minerva Aqua treatment....hmm...NOT for the modest. But the overhead full body shower washed away most of my initial modesty...the Botanical Facial - FANTASTIC! My face looks better than ever, it was informative and deeply restful! Thank you!!!The building is beautiful - our room was a double bed with fireplace in the main building...rain shower head - BRILLIANT! The waiting room is easily my favorite place despite the MASSES.... I enjoyed having coffee on demand, tea and biscotti and apples. The second sitting room was more intimate and lovely with a roaring fire and a great game of Scrabble with my wonderful Mother!!The space where they offered Yoga and Meditation was a short jaunt outside...I was totally fine with it - kind of a giggle really...but others became upset. It will be great when they get the space back in the main building or develop a more direct route. Here are my only cautionary notes or recommendations:1) there was what I assume to be a senior staff who is a woman...on two occasions I experienced her speaking in a degrading manner to two different staff, at full volume. YIKES! Yucky not only for the staff but for us who like to dream we are in never never land but hear this incredibly unpleasant interaction. I do know her name....I don't want to post it publicly but I felt so sorry for the staff and I can only restate again the staff are INCREDIBLE! The exception being this individual.2) As the commanding priority at this stunning location is Health and Well Being...and it is clear through every moment...my only suggestion is that they put aside a more effective space to include the fitness equipment. I realize that this was likely intended as a relaxing getaway but fitness is very much a part of health and well being and there were waits for the treadmill and the space is clearly not intended for this. Plus the weights are buried in the basement in a room that does not match the incredibly high standard of space.3) If they could offer herbal tea to the available beverages in the waiting room - imagine this is a suggestion...this place really is so SPECTACULAR...that this is my final and only other recommendation.Thank you so much St. Anne's Spa!! I arrived rattled, shaken and not stirred...tentative, anxious about this journey and reluctant to imagine three days could restore me....IT DID! Thank you thank you thank you!!I look forward to a return, I will recommend this fabulous retreat to every person I meet and I am deeply grateful to my wonderful Mother for sharing this blessed experience with me - 5 Stars hands down! Oh speaking of hands - the lotion...JOY!!!",1,0.6001935081148564

I was pleasantly surprised since I was 20 minutes early and was not expecting any special treatment. The room itself was a little old as you could see from the scuff marks on pretty much every surface but it was clean and functional. The pillows were kind of lumpy and too firm for my taste. Would suggest the way other hotels do it where not all the pillows are the same kind. A bit of an awkward wake up at 5am from some noisy neighbours. It was a very good price so I guess I got what I paid for. The staff were very friendly and helpful so I would go again...maybe just bring my own pillow and ear plugs. ,0,0.5953061224489796

250409114,"We took a long weekend trip to Quebec in winter. The off season at the Frontenac was fabulous without the crowds. Everyone in the hotel could not have been nicer and more welcoming. We splurged and got the gold package which gave us more than the typical continental breakfast like salmon, eggs (not the usual scrambled variety either), meats. They have a wonderful espresso machine that is a bit intimidating but easy and delicious. They also have regular coffee. With the gold package you can have all the soft drinks, bottled water, coffee and tea. You do have to pay for the beer, wine and alcohol. It's nice to take a bottle of water after breakfast when you go out for the day. The evening they have a happy hour with snack items specially made by a chef. Some of the items weren't to my taste but if you are willing to try something different you won't be disappointed. There were no sweets (cakes, cookies) With the gold package you save money on breakfast and if you eat a light dinner the happy hour might save additional money. The room was very nice, comfortable and roomy.The view of the town was great too. The great part about the location of the hotel is you are close to everything. We walked to the citadel, shopping, and restaurants. There are other historical sites in walking distance. Montmorency Falls and the Ice Hotel (Hotel Glace) are less than 30 minute drives and worth it. Even though it was cold we enjoyed our weekend and took home many new memories.",1,0.6218676484805516

The sink was sleek, but leaked slightly if you don't pay attention, and the only other minor concern we had was the lack of counter-space around the sink.Parking was $15 daily at a lot 30 seconds down the street, and you can come and go as you please with a scanning-card. Breakfast was included, and was great for the mornings when we were tired of eating crepes and fancy breakfasts outside the hotel.  The breakfast server was very sweet and charming.Reception staff was very helpful and friendly, and we highly recommend having a meal at &quot;Le Toast&quot; restaurant in the garden terrace of the hotel.

We decided to get two of the smaller suites (for us and our two teenagers) ... and they were magnificent.  Each utterly unique, classic and never to be forgotten.  One suite was entirely wood, with cross beams and open space.  The other was white classic French decor, with a balcony onto a courtyard with a view of the city/water.  The staff could not have been more fantastic.  The NBA finals were happening and my 13 year old son wanted to see the game.  I asked if they knew what the channel was ... and rather than just look it up, they suggested that (if no one had booked it) they could open up their theater and we could watch it in there.   So, for the two games that happened while we were in Quebec, we were in a full on theater, watching the game on a large HD screen with surround sound ... talk about a memory ...The attached restaurant Panache ... was also pricy ... but the Chef is gifted ... and you should try it out as well.There are two rooms off of the Hotel cafe with all manner of Board games and things for kids to do if they need to wait for you to get something organized.The concierge desk was as good as I have ever experienced.  They arranged for us to take a bike tour of city that was fantastic and every restaurant or attraction suggestion was right on the mark.The location could not be better.  Truly.

Painfully slow, even when the bar is empty. A Northern Irish barman seemed overwhelmed when I ordered two drinks.And that was nothing compared to the experience at breakfast.  There is an ample number of staff working but there is no proper control over what happens. People have to wait to be seated despite plenty of empty tables.

The porter was unfriendly and constantly grumbled, seeming most put out that we'd actually arrived a little earlier than the time of arrival we'd given.

We also found a foot-long tear in one sheet.I got dressed and went down to the porter to explain the problem in my faltering Italian. He came up to the room, saw the sheets and then disappeared (grumbling all the time). He returned a few minutes later with new sheets and told us to make ourselves a new bed and to strip the old sheets off and throw them in the corner.  He then left.We proceeded to make our own bed but as we put the new sheets on we noticed more stains - I prefer to think that these new stains were coffee or tea but they could easily have been blood. This time my wife and I took the sheets down with us and asked for another room. He told us this wasn't possible as the hotel was full (this obviously wasn't the case) and he claimed that the marks were &quot;ironing stains&quot;. After grumbling some more he unlocked a cupboard, handed us another set of sheets, locked the cupboard and then walked off. We took these sheets back to our room only to find they were for a single bed.By this point it was past midnight and we were exhausted so my wife and so we stretched the sheets across the bed as well as we could and went to sleep. Unsurprisingly, we checked out from Hotel Milano first thing the next morning.",-1,0.4195588287051701

Fault with shower dealt with within couple of hours of reporting. Air con was absolute necessity in bedroom in the temps of 30 degrees and it certainly worked perfectly. Breakfast is continental style with cold meats, cheeses, cold eggs, biscuits, fruit, cake made by their Swiss chef which was delicious uof and light, hot pastries and croissants and hot frankfurters. Hot cooked eggs could be ordered along with coffee from the kitchen. We preferred to walk to Bar Costa next door for decent coffee!! Fridge in the bedroom was a nice touch - took their stuff out and put own water &amp; juice in. Lovely cheap little mini market across the road so stocked up on Fanta &amp; Pringles! Fabulous pizzas for tea at Quatro D'Ora across the way then back to the rooftop terrace to watch the sun going down drink in hand - lovely. Lots of good restaurants surround the hotel. Don't miss the lovely alabaster shop directly opposite the hotel. Nothing was too much trouble for the hotel staff, all very friendly and helpful.

Ground level rooms are ideal for owners of well-behaved dogs, and of course Dog Beach (which I say is the Happiest Place on Earth, not Disneyland) is just a few steps away. Beware of the burr-bearing plants along the way though, for dogs and bare feet.  From second-story rooms you can see the beach, palm trees and the ocean, as well as the channel sailboats use to access the sea from the Bay. (This channel is what keeps OB separated &amp; insulated from the tourist beaches)  Just a few minutes walk along the beach is the pier &amp; the bustling restaurant/bar area of Newport Ave, yet at night you are removed from the noise of the young partiers by being at the other end of the beach. All you hear is the surf lulling you to sleep as the cool offshore breeze wafts through your screened patio door. Who cares about TV or Holiday Inn-like furnishings when you can walk to the beach in less than 3 minutes? The pool is small but very pleasant, and the motel management is much more friendly and responsive than it used to be. Note there are legal fire pits on the beach but you need to claim one early if you want one for after dark.

278362953,"Hotel Le Priori is on a cobblestone street in the heart of the Old Port. We stayed in one of the suites that's in a separate building set back behind the hotel for part of our honeymoon. With our own loft suite, we had a dedicated balcony with a hot tub. It was so quiet and quaint and peaceful. We loved feeling like we were a bit isolated from the hub-bub.For our first trip to Quebec City, it was a great location. But it is a bit touristy in Old Port, so when we come back, we'll probably stay on the other side of old town.",1,0.4458333333333333

We did not take the car other than visiting the Isle d'orleans which is a driving trip anyway. If you want comfy, stylish and perfectly located - stay here.

AV-TGuWBa4HuVbedGcJK,"I stayed in a huge two-room suite here, and I just don't understand the appeal. Perhaps my tastes are just not, ahem, refined enough, but I found the hotel to be a bit stuffy and uninspiring. This was the 3rd or 4th St. Regis that I've stayed at, and I finally realized that the brand just isn't for me. I guess I prefer more modern or unique hotels. It wasn't a bad experience, and the separate living room would be helpful for entertaining a certain type of client, but I wouldn't stay here alone and I wouldn't stay here for a romantic trip.The service was spectacular in the suite, and included a private butler. That said, I don't really need a private butler when I stay in a hotel. The front desk workers were friendly if not downright charming. The hotel lobby is small and, for my tastes, uninteresting. It lacks the wow factor. The concierge was very good, but seemed to sigh when he realized I had such pedestrian questions such as what new broadway shows might be worth seeing (I've been to NYC more than 30 times, but I always ask the basics).For the money, I'd pick the Waldorf Astoria or the Gramercy Park hotel for its warm, sumptuous colors and textures (in the larger rooms) or even the Mandarin Oriental.Note - I stayed in this hotel in 2014.Dear Allen,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback regarding your stay with us.We are sorry to learn that the style of our historical property did not meet your preferences, but are glad to read that you enjoyed our team's service. As far as our Concierge is concerned, rest assured I will personally follow-up and use your feedback as a re-training opportunity.When Mr. John Jacob Astor and his wife Caroline built the hotel in 1904, on purpose, they wanted to have a very small lobby to make the arrival experience of their friends and family members as intimate and as home-like as possible. While we treasure and value the heritage of our hotel, we do realize that the lobby size might not be of a wow factor and we apologize if you were disappointed.Hopefully you will visit us again and give us more opportunities to be at your service.Have a wonderful start of the new year!!Sincerely,DanielaOn behalf of The St. Regis New York Team",0,0.6061397951641853

133448657,Great convenient hotel close to Sea World.  Do stay in the Royal Palm Tower (new).  When we 1st arrived we were in the Regency Tower (old). We were not satisfied with the room they gave us. They moved us the next day and Katie (front desk manager) was very helpful and really accommodating to our needs. She even remembered that my family and I were thinking about going to the county fair and told us to see Jill (concierge) because she remembered that Jill said they had extra tickets to the fair. Jill even gave my daughter a stuff animal sting ray.  Terrace cafe has a great breakfast buffet and it was a great way to fuel up before heading out to Sea World for the day. 1 minor problem was looking for parking when returning back from Sea World.  I.T.T was having a graduation ceremony at the convention so they took up most of the parking but that was only for 1 night we were there.  The bridge to the fashion valley mall from the parking lot right across the street is convenient to go shopping.

Also would like to mention that we forgot a couple of items in the bathroom and when I called to ask if they had been found, I was immediately transferred to housekeeping where I spoke to a lovely lady who put my items in the mail that very same day.

149761046,"We didn't book directly with Marriott, so the desk attendant said we only had two choices for our room which was right next to a busy elevator......OR way in the back squeezed next to the emergency exit stairs!  Well, we chose the latter because we knew that right by an elevator couldn't be quiet.  The room was so tiny!  And it had only one very small window that didn't open very far.  It was definitely quieter, but it was so small!  We were definitely squished into a corner and we were staying for two weeks!  That was really unfortunate.  However, I have to say that the lobby was set up nicely, especially for business travelers with lots of couches and tables where you could plug in your computer and have coffee and big flat screen televisions.  It also had a nice snack bar and the food was pretty good too.  The fitness center was okay....although they could use some other equipment and better free weights. The pool area is nice too and the jacuzzi was nice and hot and very clean.  Only the last day there, they closed the jacuzzi for some kind of repair, but at least they offered guests to use a nearby hotel's jacuzzi.  We also liked their snack machines (on the way to the elevators)  where you can get a variety of snacks and even an ice cream bar!  Parking was ample, even though the back parking lot is so slanted that I can't imagine what happens when there is a good rain.  We didn't like the $16.00 a day we had to pay for parking though and wireless internet in your room is not free either.  However my husband was able to use a conference room in the lobby to have a Skype meeting and that was free.  The hotel is nicely located in Mission Valley where you can get to almost anywhere quickly and very easy to access Fashion Valley Mall and the movie theater.

The manager,   Tim I believe was his name, was very cordial and visited with us a long time in the lounge. We disagree totally with a recent review that says the hotel is worn and needs refurbishing! The hotel is ideally situated to walk out the back door onto the pedestrian walkway to shops, restaurants, gondola, and the views are breathtaking!

90847644,"I know people usually begin these reviews by saying that &quot;they never write these kinds of reviews&quot;... almost like a warning that their review is extraordinarily important, and now I kind of understand why. This is my first---and hopefully my last review, primarily because I understand that experiences are subjective and I would HATE for mine to poison the pot--like how spoiled North American travelers often do for hotels abroad or in the Caribbean. Anyway, I was extremely underwhelmed with the quality and services at the Best Western Brant Park. Let me get one thing out--- I traveled with my boyfriend AND my small PUG Vittorio... we booked online and called directly after to let them know we would be traveling with a dog (I knew from the Website that they allowed pets). What I didn't know was that their PET POLICY is EXTREMELY discriminatory. They have (4) rooms set aside for people traveling with Pets. These 4 rooms are all the same--side by side at the very back end of the Hotel, the farthest from the lobby. There was NO choice at all--- 2 double beds &quot;standard.&quot; Now I realize that we were traveling at an awkward time (x-mas eve to boxing day) and I expected the hotel to be semi-deserted and to probably not have maid-service etc. What I didn't anticipate is that the heating system must have been on the &quot;energy saving&quot; setting because the hallways and rooms were VERY cold...the carpets were filthy and the paint on the walls was a chipped mess. The restaurant was closed- fine-- we were going to my mothers to eat anyway... however the continental breakfast was ALSO cancelled---- when I asked for a rebate they denied. Even though they had no difficulty charging an extra 20$ onto the rate for my Pug.What bothers me the most is that I don't think this hotel understands that its ONLY AS GOOD AS ITS STANDARD ROOM, I don't care about the damn Wayne Gretzky wing or the upgraded mini suite with kitchenette or whatever they heck they are hocking in those internet photos... This place needs an INTERVENTION from the best western head office or something. For 160$ a night for a standard room during LOW season, I felt like they committed highway robbery on me. The room had a sliding glass door giving a view of the highway and a huge deserted parking lot, it was as if we were staying at a MOTEL, not exactly the Bates Motel, but something along the lines of a Motel 6 or Econo Lodge.What really annoyed me is that just because I traveled with my Pug I felt it I lost all my leverage to argue about the quality. I was treated SUB-HUMAN because I am an animal lover. I Understand that Dogs present some kind of liability to the hotel--which is why I agree with the 20$ extra charge and I agree that tipping the maid extra would also be a good idea, however- - - I am not bringing in a wild boar--- don't throw me in the COLD deserted back end of the hotel and charge me extra---Needless to say, I won't be returning to this particular Best Western...they have a discriminatory pet policy, the rooms are awful and dated, the maids and the front desk don't communicate with each other (the maids were knocking on the door asking when we were checking out---uh CHECK THE FRONT DESK) and the clientele is suspect.p.s I dropped a piece of a banana on the carpet at night and in the morning those little mini ants were helping themselves, it was COMPLETELY disgusting. I understand ants will inevitably come, but after only a few hours in the dead of winter--- I think a fumigation  may be in order",-1,0.4625000000000001

Thus I am not certian what caused these symptoms in this season. It could be very possible that the room is full of allergens.

We could not get the air conditioning to work and couldn't open the windows as the mosquitoes came in - unlike some other hotels in the area the windows didn't have insect screens. I said in the morning at checkout  that the air conditioning didn't work in our room and was told that it was switched off as it was now 'winter'!

355805740,"We stayed during 11-14th March. The Hotel overall we felt was not good value for money.  Our room a building outside of the main hotel facing the car park was very dated. Most importantly though, the bed was very comfortable and the sheets were clean. Although the room was kept clean, our towels were old and didn't smell that nice.  Our cleaner kept the room spotless, taking pride in what she did and was always smiling.The breakfast although typical for a 4* Hotel in Italy, did offer slightly more than normal, scrambled eggs, boiled eggs, sausages and these items were always barely warm. Cheeses, hams, pastries, cakes, cereal, some fruit, a good coffee machine and a pancake maker. It is really all down to preference, but the breakfast on offer just did not seem very appealing to me.The internet although free was rubbish. I had to stand in the corner of the bathroom to get a flicker, which inevitably cut-off after a minute or so and was very frustrating, especially when you need access to check emails or god forbid check in with work.  Sadly I felt the photos of the hotel were a little misleading, it all needs a good lick of paint, tables and chairs in the breakfast area were all a bit tatty, table covers looked very old and it made it seem unclean, although I did notice the staff all work hard to keep everything hygienically clean and were continuously wiping the tables over.  The plus side is the location of the hotel, which is in a very good position and not far at all from Pisa train station or the local sites. On arrival at the airport, we paid for a local bus to Pisa train station and then walked from the train station to the hotel in around 10mins, a pretty direct route.  The hotel is in what seemed to be a quiet road, might be different other times of the year. The Leaning Tower of Pisa was a short walk away, around 5-10mins slow stroll, with plenty of shops, bars and restaurants along the way.  As mentioned, Pisa train station is very close and we took a very straightforward trip to Florence too and had a wonderful time. The hotel has a lot of potential, but I really do not feel they can justify their room charges for what they offered during our stay.",1,0.5641243961352658

We had to wait 2 hours for someone to arrive to settle up the bill the evening before we left.  This old Victorian historic home with tall ceilings and too many chandeliers to count had a small yard and fountain out front which could be enjoyed from the second floor patio.  Our room was small but had 2 windows and the door on the chifforobe would not stay shut.  There was a used bar of soap left in the shower and none on the sink. No basic amenities like water glasses or shampoo were in in the room but those items as well as wine glasses and ice were available in a cubby behind a hanging curtain at the bottom of the stairs; one day we had a rug in the bathroom for 6 hours and although the room was cleaned daily, the used glasses were not taken away. No coffee or tea were offered, not even packets or plug in pots which were sorely missed upon awakening.On the plus side, the location was smack dab in the middle of the French quarter and a ten minute walk to the conference we were attending.

You get a cool room, nice breakfast with a wide choice of self-serve items, and access to the best restaurants and sights the city has to offer.  On the downside, the beds were not that comfortable and the front-desk staff were pretty indifferent, but that didn't spoil the intimate and romantic vibe.Adjacent to the property is the hotel's restaurant, Toast, a great place for small plates of local cuisine with a few twists and some heavenly desserts.Just don't stay in the same room as your mother-in-law as the sink and claw-foot tub are located in the main bedroom, with only the toilet and shower separated by a door.",1,0.511702380952381

I also appreciated that there were a number of power outlets adjacent to the working desk. Food at the Panache (breakfast) was very good - though on both mornings we were there, the staff were straining to serve the clients (not enough?).

Aren't there food temperature laws in California?  The selection wasn't as good as in previous years.  Also, there was no toaster available to toast the bagels, etc.  How about bringing back the toaster as part of the breakfast buffet?  The coffee, supposedly Starbucks, was absolutely watery.The Sunshine Deli, with its friendly staff, had a good selection of cold salads, but the lettuce wasn't as fresh as it could be.  For the prices charged, the food quality and coffee served there should be better.  The first night (Wednesday) of my stay Charlie's was closed.  Why??  We went to Kelly's for a drink and found the bartender and staff friendly and the drinks and appetizers good.  However, the restaurant was really like stepping back into the 1960's.  With a little bit of upgrading, it could be a great place instead of appearing old and sad.  You can't exactly attract a younger crowd of people with that ambience.On Saturday night, our convention group went to Charlieâs to celebrate.  They tried to close the place at midnight despite that fact that we have a contract which that stated that they are to stay open until 2 am.  We had to produce the actual contract to get them to stay open.  Even then, there was some grumbling by the staff about having to stay open for a handful of people.  We tried to order food before midnight and was told that they kitchen was closed.  A group of us had to order delivery pizza to get food at that hour.  Poor business.  At least have the staff let its customers know that the kitchen is about to close.  The general atmosphere at Charlieâs is not friendly.  As in the past, the grounds are beautiful and well maintained and the pools are clean.  The Spa is excellent.  It wouldnât take much to have the Town and Country Resort a four star accommodation rather than a three star.  It is the little things that make or break a hotel.

The good news is that it cost very little to take the bus vs. a cab, but the downside is that the bus lets you off on the back side of the train station and you have to walk through it to get to the front which is where the hotel is. In fact, it takes longer (10 minutes or so) to get to the station from the bus stop than from the hotel. Since we were going to take a train the next day and were less than 5 minutes for the station, it was extremely convenient. The hotel allowed us to check in very early at no additional charge... a huge plus. The gentleman checking us in was very friendly and helpful. Once settled it took about 20-30 minutes to walk to the obligatory leaning tower area. The walk itself was fun and interesting. Since we were only spending the night we did not have time to explore the town or the other sight in the leaning tower area, and there are several worth exploring. The breakfast was pretty good and the internet worked just fine.On the &quot;con&quot; side we would have to admit we wondered what we were getting into when we first saw the neighborhood, but we felt very secure and in less than a block you were out of the area. The hotel, like almost in the are, was old and the room fairly small, but it was clean. If you do not like to (or cannot walk) you will need to take a cab to the tourist attractions. For us it was worth it and we would likely stay there again. All we were looking for was a place to sleep and shower before heading off to our next adventure.",1,0.4361309523809523

The most important was the value (price verse accommodations and services) was not at all worth the price for this hotel (Chateau). You pay for all small services (wifi, coffee). You can receive many more services for free (or fraction of price) at more updated hotel chains in historic Quebec that are also central. The hotel room styles (while some rooms have been renovated) are too dated (old feeling, not a good redesign), the lobby and small shops make you feel like you are back living in the 1970's. Also, for the high price and the name (Chateau) you expect to walk into a castle / enchanting place and say WOW. But the truth is, the outside is beautiful and the inside fails to be memorable and actually disappoints your anticipation of grandeur.

Our only complaint with housekeeping is that they would only leave us 2 washcloths each day so we always had to call and get more.  They brought them quickly, but you'd think that if there were 5 people in a room, that they would leave more than 2.We only ate the free breakfast once - at 7:30 in the morning.  We tried the other 3 days later (around 8 &amp; 8:30) and the line was out the door.  It just wasn't worth it for us to wait that long for toast, bagels, cereal &amp; juice.  Also, the breakfast room was very small and was extremely HOT - there was no air flow in there at all, so it was very uncomfortable.  Don't know if they did that to keep people from staying very long or what.  Anyway, breakfast totally not worth it at this La Quinta.  We've stayed at other La Quinta's before and breakfast has been much nicer.  Oh well, we weren't there for the food!All in all, a good place for our family to stay.  Location was good - Sea World was about 10 minutes away.  It's also near a shopping center with lots of places to eat.  I booked through La Quinta's website and kept checking back every day - was able to reduce my rate by about $35/night by checking and canceling/redoing the reservation.

We stayed in both the main Delta lodge and the John Palliser hotels.The front counter staff were very helpful in particular Emma, Kalvin (Manager) and Scemoore. They couldn't do enough for you, were very friendly and sorted any issues out quickly. Not that we had any really, there was an issue with my travel card and they went above and beyond to sort out the problem with my bank card. All staff were very helpful, always had a smile on their face and nothing was too much trouble. The beds were very comfortable, the rooms clean and well equipped and the surrounding grounds of the hotel were stunning. You don't actually have to go far for beautiful views (2 mins walk). We got to try out the new spa which is great for a day of relaxing. They have an ice rink on site which is great if you have kids and there are plenty of walks straight from the hotel. They do a great initiative where you can help the environment instead of having your room cleaned everyday (Or you can have it cleaned if thats what you choose), they plant trees instead which we thought was a great way to give back to nature. All in all it was a superb hotel, worth the extra money and we would definitely stay again.",1,0.5152003910068426

Chef Erik was incredible, making his rounds to all the tables including mine for Brunch where we shared foodie stories and his love for the new location atop the LA universe.  The food and cocktails were simple but delicious and so reasonably priced, especially for a hotel, that I kept going back again and again without guilt or fear of breaking the bank.Bottom line:  I am already planning my return trip in the fall and The Hotel Wilshire is at the top of my booking list!Sincerely Satisfied,David DeSanto",1,0.5143887858173573

Tremendous amount of San Jose history surround you. Excellent remodeling, keeping the historical character of the site. The staff is very accommodating and friendly. Lots of area surrounding with hiking trails. The only drawback, which could be a positive, is that it's a way out of the San Jose downtown and nightlife. Yet the site provides lots of after work relaxation.  The plaza bar is nice with a comfortable outside area for casual dining or after meeting conversation.

Only a five minute walk to Piccadilly Gardens for bus and tram service (tram goes direct to the stadium).From the moment we walked through the door of the hotel staff were friendly and helpful, outstanding service.  The ground floor is a spacious bar/cafe area, reception was friendly, cool cucumber water available, a quick check in and an information sheet about transport to the concert.  Our room on the first floor was spacious and clean, with a king bed and nice linens. Curtains make the room dark enough to sleep during the day.  The TV had satellite channels but the signal was a bit fuzzy so the picture jumps a bit.  There was a safe in the room but no mini-fridge.  Chairs and table are convenient, spacious wardrobe (with a light inside!) and an iron and board in the cupboard as well as spare pillows.  The bathroom was clean and spacious, good size bath, separate shower cubicle, good water pressure, nice soaps and shower gels and large towels.  Being on the corner of Portland Street and Princes Street and on the first floor, there was some street noise as the clubs kicked out but Sunday morning was quiet and good for a sleep in.We had a relaxing time after the concert, only basic sandwiches available after 11pm, no hot food, but was enough to keep hunger at bay.  Good security at the door at night.  Breakfast was excellent, great service again, soy milk available on request, vegetarian options for cooked breakfast, the usual suspects for cereal and fruit at the buffet as well as different fruit juices and pastries, bread and cheeses.

After much research we chose the Hilton as Tom Lefkovtis, the room division Manager, was very helpful in making sure we were comfortable.  From the moment we checked in we were treated like Royalty.  Every staff member we encountered was friendly and willing to do anything to ensure we were happy.  We were greeted as Mr and Mrs Dawson by most staff members even though we had not even spoke with some of them before.  The food and service in the hotel restaurant and bar was fantastic.  The hotel suite we had was very spacious and spotlessly clean.  We had a full kitchen, a real fireplace (they came and lit the fire for you whenever you request it) and a huge bathroom!  I cannot say enough about our experience at this property.  The staff here are obviously very well trained in customer service.

This year, we saw all the renovations they have been doing for the last year or so (75 Million $). We had a nice room on the 6th floor, but it was more like 6-1/2 floor. We had to take some stairs to reach our room from the sixth floor. But it was all right, we had a nice view on the St. Lawrence and the Promenade, a first for us. We participated into the 2 seminars offered by the hotel, one about mixing drinks at the new 1608 Bar and another one showing us recipes served at the ChÃ¢teau with the famous Chef Stephane Modat. It was great. We were able to get a table at the magnificent Champlain restaurant and everything was perfect. The only down side would be the 1608 Bar. We were there at 2 different times and it is hard to find a table for a drink and it is very noisy, not cozy like it was before. More modern is not always better. For the room, the bed was very comfortable with nice linen. We had a hard time adjusting the heat in the room, it would get really warm fast, we had to adjust at the lowest or when we would shut it down, it would get cold. We had a hard time with the TV too, the cable was not working good for a lot of channels. One thing we would appreciate would be free Wi-Fi, this being offered in a lot of hotels.

Another receptionist taught us some phrases. Just totally charming.Our room has a four poster bed, king sized, marble floor and great air conditioning. It smells beautiful - an earlier reviewer suggested this wing smells of cat pee, but I can well imagine why the receptionist would be surprised. Maybe their cat peed in their luggage before they left? It smells as fresh as a daisy. We came home at lunchtime to find the rooms pristine and clean, fresh towels and bedding, like magic. They don't serve breakfast, but you're five minutes away from any number of places that do so I can't see that's any issue at all.

There were smaller skylights below which did open, but had no window stays to keep them open, a shame as we like fresh air in the room.We didn't use it, but there was a good selection of food and drink in The Pantry area at reception.The Grab and Go breakfast was just right with juice, coffee/tea, pastries and fruit.

There was mold all over the roof of the shower and one wall and a sewer smell from the bathroom sink. The smell of smoke was everywhere. We asked the front desk to have houskeeping to put bleach in the sink and clean the wall and roof of the shower but nothing was done during our 3 night stay. I don't feel well and I think it is from the mold. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone,-1,0.55

Went to the indoor pool which is about a ten minute walk.  Ground around outdoor hot tub was littered with dog poo and the chairs are not comfortable.  Lunch was a little disappointing.  Ordered a noodle bowl which was supposed to be filled with vegetables and received a bowl of white rice drowning in soy sauce with three shrimp on top.  Treatment was excellent - I had a plant peel.  Wish that they enforced the silence rule in treatment area as it was less than relaxing as I listened to other ladies discussing their lives.

The concierge and front desk people were totally charming and helpful. The breakfast room and food is not to be missed ... worth every bit of the relatively high price. Being able to take your grand-kids tobogganing on the hotel's &quot;front porch&quot; was priceless.

256440710,"This is a fantastic place with top service!  I would highly recommend this hotel; and the service is second to none - reminded me of the service I've received in Disney Resorts.  We had a 10 hour drive from CT, but it was well worth it.  My husband and I split up the drive with our 4 year old in the back.  We pulled in, and the valet helped us with bags and parked our car (same price as self park).  Entrance way is stunning! And coming in from the bitter cold, it was fabulously warm and inviting.  Check in was painless; just needed to email them the confirmation email from the vendor I booked with.  Had fun finding our room since the layout of the hotel is not symmetric; different elevators and some long walkways, but everything had good signs and we didn't get lost at all - it was fun exploring the different floors and windows and views.  We stayed in newly refurbished king room - and it did not disappoint.  Bed was super comfortable and room was fresh and clean.  Bell hop was up with our bags timely and showed us around the room - safe was in the bedside drawer, and nice and big compared to wall safes.  Pool was very nice and the dinner was excellent.  The next day, breakfast had a nice buffet, but many of the items were cold and it was overpriced ($28/person).

284790412,"This hotel gave us good value for the money, considering the convenient location to all the San Diego tourist attractions. The room was clean and comfortable, although the A/C was a little on the loud side, and we had to struggle a bit to get the room to stay a comfortable temperature all night. Parking was $10/day, but almost all the hotels in the area charge similar prices. At least there was some covered parking for that money -- many other hotels just have outdoor parking for that price. But if you have a medium to large vehicle, getting in and out of the parking lot can be a bit tricky if another car is coming in the opposite direction.The breakfast was decent. Several kinds of breads/muffins, etc, with four waffle makers, yogurt, hard-boiled eggs, fruit, etc. No hot foods like bacon or saussageor scrambled eggs. The room was large and they had some outdoor seating too, but it did get pretty crowded in there.Here's our customer service issues: we had problems with our toilet so we asked for maintenance. They came with a plunger, which fixed it temporarily, but the guy said if it gives us any more problems, they'd have to come back with the auger. Sure enough, the next morning, we almost had an overflow. I called the front desk and told them what the maint guy said the evening before, and I told them we really needed to use the toilet, and we had to wait 20 min for a guy to come with just a plunger. They obviously didn't listen to me at all. Then it took another 30 min for another guy to come back with the auger. When you gotta go, and you have to wait an hour (needlessly), it's a bit of a problem.Later, we went to the pool (which was pretty nice, by the way) and they were out of towels, so I went to the front desk and they told me they would deliver them &quot;right away&quot;. After 1/2 hr of no towels, we flagged down two housekeepers in the area, and both said they'd call the front desk and ask to have the towels delivered. Another 1/2 hr passed w/o towels, so we flagged down a THIRD housekeeper. His name was Caesar, and he stopped cleaning one of the rooms and personally went to pick up and deliver some towels to the pool area. Kudos to Caesar -- if La Quinta management is reading this, give that guy a promotion!I complained about the service at checkout and they gave me ~ $50 off the two-night stay, which I think was a reasonable offer, so I give them credit for that. So my rating was: 4 stars had we not had any customer service issues, then I would have knocked it down to 2 stars for the service issues, but raised it back up to 3 stars since they compensated us for our trouble.",0,0.430109126984127

The Asian lady opened a drawer and pulled out some bottles and said &quot;this is all we have&quot;.  I said this is shower gel and she said it's all the same and went back to her computer.  I was stunned.  I went upstairs to find a bottle of &quot;shampoo&quot; in the tub but no shower gel.  As I was leaving for my business meeting, I asked my husband and daughter to get the car while I spoke with the front desk.  When I spoke with another staff member (Trevon, I think) about the tub and shampoo incident, he pulled out a basket right underneath the same drawer and gave me bottles of &quot;shampoo&quot;.  I then spoke with a manager Alexis who apologized for the tub and said she would let the cleaning manager know.  She asked if she could give me 10,000 points and I said no, and that I needed to leave for my meeting. While I was out on business, my husband and daughter stayed at the hotel pool.  When they returned to the room, they found a small candy basket.  No note.  The room had a privacy sign on the door but they managed to let themselves in to the room to deliver a basket but they couldn't take the time to clean the mold and mildew.  I am waiting to check out on Sunday morning and a line is forming behind me.  I notice a lady staff member ask a group of guys two back from me if they need a receipt to check out.  She goes up to the desk and as she is on the computer looks up at me who is next in line and says &quot;oh, he can help you.&quot;  When it's my turn, I ask for a manager, and just my luck, it's the lady who passed me up to help the group of guys at the end of the line.  Then Trevor tells me, I have no balance and that they have comp'd the room charge.  Since I paid cash for the room, they are going to return the balance on my credit card on file.  OK.  As I am walking out, the lady manager who passed me up comes out after me asking what she can do to help.  I tell her about the mold, mildew, rudeness from staff regarding shampoo, no personal touch with the basket, and with her passing me up was just the finishing touch from this hotel.  Paula apologises and says she wants me to come back.  I said &quot;are you serious?&quot;  She says please give them another chance and she wants to give me voucher for a night stay.  I said fine and I wait while she goes in to get it.  She comes out and says the vouchers are in her car.  I wait.  Then she comes back to say she is all out and will mail one to me.  That was over a week ago and still no voucher.  I thought it was important for the general manger to know what happended during my stay so I called and left him a message on Tuesday.  No response.  I called and left him another message on Thursday.  On Friday, I get a call from Alexis asking what my issues are so that the GM, David can call me back.  Are you kidding?  His time is so important but mine isn't that I have to explain it to Alexis before I can discuss it with him.  But then what can I expect from the GM when the rest of his staff is so unprofessional.  I have checked my credit card and still no refund of the room charges.  I am now waiting for a call from accounting.  When will this nightmare end?  I never asked for a refund and now I am having to wait and follow up with something they decided to do!

It is wonderfully clean, well organised and nice bedrooms. I would thoroughly recommend staying here. I was initially a little wary of how to book in as it says there is no reception and you have to let them know when you are arriving but when we arrived earlier than we expected, there was someone to let us in and absolutely no problem. They do send an email a week before due arrival to tell them when to expect you as I dont think there is always someone there.They allowed us to take waters, yoghurts and fruit from the fridge and there is a lovely outside area.

Jean Prince did a wonderful job and we had no glitches despite using about 6-8 different venues in the hotel. The hotel food and coffee service were excellent.  The buffet breakfast simply should not be missed. The chamber maid service, the front desk staff, the bellhops and the wait staff are all highly trained, friendly and there to make your stay comfortable...hats off!The location is simply the best. You are at the immediate top of the old lower town and very close to Rue St. Jean / St. Louis as well. There is a Starbucks attached as well, too bad there is not a Tim Horton's or Second cup, more patriotic!Grab a burger at Le Chic Shack just down the hill past the tour buses, simply delicious burgers and poutin. The lower town is simply amazing. There are many great restaurants, do not forget to walk west in the lower town for many chic, more nouveau spots...the pizza at Piazetta was incredible. Panache at Auberge St. Antoine was also a culinary treat and the Artifact Lounge tour is worth doing...the property sits on a site where the ancestors, lived, worked and fought hundreds of years ago and there are many amazing artifacts displayed throughout this amazing property. I also loved the Citadelle, one of the coolest (and largest) military forts  you can still tour and it is an active base.I highly recommend Le Chateau Frontenac for a romantic getaway or your next event...wedding guests we ran into frequently were also very happy.A bientot!",1,0.4853157716987504

In other words..... very good value for money.THIS IS A WARNING. Its nothing to do with the hotel. When you turn right out of the front of the hotel, and then left on the covered walkway, you will come to Caffe Gambrinus. If you look it up on T.A. you will read that it rips off tourists ALL THE TIME, including us. You will see my review on there if you wish to read it and be more informed.Personally, I would advise you not to spend a penny there, as you will have hassle no doubt from the bandits who run it. Walk over the street, and on the right corner of the walkway is a great place with good prices, and good attitude and food. Sorry I forgot the name of the place.We will be going back to stay, as it is a good base for seeing the concerts in Lucca.A lovely special birthday treat for my wife to see the Eagles live, spoilt by the Gambrinus cafÃ© bandits. The staff at the hotel normally warn their guests about Gambrinus, but forgot with us. I think it stinks that a place like that can exist.

Very comfortable journey taking about 3hrs..costing around 190 CAD for a round ticket back to Trudeau airport.Chateau Frontenac is very imposing hotel that hovers at the top of Old Quebec city. We booked for four nights, a double room and on arrival upgraded to a recently refurbished room 3265 river view with extra space..our immediate thought when entering the room was...the original room booked must have been extremely small. Staying in many many hotels it is one of the smallest upgraded rooms we've stayed in. However, the decor and cleanliness was excellent. The river view was from the side so we did not actually overlook fully which was a little disappointing as we could only appreciate a small view, Comfortable beds and pillows.Excellent bathroom and good size.There was nothing we needed or had to ask for.Reception staff were excellent.

123780709,"A must stay if you are visiting Manchester.  I stayed in a superior double room (I think they call it a Grande studio) and loved it! You have a fully equipped kitchenette, a huge king sized bed, a mini seating area with a couch, a bathroom with a long deep bath (for all of you 6ft and over like we both are you can actually stretch out in it!!) and a shower with a huge shower head that gives the rain fall effect, ipod docking station, and free internet with the mac provided.  We took our own food and drink but if you forget they have  a mini pantry down stairs and breakfast is also included in the price (make sure you are down stairs before 10.30). Oh and the staff are lovely too.  I guess the only bad thing is the parking (I paid Â£19.40) and I have just read a review that says the staff give you a discount but I didn't know to ask for this :(.  Apart from that fab, gorge hotel, the Ibis next door is Â£30 cheaper but no breakfast and no luxury, the choice is yours :)",1,0.6359649122807017

Average room cleaning quality: greasy surfaces, stale tobacco smell in a non-smoking room.I don't know why anyone would want to stay here on a leisure trip.

436964736,"I was in Quebec for business and stayed one night here.  The hotel is housed inside of a former bank, but the interiors are all modernized, giving the space a unique feel.  The room itself was huge - way more than what I require for a one-night stay.  The ceiling was very tall which made the room seem very spacious.  Also, being up on the 7th floor, I had great views of the St Lawrence River.  The bathroom was also well-appointed, and I definitely had a great night's sleep on the comfy bed.  My colleagues and I took breakfast in the restaurant which is set up buffet-style with a spread of croissants, yoghurt and condiments, other breads, cold cuts, juices, and milk.  Coffee was available on request and made any way you want it.  And the location is perfect for those who are touring the historic city centre.

614233876,"We've been staying at the Town &amp; Country for a couple of decades and had an unexpectedly disappointing stay in April. Upon return my wife reached out via an online form and expressed our surprise and dismay. Almost immediately two good folks from T&amp;C, Annette Ross and Polina Vidrak contacted my wife and addressed the concerns. The fact that the two cared enough about our experience and their job spoke volumes. They were professional, timely, and great listeners as they suggested we give the hotel another shot. We did and couldn't be happier with the results. The attention to detail and care for their guests was above and beyond. We felt cared for and valued. That's what customer service comes down to, isn't it?Since then we've stayed twice more and are headed down this weekend with friends.  I rarely take the time to write reviews here but simply had to sing their praises. In an era of diminished customer service, Annette and Polina are a breath of fresh air. Their actions renewed our positive feelings in the property, and also in humanity. Being outstanding - and you better believe they were! - is a matter of a series of small efforts and attention to detail. The value of the stay based on the cost and service is tough to beat.

155030430,Loved my room on the 6th floor back tower! I found staying in the back tower made for a very quiet experience even though a high school prom was being held on the ground floor. This back tower also had its own parking 3 floor facility. The decor was very ornate and lots of attention to detail. The curtains were super fancy. There were multiple stacks of towels in all sizes.I ended up staying an extra hour to take a stroll throughout the beautiful facility and enjoyed taking it all in with the sound of singing birds from the nicely kept landscape.The only complaint I had was that a very nice housekeeping staff lady knocked on my door at 8:30AM(woke me up) to check if I was ready to leave (part of  customer service and charm?) When I checked out the nice front desk lady said I was supposed to leave a do not disturb(which they provide) card in the door slot. I suggested they should inform their guests about their policy of door knocking that early on a Sunday morning!! She agreed and waved my parking fee and even offer to have their driver take me to get coffee in their cafe/bakery...this place has its own baker!! and 4 or 5 restaurants/cafeterias...I would go back anytime!,1,0.5191304347826088

The en-suite was shower only, no bath, which was OK for me but if you want a soak in the bath after sightseeing you may want to request a room with bath. The free WiFi signal was also very good.Breakfast was pretty standard continental  fare but very nice &amp; plenty of it.If visiting Pisa again I wouldn't bother looking for anywhere else to stay as this ticked all the boxes. Also note that the hotel offers to beat any price if you book direct, If you do find a cheaper price they will beat it by 5 Euro's.

Did decline the club room which was an extra $20 a nights as I popped up to check it out &amp; it was a bit small &amp; did not seem good value, it would have guaranteed you a room on the 12th floor which had the added extra of a balcony &amp; use of the small club lounge but I guess it is up to each individual as to whether they would get value from it or not. Noise was never an issue but facing the freeway it might. I stayed over at Comfort  Suites last trip &amp; a bit noisy so big improvement.

The building is of historical interest and is situated on the river and probably quieter level of the city. The main city area is on a higher level and can be accessed via a funicular railway a little distance from the hotel. The railway operates throughout the day and evening and does get busy at times entailing a short wait. The hotel breakfast and bar have a nice ambiance but are quite expensive.

There were cop cars in the parking lot and lots of guys walking around the hotel but no one was staying there.

We stayed for four nights.Our room, which looked directly out onto the wall of the Musee de Civilisation across the street, was a reasonable size with freshly painted walls but rather tired looking furniture and floorboards which squeaked when walked on. The carpet square had definitely seen better days and the duvet cover was faded and marked.The window wall was open brickwork with a miscellany of pipe work (probably heating and a sprinkler system). The bathroom was small but clean, with minimal surface areas for toilet bags. Hanging space, number of hangers, drawer space and surfaces in the room itself were adequate. The lighting was somewhat sparse, however the air conditioning and bathroom shower worked well.Breakfast (included in the room rate) was waiter service of a choice from a very good menu plus orange juice and continually topped-up coffee. The service was friendly and swift; however the hot food wasnât very warm on the first morning. We also were slightly put off by the practice of the tip given by the occupant of a breakfast table being put back by the waiter, in clear view, onto the re-laid table and not cleared until he arrived to take the next occupantâs order (a very broad hint indeed).Overall we found the hotel to be reasonable value for the price paid, but we would look around for an alternative (even if higher priced) when staying in Quebec again.",0,0.4763306451612902

North tower is the side to stay on (views of the mountain are best!) and you are at the heart of everything Whistler has to offer.

A Stoney walkway with flowers and shrubs leading you into a large garden that at first sight takes your breath away. The old stone buildings makes you feel as if you have travelled back in time. The staff makes you feel very special the moment you step through the door and and all of them always tend to you with a smile on their face. I was there to celebrate a late birthday with my cousin having flown in from Scandinavia. We were both completely stunned at the beautiful setting of this spa and the rolling hills surrounding it. The flower gardens are out of this world and the zen like serenity that just enters your body the very minute you arrive. We had booked a one night stay and got the very cute canopy room. The day we were there was probably one of the hottest days in July so we had to have the air conditioning running the whole time which was the only negative I can think of. It was quite loud even though you could use different speeds and settings. Otherwise the room was wonderful and the lotions and potions provided in dispensers in the bathroom and in the change rooms in the main building was something we really enjoyed and used lots of all the time. We ate all our meals except dinner on the beautiful patio overlooking the pool and the garden. The afternoon tea and the breakfast was probably my favourite. There was lots to choose from and one could even choose items from different meals if something looked interesting. The teas and fresh juices were delightful and everything was very fresh and presented in a very tasteful way. Pleasing for both the palate and the eye. The 1 hour couples massage we had booked was very nice with aromatic oils to your choice. We both very much enjoyed our birthday celebration at St. Anne's and did not want to leave the next day. We ended up staying the entire day although we had to check out of our room at 11. The change rooms have lockers so you can leave your things there our put them in your car for the day. We swam 1000 m in the nice pool after breakfast and then had a great lunch,again on the patio. Spent the afternoon in the garden and towards the evening we enjoyed the hot tubs and the eucalyptus room. Bought some nice products from the gift store and headed back to Toronto reluctantly around 6pm in a state of total calm and with skin so incredibly  smooth from all the lotion. This is a place one HAS to visit at least once in your life. Everything is included in the price except gift store items and some wellness classes, other than that you don't need to even use your wallet during your stay. The toughest part was getting back to reality after two days having felt like royalty. St. Anne's....

I found this very disconcerting, they were kept in the pidgeon holes behind reception and returned to us when we checked out.The hotel was very basic and I wouldn't choose to stay there for longer than 2 nights. It is ideal for a short stay if you don't intend to spend much time at the hotel. No carpets and the shower was very weak. However, the hotel reception is 24/7 and the room had aircon. We couldn't get the pay TV to work. Basic continental breakfast but the waiter was very pleasant and keen to help. Checkout is at midday and the best thing for me was that they allowed us to leave our suitcase in a locked room on the ground floor after we had checked out until we were ready to go to the airiport (we had a late flight).

Our view was of the St. Lawrence River and the park, had tall windows to take in the view, and a lovely sitting area and mock fireplace. The hotel is iconic in itself, and I certainly felt that our room and its tasteful, classic-but-modern decor was iconic in itself and reflected the character and dignity of the hotel.We enjoyed the indoor pool and the steam room on a daily basis, and they were a lovely warm retreat from the cold March temperatures.We dined in the Bistro a couple of times and all enjoyed it.

It's on the main road but they provide ear plugs if your room is on the street side, so you can sleep.Breakfast is a funny affair.  If you were being charitable, you'd say it was urban.  If you were being realistic, you'd say that you take your chance with where you sit to eat it.  Some bar stools, some sofas, a few tables round the back, and a few random points where you can stand up.  A  bit like eating in a hotel lobby, which is essentially what it is.  If you fancied a sit-down at a table it might be possible if you can find somewhere.

Unfortunately some flaws became evident as we were getting ready to go out. Both bathroom and bedroom are very badly lit, making shaving, make-up etc very tricky! You can barely see your hand in front of your face. Dressing table is pointless as the plugs are at the wrong end so you have to stand up to use a hairdryer, which then means the mirror is positioned too low to be of any use. House keeping could be a little better also as some of the surfaces were dusty and some of the tiles in the bathroom had not been cleaned that well (but this could be down to the poor lighting!)The main complaint is the general noise from outside.

Train station are is a dodgy area with lots of people hanging about looking for change, drunks etc but thats standard for most cities they were a nuisance nothing more. Literally 10 minutes walk from leaning tower and other local sights to see are not far from the Guest-House. We stayed in a room with 2 bunk beds and nothing much else in there, was bathroom and shower was nice and hot (not guarenteed in some cheaper hotels!) but no kitchen or fridge to chill water before we went out.Basically its very well placed, cheap and simple so if thats what you need then this is a good shout as really in Pisa theres not much to do after a day or so exploring but the train goes to sienna, florence, lucca, livorno etc all wonderful towns/cities :-)",0,0.5082792207792207

So overall, I love the location! The room is small and divided into two section--living area (with pull out couch or another queen bed depending on room selection), and bedroom. I did not like the bedroom being by the hallway, the wall isn't thin but you can still hear people at night. The bathroom is nicely renovated recently, which was a big plus.

Also the air conditioning duct blew right down on the bed with no way to redirect the air flow.  Even with the fan at low speed, the breeze hitting the bed was annoying.

We have just returned from an amazing Italian adventure.  We booked this hotel in Pisa.  We specifically booked an upgrade river view as we stayed 6 years ago in a huge river view room. After 4 hours on the train from Rome we took a taxi to the hotel.  A very unconvincing receptionist told us that there was a problem with our room, they were fully booked so she had booked us into another hotel in Pisa.  There was no apology, no offer of someone to show us the way to the hotel or indeed help us with our bags???  There appeared to be no other option so we picked up our cases and walked some streets to find this back street hotel.The hotel room was tiny.  The bedding was stained.  The shower was dirty.  We couldn't put our valuables in the safe.  The view was into the building opposite.  This was such a disappointment.As we were staying in Pisa for only one night and by this time it was 5pm we simply had no choice but to stay there.  We did go back to tell the lady at Royal Victoria that this hotel room was not on a par with what we had booked, mostly so that she wouldn't do this to other guests.

There were lower priced hotels such as the Rodeway Inn but decided to try this one.  It was a nice place with nothing exceptional.  The room was nice and a little rustic.  Size of the room was reasonable and the bath/shower was fine along with television.  Internet access was around $10 and they had the normal make your own coffee pot.  We ate two meals at the restaurant (Tart) and they were a little expensive but very good and probably for the area, the price was reasonable.  Of course the main reason to stay here is location, location, location.  It is very convenient for attending the Price is Right show as you just go across the street at 6 a.m. to get your order of arrival tag, then at 8 get your ticket changed and 9 get in line for the 1 p.m. show.  Since you'll be there all day, it's nice to have the hotel just across the street.  For the Dancing with the Stars show, you have to walk to the other side of the CBS Studios but it would be the same as if you parked either at the Farmer's market or Grove since CBS has no public parking.  The Farmer's Market has changed to basically a cacophony of fast food restaurants so you can virtually find anything you want to eat there.  We ate twice at McGee's deli where the corn beef is just exceptional.  In addition, the new Grove shopping center is a real upscale mall along the line of Disney's &quot;Downtown&quot;  with a free tram which runs back and forth through the shopping area.  I would go back to Farmer's Daughter hotel because of the convenience and would recommend that others wanting to attend shows at the CBS studios consider this place.  If you've seen enough of LA and are there just for the shows, it's a great place as you can find everything you need by just walking.

We stayed in the 2 bedroom suite which was certainly big enough for the 4 of us--one of the kids slept out on the sofa bed--and the beds were pretty comfortable.  We could hear the ocean with the windows open (although we could also hear the street traffic early in the morning unfortunately but it wasn't a deal breaker).  The views from the deck over the cliffs were truly gorgeous and we just couldn't get enough of sitting and watching the sunset, the birds diving for fish, and the crashing waves.  My only complaint is that the floors of our room felt a little dirty--as if they hadn't been washed recently (maybe sand?)--and we wished we didn't feel the grittiness as we walked around barefoot. But as mentioned, the views and the beautiful gardens more than made up for it.  The location is also great--drove 5 minutes to great breakfasts in OB and was a short drive to anywhere else that we wanted to go in San Diego (and was a nice respite at the end of the days that we spent in the city).

I contacted TripAdvisor, but the response wasn't quick enough, so I had to delete my original review to have my personal information taken down.

I contacted the front desk multiple times and was told each time that they would look into it.  Each time, nothing happened.  I had an early flight, so I effectively got zero sleep that night, which really sucked.  To add insult to injury, the manager apologizing in my original review stated that it was an apartment complex next door and not their guests.  Total lie, as I saw the group of people in the Best Western parking lot sitting on cars.  Even worse, they lied further and stated that they reviewed security footage and there was no one there in the parking lot.  Again, I SAW THEM!  For HOURS!

AVwctAJvkufWRAb5yHGn,"I looked around quite a bit for a decent pet-friendly hotel, and this fit the bill nicely. Everyone is very nice and friendly. The hotel itself is very comfortable and nicely appointed. If you like modern hip vibe design, this is a good place to be. It's close to restaurants and the Japanese Friends Garden, a very large park next door (though not sure why they call it Japanese since nothing about it is Japanese). I only had drinks at the bar and chose to eat across the street at the Moroccan restaurant. The bartender was very knowledgeable and friendly. The only drawback about this hotel is the lack of sound proofing. My last morning (Saturday), I was woken very early by the person in the room next door with their music blaring. Also, the music from the bar is very, very loud, and there were several people hanging outside the lobby in front of their car with their music turned up so loud it was shaking the windows. My poor dog was so scared. Also, I was gone all day the first full day there, and came back at 830pm to find my room still had not been cleaned. Minor inconvenience.Hi! Thank you for taking the time to write a review! Glad to hear you and your pup had a comfortable stay. There are actually two parks next to us, and you were most likely in Hance Park, not the Japanese Friendship Garden as there is a fee and the grounds there are built and landscaped just as they are in Japan. Perhaps on your next stay we can get you pointed in the right direction. As far as the noise issues you experienced, we are already looking in to ways we can improve this. We apologize for any inconvenience it may have caused for you and your dog. We will also address the issue with your room to see why it hadn't been cleaned while you were away. Again, thanks for this review and we will use it to improve and hopefully see you again in the future.",1,0.4725202821869489

Free Wi-Fi with Gold (otherwise you pay), free non-alcoholic beverages in the lounge all the time, yummy free breakfast (with hot items), and free happy hour of sorts with hors d'oeuvres.

526993472,"VERY ARCHAIC CIRCULATING HEATING SYSTEM THAT NEVER TURNS OFF. POLYESTER BLEND SHEETS AND POLYESTER DUVETS. HOT AND SWEATY!!! We stayed at this place September 9-12 2017. Checking into the Hotel is a nightmare...there really aren't any signs directing a customer where the hell to go. The Hotel was under construction during our stay, but, we were not bothered by any noise. After checking in and receiving instructions as to park, we searched for the underground parking structure. We were certain we must have misunderstood what the clerk had told us. The direction took us thru a construction site...just as we were turning around we noticed another vehicle approach a plain white closed garage door...AGAIN NO SIGNAGE. The garage opened and the vehicle entered. We followed and the door opened and there was construction debris litter scattered on the ground. AGAIN NO SIGNAGE as where to enter. We unloaded our car and pet and had to carry our luggage trying to figure out which elevator to take...and there were zero employees to ask for directions. Once we found our room and opened the door...the temperature inside was at least 85 degrees Fahrenheit. I looked for the thermostat and didn't find one. I immediately called the front desk and was told that only the main part of the Hotel had air-conditioning. After complaining, the manager on duty moved us to the air-conditioned section. This room was also oppressingly hot, but had two wall air units. For three nights we had to leave the windows wide open because the units only made noise and produced zero cool air. This Hotel has one main circulating heat system throughout the entire Hotel. You have no choice as to what temperature is comfortable for you. Even with the windows open 24 hrs a day...it NEVER COOLS OFF. Management told us that they are working on the problem and had received brand new air conditioning units that were defective and had to be returned and were waiting for the new units to be delivered. The owners of this Hotel should be ashamed for even taking money from people.",-1,0.5085394763966193

132606199,"Myself and a mate visited Terrenia and we stayed at the Grand Hotel Continental. Yes, the hotel is slightly dated and looks quite 1970's. Regardless on the hotel looking dated I had a great time staying there. The staff are so friendly and accomadating and helpful. It was very rare that a staff member never said hello or smiled when passing them in the hotel. The rooms are a good size with twin beds, decent size bathroom/shower rooms. Fresh towels every day, sheets changed every other day I think. The cleaners were very nice and friendly. We must not forget the cleaners, they are important too. TV in the room on the wall and wi-fi available from two euros for two hours, which the minutes only decrease when you use the wi-fi. If you don't use it the minutes remain until you do use it. The name with the title of the hotel is Grand - and it certainly is. Please, please don't be put off by the look of the hotel from the outside, and it isn't a 2012 decor, but it certainly is Grand and very clean inside. At the front of the hotel there is a street of markets opposite the hotel. Most of them sell the same items, but be warned that when you approach the market they pester you to buy something. That really annoyed me, but barter with them with a price.The hotel poolproudly sports an amazing Olympic size swimming pool, sometimes too cold for me, but when using the pool or private beach to the hotel, fresh towels were issued from the very lovely friendly staff by pool side. One of the nicest staff member there was Jr. He was very friendly and always smiling. Again the staff where very friendly and quite chatty.The beach was the cleanest beach area that I have chilled on. All beach areas to indevidual hotels were private and only people at the hotels can only use that particular beach area. A black guy on the Continentals private beach would escort you to the Grand Continental area, he would clean the litter from the beach and he was always keeping a watchful eye out for any possible issues. Very chilled beach.The food.The food was nice and filling. You would begin with a buffet of many selections, then a starter, then the main, then a sweet. The portions were very generous and the restaurant staff were very friendly, accomadating, chatty and helpful. My fav' waitress was the very lovely Melissa.BreakfastVery good selection of food hot and cold. Plenty of food and something for everyone to start their day.Overall...

Not your normal, run-of-the-mill business hotel but one with a bit of character right in the heart of Manchester surrounded by great Chinese restaurants. I received a warm and professional welcome on arrival - efficient service delivered with a smile. The first room I was given was a little too close to Reception for my liking so Erdal on Reception was really helpful and proactive in checking what else was available and finding a stellar room for me on the fourth floor instead. What a view! The rooms are really well laid out and if you're working away on business, this place is great as you can do some self catering on those evenings when all you fancy is something simple like beans on toast!    One last point:  Parking close by in Q Park is also very easy and convenient (3 mins walk to the hotel) and you get a 30% discount card from the hotel which you use in conjunction with your car park ticket.

Why make a reservation if I'm not guaranteed the room I chose. I just might look at another location before booking with T&amp;C Resort Hotel.      ,1,0.3857142857142857

At midnight or just after we could not stand it any more, we thought it might quieten down, but no, it just seem to get worst. The rude man on the desk said there was no more rooms he could allocate, I felt he just could not be bothered! We stayed at this hotel in the summer and was on first floor and had no issues.

184630619,"This was our third visit to Ste Anne's and we will continue to return (at least) every year.  It's hard to know where to begin.FoodEverything is delectable.  The menus are creative and use locally grown / raised ingredients whenever possible.  We tend to order whatever the 'specials' are for that meal but also love the almond flour pancakes on the breakfast menu.  It is easy to overeat though, and with 4 meals per day, you might want to order less at each than you might elsewhere or you might feel always a little too full!Spa TreatmentsThe Signature Facial is very high quality and my skin always looks great for weeks after.  On my most recent visit, I tried the Moor Mud Wrap.  I must say, I don't relax easily but my entire body was mush by the end of this treatment.  (I think I was even drooling!)  It's a very creative service that combines many components of other spa treatments.  My husband always gets both the hand and foot treatment and thoroughly enjoys them both.Wellness ClassesOn my recent visit, I tried the gentle yoga and the regular yoga.  Both instructors were exceptionally well trained and responsive to the needs of the class.  Classes have about 12 people in them of varying ability.  If you're new to yoga, don't be intimidated.  If you're not, the instructors will find an appropriate level of challenge for you.AccommodationsLast winter we stayed in the Games Room.  I would recommend in the winter, when you can't really use the outside areas of the property, to get a room like this one with a couch or expanded seating area.  The one downside of this room is that fitness classes walk by your main window to get from the waiting room to the fitness room.This Thanksgiving weekend, we stayed in the Blue Room.  As the weather was wonderful we spend very little time in it.  Basically, each room at the spa is unique and has its trade-offs.CostIt's not cheap, but get over it.  The spa allowance is per person, per day, and can be used towards spa treatments or wellness classes.  The mid-week rate is lower than the weekend rate.  Last minute deals are advertised on their website and on SpaLotto.  On my last visit, I called about an advertised last-minute sale on the cottage rooms but inquired about other vacancies and got mid-week prices on a deluxe room in the main building on a weekend.  I have never walked away from Ste. Anne's regretting the amount of money I'd spent.",1,0.4858367132867133

AVwcgshl_7pvs4fzv3ge,"My family and I were surprised at just how good this place is. Given its location right in the heart of Seattle Center and its affordability, we thought for sure something was amiss. Parking in the area is expensive, here it is 25/day with full in/out privileges in a protected garage. The rooms are spacious, with a kitchen (microwave, stove, full fridge/freezer, sink, etc.) with an elevated dining table. Add the spacious bedroom, bathroom, and sitting area and you have a comfortable place for four to stay. The full breakfast is above average but the real hidden gem is the H Bar. We ate here a couple of times and the food is outstanding. The happy hour features a good selection of 3 local tap beers and the place is never really crowded. I'm not sure the tourists know they can come in otherwise I could imagine thirsty and hungry tourists at Seattle Center walking the minute or two to here, having a beer and a bite, and easily going right back to the Space Needle. I searched for the H Bar on Trip Advisor, but it's not there.

113336241,"I had the extreme good fortune to be sent to Ste. Anne's spa for a two night visit back in February.  My sister-in-law and I shared the &quot;Wicker&quot; room in the main building of the Ste. Anne's complex.  Despite the fact that it was the deep of winter, the spa was fully booked, yet it did not feel overcrowded by any means!  We had planned far ahead and booked all of our treatments at least a full month in advance and so were able to get everything we wanted...don't leave this to the last minute as you may be disappointed.The grounds, even in the middle of winter, were beautiful and so peaceful with a covering of snow, and we fully appreciated lodging in the main building as we were literally able to stay in our robes all day, breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  What a treat!  And no one looks askance at you if you show up for lunch with &quot;spa hair&quot;!!  Do try and remember your sandals or flip flops for getting around, although they do sell some in the gift shop if you forget, or you can wear the ones provided in your welcome kit.  Our room was tucked away up a &quot;secret&quot; staircase accessed through the quiet reading room or the dining area.  The building is very old and our room was decorated to maintain that feeling, with a comfortable queen bed and a single in one large dormer type room with an attached bathroom.  Be forewarned that there are no televisions or phones in your room, but you won't feel the lack!  Everything was clean and well maintained and the turndown service even closed the wood shutters at night to ensure privacy and darkness!I was a bit apprehensive about eating at the spa as I am both wheat and dairy allergic, but I really should have done my homework because I have not eaten so well since I've been diagnosed!  The menus, which offer a good variety, indicated allergens for each item, and over the seven meals we enjoyed I only repeated coffee and tea and the excellent almond crust âpizza.â  Everything was delicious, fresh, often organic, and of a very high calibre.  Iâm told the afternoon âcream teaâ is amazing, but couldnât partake for obvious reasons, so I stuck to the delicious, homemade hummus and bean dips!The main reason for going to a spa is obviously the treatments and Ste. Anneâs does not disappoint in this area either.  The Earth Stones Facial was the highlight of all the treatments that I tried (four in total) and should not be missed.  Iâve never experienced that level of pampering during a facial.   Generally the products used during treatments were Aveda and included Aveda aromatherapy singular notes to help enhance whatever you are having done.  They also have a small shop where you can purchase all things Aveda to take home with you.Finally, I would like to mention my two absolute favourite features of Ste. Anneâs spa: the activites, and the Eucalyptus Steam Room.  I signed up for Yoga classes for all three days that I was at the spa.  The yoga instructor was excellent and no two classes were the same; in fact they were somewhat foundational for those of us who were at the spa for the whole weekend, building on previous classes.  By far my favourite activity however, was sitting in the Eucalyptus Steam Room...it is worth the trip to Grafton just to use the Steam Room.  The heat, the scent; you could feel your pores opening up just walking in the door.  I loved it!  And there was something magical about running from the Steam Room to the outdoor hot tub overlooking the snow covered hills and then jumping into the icy plunge pool and starting over from the beginning again.  Amazing.  Iâve heard the gardens are not to be missed in the summer time, but for me, the stillness and peace of Ste. Anneâs in the winter will be what draws me back next year.",1,0.5185851493139628

I hadn't checked to see what the parking arrangements were, but was amazed when I discovered that the only parking available was in the nearby retail park. I was uneasy about this but the staff assured us that there had never been a problem. Try telling that to the poor American family who woke on Sat morning to find their car window had been smashed and their holiday gear stolen. Or to the Scottish couple (who had used the hotel previously without incident) but also woke up to a smashed rear window and stuff stolen. Three cars had been damaged - all the result of the town's biggest night club being 200 metres away and revellers wandering down the hill and through the public car park. When staff tell me this is 'not a problem', I don't believe them. I wonder how often the Police are to be found in the hotel lobby dealing with these incidents.The room was ludicrously hot and stuffy, the road facing window opened only a fraction, but this of course was pointless as opening the window only served to let the yelps and screeches of the passing late night revellers disturb any sleep we could grab.

Earlier on  when we had checked in we had requested for the sofa bed to be made for our daughter while we went out; when we got back after a couple of hours the bed was not made we had to call twice for someone to come with the bedding. The person who eventually did come to make the bed left the heavy cushions and pillows scattered all around the room. The blanket used to make the bed has pilling and is full of lint, it does not seem clean at all. The sofabed itself is very uncomfortable, saggy in some places and metal springs poking out in others. We had to put the big cushions on it to make it sleepable, needless to say it's lumpy and uneven now. This is turning out to be a really bad experience.We had booked the Auberge Saint-Antoine through American Express we choose it over the Fairmont because we thought it will be more service oriented, less commercial and have a quieter surrounding. Though these are the BIG negatives so far , to be fair I must say we had a positive experience with the concierge staff they were very courteous and helpful giving us directions to places for site seeing and recommendations of restaurants. Even giving us a room upgrade ( which now I wish I hadn't asked for).

Because of where we live we are on the road a lot and have stayed in a lot of motels... because we have a dog we usually have to pay extra and are put in some of the worst rooms.  This really bothers me because when we leave our room you would never know we had had a pet in there.

AVwdouC6ByjofQCxrEh-,"We stayed here for 9 days for vacation purposes, so we experienced pretty much everything this hotel has to offer.It's location is great. It is right in front of Lake Union. Ask for a room looking towards the lake (floors 5 or higher): you will be rewarded with beautiful sunrises and sunsets. You will also see people kayaking and swimming. And Kenmore Air departs for its water seeing tours from there, so you can see plane lift ups and water landings: cool!As though that was not enough, you are 1 mile away from Seattle Center (Space Needle, EMP Museum, Chihuli Gardens, etc).We had a car, so it was nice to find plenty of parking, even for SUVs. Unfortunately you will be charges 27/day.Rooms are very comfortable. The staff (all of it: reception, restaurant, housekeeping) makes a point of acknowledging customers in one way or another every time they see you. And Whenever you request something they deliver it rather quickly, regardless of the hour. The hotel has a swimming pool and a hot tub. Small both of them, but good enough.The restaurant is open for breakfast and dinner only. No complaints on the service: very good. Breakfast offerings are fine: from healthy choices (oatmeal, yogurt with granola, fruits, etc) to more elaborate ones. Variety is limited but decent and it is all prepared rather fast. Dinner options were not attractive to us. We found them a bit over priced for the quality and quantity. However, the hotel has a small market where you can find a few things to eat, assuming you do not want to go out for dinner.A few blocks away from the hotel there is a Starbucks and a McCormick Schmick's restaurant, both of them with waterfront viewing. And about 5 blocks away there is a Bartell drugs where you can find medicines, regular snacks and a few more sophisticated options (salads, Gouda cheese, prosciutto and good crackers, etc).All in all: great place to stay. I highly recommend it.",1,0.5997881397881398
60004504,"Weâve just returned from a week-long holiday in Pisa and want to add our thanks to the many letters of praise already posted by other Trip Advisor members about Micheleâs splendid B&amp;B.Others have already noted the help and support they received from Michele and Giada (his housekeeper), the comfortable and clean accommodation (we were a party of three in the double and single Florence rooms) and the remarkable breakfasts, so weâll focus on a few specific instances of why we were so pleased with our treatment.Weâd already asked Michele, by email, to book us somewhere to eat when weâd checked in after our arrival at Pisa airport. Our early evening flight was delayed though, and so we arrived at the bus station near the B&amp;B about an hour late. Weâd just started to walk in the general direction of the B&amp;B when Michele appeared and asked if we were his expected guests â heâd called the airport, found out what had happened and was here to help. Ten minutes to leave our things and he was leading the way to a busy Pizzeria (packed with local families enjoying Saturday night out), the staff of which he had already briefed. Needless to say, we did not go to bed hungry!!On Sunday morning we were taken aback by the quality and service of Giadaâs splendid breakfast, the excellent cappuccino and the special cake to finish it all off. After that, we received the benefit of  Micheleâs thorough knowledge of the Tuscan hinterland and where best to eat - his âbriefingâ was comprehensive and well-aimed (bearing in mind that English is not his first language); again, it was what we had asked for and it enabled us to get the best out of our time in the area.Since Wednesday was likely to be the best day, weather wise, we reserved it for Cinque Terre (which would be totally dependent on train travel).  However on arrival at Florence the day before we learned of a regional 24 hour train strike from 7 p.m. that evening which threw our plans into disarray. Catching an earlier train back to Pisa we were relieved to discover that Michele had second-guessed our movements and was ready with alternative proposals. Once we had eaten â yes, he had rearranged that too! â he suggested a bus-trip to Calci and its historic Certosa (Chapterhouse) and helped us with timetables and getting tickets. When we arrived, we found that he had rung ahead and asked if a guide with some English would be available; that wasnât possible, but we got by and had a truly memorable experience which was one of the highlights of our Pisa visit.With another fair day forecast and the trains restored we chose to visit Cinque Terre on the following day, but it would have been beyond us to arrange it in the short time available without Micheleâs help with a Eurostar train booking (to make an early start) and the complex Cinque Terre itinerary and ticketing. As it turned out, this was probably the most memorable day of our holiday â it was certainly the most exhausting, and thatâs without our visit to Lucca and two wonderful days spent in Florence!Our host was generous with his time and his help and support throughout our stay, and we are in no doubt that our holiday was a success because he helped us to make good choices of what to do and where to go. We werenât his only guests, yet he and Giada seemed to offer the same quality service to everyone. Mille grazie, Michele e Giada â we shall return for some more of your hospitality (and splendid breakfasts) as soon as possible!!",1,0.5067012288786483

401089888,"We stayed here over Christmas, expecting to be immersed in Christmas spirit, but we were disappointed!  The hotel is impressive from the outside, but less so on the inside, and it lacks the intimacy you might expect in a luxury hotel - in fact, its very impersonal. The room was reasonably well appointed and clean, and the view was OK, but the spotlight shining across the window at night was a bit off-putting; at least blackout blinds were fitted!!! We booked the Christmas Gourmet Supper, and were very disappointed. It wasn't gourmet and felt more like a children's christmas party.  The Frontenac Team were  very sympathetic and dealt with the issue retrospectively, but it didn't really compensate for what should have been (and what was advertised as) a special evening. One final thing - internet - we got charged for using it in our room, when the general public can use it for free on the lower floors - crazy!  They did refund the charge, but come on, this is an expensive hotel that should include internet access as standard - like nearly every other reasonable hotel!

Lifts often had a strong smell of cigarette smoke, possibly down to guests smoking near the entrance and then entering the lifts which were about 10 paces away? (The hotel DID appear to be using air fresheners to counter this). If you want a continental type breakfast then you'll be fine but the cooked options were limited to beans, scrambled eggs and some cheap and nasty sausages, best not to even offer anything cooked if that's all they're putting on. The bar (over Â£4 for a bottle of cider and Â£5+ for a 35cl Brandy) closed at 11:45 so if you're looking for a late drink make sure you're in before then as they appeared to be quite strict on this.

(Our cruise ship was parked in port, and we could have an already paid-for lunch on the ship, which we wanted to pass up to get some of the local culture.) So, at 12:30 p.m. on Oct. 5, we appeared, sans reservation, at the Bistro Le Sam (the hotel's very fancy coffee shop.)  Per the head waitress there were no available tables until 2:00 pm.  That's despite the fact that we could see empty tables and no one waiting anywhere near the narrow entryway.  A fact we called to her attention.  She referred us to Place Dufferin in the hotel, down one flight.  So we went to Place Dufferin, a large restaurant overlooking the St. Lawrence.  And filled with about 100 Japanese tourists on a tour.  But Place Dufferin is not open to the public for lunch, just to tour groups.  The headwaiter at Place Dufferin told us to go back to Bistro Le Sam, saying he had just sent people up there, and there were tables available.Of course, as we were not hotel guests, that meant going outside and walking around the hotel as there was a security door keeping us from a direct route only accessible by hotel guests.Back to Bistro Le Sam.  Now there were even more tables visibly available, and several small groups passed us leaving the restaurant.  No one was waiting.  And the same head waitress studied her charts and notes on her podium, and, once again, said 2:00 p.m. was the earliest we could fit in.The bar was not open until 2:00 p.m.So we left, and had lunch at a fine place in town.Why they didn't want our money is a puzzlement.  Why the Bistro Le Sam head waitress would send us to another restaurant in the hotel that was not open for the public is a puzzlement.  How the head waiter at Place Dufferin managed to figure out Bistro Le Sam had space when the head waitress, ignoring available evidence, said there was none, is another puzzlement.",0,0.3266931216931217
48129631,"This hotel has a great location, but the rooms need to be renovated. The first room we stayed in had torn carpet, burn marks on the furniture, and a shabby bathroom. The sheets and toilet seemed clean, but everything else in the room was dusty and dirty.  The second room we stayed in was in the same shape and the one our friends stayed in had mystery stains all over the carpet. The beds and pillows were hard and uncomfortable (I don't usually notice beds, but these were bad). The worst part of our stay was when the couple in the room next to us had loud sex (screaming, banging, etc.) and due to the paper thin walls it sounded like they were in the room with us. After blasting our TV to try to cover up the noise we called down to the front desk and they said they would ask them to quiet down but unfortunately that didn't work. We switched rooms to be away from that couple. The second night we were woken up by the sound of another couple having sex, but at least this couple wasn't trying to break any records for noise and duration. We slept horribly and were grossed out but I can't imagine how bad it would be for someone travelling with kids to have to hear that. This hotel needs to do some soundproofing since they aren't billing themselves as a youth hostel and are charging more than $120 a night.",-1,0.5062757201646091

The hotel's facebook page indicates they are refurbishing the rooms, it would appear that our room (125) was still to be done. The room was clean but the bed was very hard and it squeeked. The bathroom had a shower over the bath but the shower screen didn't stop the floor being soaked every time we used the shower. There was only one electric socket in the bedroom and our adapter didnt fit in it so I had to charge my mobile in the bathroom using the socket the hairdryer was plugged into and this only worked when the light was switched on.

Great location if you are there for days or weeks at a time. There is a boardwalk on the side of the hotel, and you could walk down or take a tram down to old Quebec City. Lots and lots of sight seeing to do in Quebec City. As far as the rooms go, they are very classic but dated. My rooms was not that appealing at all. It's in a corner of the hotel, my closet was bigger than my washroom. The window I had in the room was about 5 ft high so you could not see the city at all. The bed is comfortable and being at the end of a hallway, it's quiet. Starbucks in the lower level of the hotel but it is quite costly, so be prepared to pay a minimum of $2 premium to you regular drinks. The most annoying thing at this hotel was, the 2 card keys you must carry with you at all times. 1 card is for the room and the other for the elevators, I forgot my room key on the second night of my stay. The running joke was, if there is a line up at the front desk at night, it's because everyone has forgotten their key card in the room.

278626178,"My husband and I visited the Chateau Frontenac for business and stayed there one extra night for pleasure.  We had also visited the Auberge Saint Antoine and we preferred Auberge Saint Antoine to this Hotel.  If you are going there by car you must take the valet service for your car because the parking lot is so tight and if you have a mini van it is truly very challenging to get to your parking spot. If you do not take the valet service you will be stuck bringing your luggage down the stairs on your own as their are no elevators from the indoor parking to the lobby of the Hotel. On top of this the parking per night can go up to 38$ per night, so keep this in mind if you will be coming to this hotel with your car.  The Hotel is beautiful and our room 4138 was a room facing the garden. We did not opt for a room facing the city as it was super $$$$.  The temperature in the room was perfect and the room was very quiet. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was a little small but fine for our business stay.   We were on business and the food that we had at all of our lunches was great.  The waiters were very friendly and gave a great service, always.  My husband and I visited the terrace on the 6th floor but we did not try the indoor pool.  The terrace is very nice and there are many lounge chairs to relax. There is a very basic gym.My favorite thing about this hotel was its location. It is located near restaurants and in the center of Old Quebec.  I am not sure if is the center but if felt very close to everything we wanted to do in Old Quebec.  I would go back but I would not pay more than what I paid (about $300 per night) for a future visit.  I was told that my rate was low compared to the rates on high season which can go up to $600 per night. If you are looking for a location for a large group ex: 300 guests, then this is a great option.  The conference rooms are beautiful, the food is great and the staff waiters are very friendly and always ready to take care of you.  Although there are 650 rooms and the hotel was very busy when we were there, we felt as if it was not busy whenever we were on our floor on our way to our room.

220667034,"Staying at the Chateau Frontenac was a dream come true.  It is hard to know where to begin to write about this amazing place.To start with, the location of the Chateau is ideal.  It is located on the St. Lawrence River, with a wonderful boardwalk right outside.  On the boardwalk you can find excellent street performers (that range from opera singers to circus acts), the Funicular (a special elevator that takes you from upper Old Quebec City to Lower Old Quebec City in minutes), and an archeological dig located underneath the boardwalk that can be explored.  Many of the attractions of Quebec are within walking distance of the hotel as well.  If walking is not your style, you can also take advantage of the several bus/tour companies that stop right outside the building or take a taxi (they are parked directly outside the main entrance and a bellman will assist you).  The Chateau's reputation is well earned when it comes to customer service.  Everyone in the hotel - front desk, bellman, room attendants, security, concierge - was helpful and took every request seriously.   My friend hurt her leg and required an ice pack at 11:00pm; it was brought up to the room by security within less than 5 minutes.  When I needed to change money, the front desk was kind enough to inform me that their exchange rate was not quite as good as to what I would be able to get outside the hotel; that way I could decide if I wanted to exchange my money there or wait until we went out.  On our check-out day, the bellman was kind enough to bring us two bottles of cold water for our trip home.  It was these kind of small amenities that made our stay extra special.The room itself was beautiful.  It was one of the smaller rooms, but the view was breathtaking!  The bed was more comfortable than my bed at home, and each bed had four fluffy down pillows.  It was kept very clean and well stocked.  If we needed something (like extra towels), it was brought right away.  It was also very quiet - there was little noise despite how busy the hotel was.  The concierge was excellent.  From the time the reservation was made, the concierge answered questions over the telephone and sent very useful information about tours and dining by e-mail.  The other thing that was very helpful - everyone in the hotel spoke English to a certain degree, which was a blessing because my French is limited to the basic polite phrases.  This was a special once-in-a-lifetime trip for me, and I am so glad I had an opportunity to stay at the Chateau Frontenac!  I highly recommend it if you are going to Quebec City!",1,0.4860685941043084

The Golden Acres room, and also the Pondview, are located upstairs with a private entrance, so very quiet. Also really lovely furniture and a bed that is wonderfully comfortable.2. There is a fantastic guest kitchen on the lower level. There is a full fridge, stove, microwave, toaster and dishwasher. The kitchen is fully stocked with cutlery, dishes and cooking tools. To me this is a huge bonus, as we often make small meals when away. 3. The place is more like an Inn than a B&amp;B, lots of different places to sit outside without bumping shoulders with everyone else. When we stayed, it was fully booked, and yet we had the entire back patio to ourselves. Also the &quot;sunset cottage&quot; is a beautiful sitting room for guests, really very lovely with a definite &quot;cottagey&quot; feel to it. If I had the room to build one I would. Gorgeous view of the sunsets.4. The location is excellent- only a few km to get to onto the 403, and maybe a 6 or 7 minute drive into Ancaster, and 15 minutes to the waterfront in Hamilton Harbor.As everyone else has stated, the hosts are excellent and Shelby the dog is very well behaved, and well, just adorable.

184809936,"Stayed here for an educational conference in November. Had previously stayed back in the Spring for conference planning. Back in the Spring had a nice king bedded 4 post bed in the tower. When I came back this Fall, I was told I was in the 2 level building and only had double beds (no king) available even though I was one of the first to check in for the week and was part of the conference planning committee (had even mentioned that in the reservation). I had even paid extra on the conference website for a tower room! Went to the room and had to climb a flight of stairs with 2 maxed out check-in bags (no elevators) Got to the room 3776 and really felt like I got the bait and switch. Couldn't switch right away as I had back to back meetings that I couldn't miss. Room was small compared to the Spring and the bathroom ceilings are like 7 feet tall. Felt like I was in a Laura Ingalls dollhouse with decor to match. I had a corner room  but next to the housekeeping closet. They went in at all hours especially after 8pm. Quite noisy even though I left the do not disturb sign out. I also was above what seemed to be the employee office punch in area. I think they all gathered around to smoke as I kept smelling it up in my room and when I went out, it looked like employees milling around and smoking. Internet kicked me out 2 out of the three days I bought it so complained and they refunded the fee (however it was a work trip so internet needed to work). Housekeeping wouldn't replace the toiletries on a daily basis even though it was clear I was using up the shampoo every day; had to ask when I saw one of the carts later. Had to leave a note to have the batteries replaced in the TV as it didn't work (at least they did that promptly). Didn't have breakfast as I heard from colleagues it was pricey so made a stop on my daily run to the AM/PM about 10 minutes away for take home breakfast. Didn't want to spend the $5 a day for the gym (that seemed to be the mantra as I saw many colleagues running every morning). Wifi cost $8  day but didn't work for two of the days. On the day I departed I needed to catch an early shuttle and requested a 4am wake up call. Never rang so thank goodness for iphone and ipad alarms. When I did depart the lobby was closed and you had to ring to get in. Had to wait 10 minutes before someone let me in. Colleague had a car and she had to pay for parking. Only thing this hotel had going for it was the proximity to the mall and trolley. But guess what, the Marriott across the freeway that I thought was not foot accessible has an underpass (other colleagues stayed there) so I will be definitely staying at the Marriott next time. Maybe if the T&amp;C would have honored my reservation of being in the Tower  it would  have made my stay better but it was a big time fail this time.",-1,0.2842985842985843

We went down to the front desk got the coupon went back up and she said okay you have it but NEVER even looked at it we could have shown her a fake card she would have never have known she jsut made it inconfience for us to eat.

151486081,This was our second time staying at this hotel and we love it every time.  We stayed for a week and I couldnt have asked for a better trip.  There were 5 of us and we stayed in unit 305 which is a 2 bedroom 1 bath unit with a private hot tub.  The only negative I can really say was that the second bedroom was not very big at all and had no window.  It would also get very hot in that room.  The kitchen was great.  Had everything we needed.  We did send in the grocery list and they had it delivered and put away before we had arrived. Next time though I think we would just go to the grocery store when we get there.  Its not too far of a walk.  One of the best parts of this hotel is its location.  Just outside the hotel is the 2 gondolas.  After a day of boarding the last thing I wanted to do was walk through the village to get to our hotel.  This hotel couldnt be any closer.  Absolutely love this hotel!,1,0.4315883190883191
120321894,We loved this place. The service was great and it is relatively cheap.  It is an easy walk to the centre of the city and the Lungomare with escalators back up the steep hills. The 3 people who run this B&amp;B also have another B&amp;B and so are not on the premises the whole time.The owners emailed us to find out when we expected to be there and arranged a taxi to pick us up from the station ( driven by the elegant and ever cheerful Antonella) and to take us to the ferry when we left. The building looks as though it was a shop and residence before being extensively renovated.The room was large and beautifully decorated ( each room has a different colour scheme) with a very comfortable bed and couch. The bathroom also had plenty of room and towels. The breakfast is self-service with a very pleasant courtyard to eat in. Free internet and DVD's in the foyer and good restaurant suggestions are thrown in for free. We had the best fish meal in Italy in Reggio on Sergio's recommendation,1,0.6372619047619048
117131767,"I have to say, I'm amazed that this hotel rates number one in Pisa?! It's ok ... but nothing special.The hotel is situated a long way out of the city, and is in the middle of nowhere! So unless you have a car, or are willing to pay big taxi prices, you've not much to do when you get there.The rooms are clean, but small. The bathrooms are pretty well equipped. Make sure you ask for a quiet room away from the lifts though, as otherwise you could be woken up throughout the night by the noise from the lift.The restaurant is ok. And the bar looks great - especially if the weather's nice, and you can sit in the garden. But because there's not much choice in the area for places to eat or drink, so the prices in both the restaurant and bar are not cheap to say the least! We paid 18 Euros for ONE cheese sandwich and two wines.The hotel has special room rates for hospital visitors (the hospital is just across the road), and for business people. So you can pick up last minute rooms at around 100 - 140 Euros. But be aware that you'll probably end up paying much more than that with the extras you're charged!If you want to use the internet, try to ensure your rate includes internet access. It's not free otherwise, and again, it's NOT cheap.They say that there's a free shuttle bus to the airport - but beware! It only operates in certain hours, and you have to ensure it's not pre-booked. We tried to book it at check-in for the next day, but were told that it wasn't going to be available for us, and that we would have to pay for a taxi instead. 15 Euros extra!The website also states that there's free parking on-site. But when you get there, you have to pay 20 Euros to park in the hotel car park. There is free parking outside the hotel, but if you don't get there early you could miss out as it only has limited spaces.Also, if you're leaving the hotel before 7am, don't bother booking Bed and Breakfast. Even though, when you check-in, they may promise a take-away breakfast will be with you prior to 7am the next morning, they didn't deliver it for us as the kitchen was closed!In short, if you're only using the hotel as a base for the airport, and only there for a few hours, you'll be fine. But if you're wanting a nice hotel, with some atmosphere, and better value for money, there are definitely nicer places to stay in and around Pisa.",-1,0.5283245149911817

620092891,"Wonderful relaxing stay. Great location only a few minutes from the train station and the supermarkets, and not too far to walk to the tower either. I had a single room so it was through the outdoor corridor (only a few steps away from reception) which meant I had more privacy, as I didn't have to walk through reception to leave and arrive. Keys are in the form of cards so you don't have to hand them in. Room was fine, coffee and kettle, minibar with free water, plenty of plug sockets including one right by the bed. Bring earplugs though; could hear every moan and groan from the neighbouring rooms!Breakfast was wonderful; it's open until 10:30, I always went down a little before 10 and there was still plenty of food left; there was a machine with oranges to make freshly squeezed orange juice, another machine that made pancakes, plus cakes, pastries (although these were always gone by 10), hot chocolate, fruit salad, cereals, scrambled eggs and Italian bacon. Delicious!On the negative side: All the electricity cuts out when the card is not in its slot inside the room, so you can't charge electronics while you're out, which is annoying (could potentially get around this by leaving a credit card in the slot while you're out!). What spoilt the stay for me was, the cleaners took the 'Do Not Disturb' sign off my door and came in anyway, every day of my stay. I even went to reception to ask that they did not come into my room again during my stay, and the receptionist put a note on my room to ensure the cleaners didn't come in. However, the next day the cleaners continued to ignore the 'Do Not Disturb' sign, came into my room without my permission, and took all the presents I'd bought for my family and put them in a bin bag. WHY??? See this is why I don't like cleaning staff coming into my room; they never just clean, they always do something really weird that makes me feel extremely uncomfortable. Not to mention the whole invasion of privacy issue. But if you don't mind people coming into your room without permission and going through your personal belongings, picking them up and putting them in bags, then would recommend this hotel.",1,0.5806513409961686

I attend numinous conferences across the country and this is the first time I have ever been denied a complemtary late checkout so I could attend a function included in the conference schedule. Due to the attendance this conference brought to this venue (use to be hosted in Burbank) I would have thought the hotel would have been more accommodating for such a minor request. It would have allowed over 2 hours to prepare the room for incoming occupants. Which is more than adequate for a venue of this type.

290205157,"This is a farm resort. Here is a lot of typical Tuscanian trees and a several cottages and other buildings with apartments. Two brothers: Filippo and Luca, the owners of this resort they are very friendly and helpful, thank guys! Whole resort is very tidy, the grass is trimmed, swimming pool is clean, sunbeds at the pool are in good condition, part of them pretty new. Each cottage and each apartment has dedicated garden furniture (a table with chairs). Entire resort is surrounded by fence.My cottage was quite good equipped. There is a bedroom and living room with kitchen corner. In the bedroom is one wardrobe and queen size bed and TV. In the living room you'll find one bed for 2 people, a table with chairs. Both rooms have air conditioning (extra payable). At the kitchen corner is induction cooktop, a kettle, a big refrigerator, some pots, the cutlery, the plates and the glasses.At the day of your arrival you can expect welcome drink in the bar as well you will be given a bottle of wine and some products for your first breakfast.What to improve: 1. better Wi-Fi is really needed, should be available in the cottages (not only at some places).  2. the white grit at the parking place should be removed (my car was awfully dirty inside and outside after 11 days staying on this grit)  3. in the restaurant each day might be offered dinners instead of only few dinner-events (quite expensive). 4. guest who takes something from the bar should sign the receipt to avoid mistakes at the moment of payment.Generally I recommend La Fattoria di Tirrenia. This is a safe place, very convenient for family with kids. It is well prepared and well maintained farm resort. It is placed approx. 2 km from the beach with white sand. Unfortunately the route to the sea and to city goes through a field and forest (no lights at night). The nearest cities: Tirrenia and Calambrone are not interesting and are polluted, but from here is only 20 minutes to Pisa, and not far away to Florence.",1,0.5269054178145088
456007501,"Our family of 5 stayed at the Hilton in January 2017 for nearly 2 weeks.  We booked a junior suite with kitchen and an adjoining room and this worked well.  The rooms were generously sized and clean.   We were greeting by front desk and they allowed us to check in to one of our rooms 4hrs early which was appreciated after a 24hr trip.   It was also a pleasure to have our ski lift tickets and other booking information given to us on arrival at the hotel, saving us lining up at ski school etc.    On arrival to our rooms there were gowns and slippers for 4 people, however they knew the booking was for 5.  These little discrepancies continued through the trip, for example coffee is provided and you get to use either ceramic or take away cups,  however there were never 5 take away cups available.

I believe it should be standard if a gown is removed then a new one is delivered to replace it, this doesn't occur though as housekeeping doesn't stock the gowns, front desk arranges them.The Good:-  The room was generous in size and the hallways were quiet.  The lifts were fast getting you up and down to the lobby and the staff were helpful.  Kitchen had a dishwasher which saved on Housework!  With a family of 5 (including 3 teens) the free wifi was a bonus, it was fast too (better than at home!)The Best:- Close to the lifts, free storage of ski gear at Summit Hire (beside Hilton)The Bad:- the fireplace in our larger room was purely for show with a 2hr burning log given to us each day that smelt strongly of kerosene long after the fire had burnt out.  We decided the odour from the fireplace wasn't worth it, it didn't provide heat in the room that we noticed. The Worst:- The kitchen.  We paid for this luxury to save some money by cooking or our family, however the hotplates were lacking, they look a long time to get hot and the outer rings on the larger hotplates never heated up.  (to be fair we didnt report this until our last day and we made do)  We found the kitchen to be lacking in some tools needed to cook, mostly lack of frypans (there was only one small one), we did mention this to the front desk and they got us a brand new pan within hours which was appreciated.On check out it was suggested that we could use the spa shower/bathroom after a day of skiing, allowing us time to dress and shower before our flights.   Although this is appreciated, there is only one shower in the spa for women and many people checking out.  We waited an hour at the end of the day to use this facility.  Not sure if it can be improved, it was nice to have the option to use the spa even with a delay in accessing it.The main thing we would of liked was a higher floor in the hotel with a view to the mountain, the location of the hotel limits this slightly.  We did book a year in advance and put in a request for a room with a view, on arrival it was disappointing that our &quot;view&quot; was of the driveway/entrance to the hotel. In the big scheme of things this didn't matter but it definitely would of been appreciated if a bit more effort went into the request, especially considering the time frame in the lead up to our booking.   As it was, we had a view to the outside and could see if snow was falling, and a view to the back of whistler which was quite pretty.  Photo of the view uploaded.The only other thing to note was the spa/hot tub.  There were two hot tubs, one outside and one inside a pool and other facilities.   These were quite busy each afternoon.  There was never anyone supervising these areas which leads to children using the hot tubs often without parent supervision.   Signage clearly stated that children under 14 are not to use the tubs without a supervisor, however there was never anyone putting this rule into practice.   Lastly.. the conferences that were occurring in the hotel impact other guests.    Guests at conferences, seem to congregate around the lifts, lounge, fireplace areas especially in the mornings and at about 4-5pm.    During the conferences, I would suggest you simply avoid the hot tub spa area's as they are overcrowded and its not worth the struggle to find a spot.So a positive experience for our trip, with staff who were friendly.   The baggage service should be mentioned for a polite and swift service too! (Good job!).   You pay for the location to the mountain, so if you can afford it then why not.   We would stay here again in a heartbeat as the small negative concerns were quite insignificant during a two week period.   The location to the village and the lifts are perfect and worth the extra $$.</span><span class=""taLnk ulBlueLinks moreBtn"" onclick=""widgetEvCall('handlers.clickExpand', event, this);"">More</span>",1,0.4636124443189661

The person who picked up the phone had advised me that the on duty manager, Melanie will be getting into contact with me. I get a knock on my door and I see the house lady holding a bottle of multi-purpose cleaner..? I asked her what she was here for and she told me front desk had sent her to &quot;clean&quot; my couch. I called the  front desk and to request a room change. The front desk asked me to wait for the manager' s call. I waited about 20 mins. At this point all I want to do is get a new room and rest especially after the long drive here. Finally, Melanie calls and tells me she will be coming to &quot;inspect&quot; our hotel. During the whole &quot;inspection&quot; she kept making remarks as if I made this whole ordeal up. Are you kidding? Of course she is unable to find any bugs or &quot;signs&quot; and she told me there was NOTHING she could do. I asked to be switched to another room and she basically implied she is not willing to do anything else but can get house cleaning to &quot;clean the room again&quot;.

Its absolutely amazing how this hotel has been transformed into such a gorgeous and luxurious hotel. As we pulled up to the hotel, we were warmly greeted by the bellmen, Bolton and Will. These gentlemen took great care of us and our belongings. What a great feeling to be welcomed so warmly the minute one arrives at a hotel! The rooms have the most comfortable mattresses, finest linens and all the amenities you could ever want, including robes. They bathroom is quite exquisite, with its grand two door entrance, marble countertops, double sink, and oversized shower.If so inclined, you can choose to indulge in an on sight spa service at the NOPSI Spa. There is an on sight restaurant, multiple bars, one in the grand atrium and one in the restaurant area. Be sure to check out Above the Grid, the rooftop pool and bar. Above the Grid is open to hotel guests and locals, providing everyone with an extraordinary view of the citys skyline. NOPSI Hotel is about a 1 mile from Bourbon Street.

The problem came about 3 months later when we received an alert from our credit card that someone was attempting to bill another night there without our card being present.  Turns out that Courtyard said we stayed 3 nights and had also billed us for an additional day of parking ($18).  I called and talked to the finance person, who insisted that I needed to prove we had only stayed 2 nights.  So I located our reservation info and sent it to her, along with the parking receipt for 2 days.  We did get reimbursed for the extra day room charge and parking, but it makes me a little uneasy that instead of trying to contact us they just decided after all that time to just put the charge on our credit card.

After calling taxi companies who didn't answer we walked up to the main road &amp; found a taxi, thank goodness.This is a great little hotel which has all the comforts needed &amp; extremely close to all the sights of Pisa- highly recommended.",1,0.5548888888888889

The map in reception is still upside down however :-) We tried breakfast at 7 euros each and were quite satisfied with this. It seems more like a hotel geared up for business clients rather than holiday makers but it suited us just fine as holiday makers. a 20 minute walk to the field of miracles and a good base for visiting Sangimgnano and La Foce.  Free Underground parking is a bonus and if that is full there is a car park round the back, A good proper double bed and a nice clean comfy room. I would recommend",1,0.5762345679012344

The host greeted us at the door and showed us everything and gave us information and a map to help us find our way to the Tower and other sights.

173062202,"I booked this hotel as a little weekend getaway for my girlfriend and I and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. I booked our stay through their website and for $40 upgraded to a mansion suite on the day we checked in. That was the best decision ever. The suite was very spacious, the king size bed was super comfortable, and the entire room was spotless. While the pool was smaller than what it appears in photos, the water was perfect. We definitely lounged around the pool for a couple of hours. The bath tub in the room was also a very nice touch, though it would be nice if they included a little bottle of bubble bath (we made our own by using a lot of shampoo).The only gripe was the food service in general. Though technically room service was offered, we didn't have a room service menu. My girlfriend went down to the restaurant to order food and asked them to bring it up to the room, for which they charged an extra $15 or so. I've stayed at hotels before, so I knew there would be a charge for the service, but when we basically had to do half the work, we might as well have done it all and saved that money. Either way, the food (a chicken club, steak fries and a flatbread pizza) were delicious.Our biggest food service complaint, though, was the breakfast buffet. Though the selection was decent and the food good, no waiter came up to us to offer water, orange juice or coffee until we stopped one of them a good 10 or 15 minutes into the meal.All that said, our total experience was very good and we'll definitely consider Hayes Mansion whenever we plan another getaway.",1,0.5926388888888887

The rooms were very clean, well maintained &amp; comfortable. Expected the rooms to be small (if not tiny) -- but that was not really the case. The room was decent - a double bed, a desk &amp; a closet. Bathroom was clean &amp; elegant. Bed was very comfortable &amp; we were able to sleep very well.The staff are absolutely very helpful -- help you with a map of Pisa and mark all the directions need for you, bus connections to airport etc. We reached an hour ahead of check-in time -- the housekeeping were still at work. But immeditaly they readied a room for us in 5mins and let us have it. Even the housekeeping staff were very friendly &amp; cheerful. The hotel has a nice little lounge with a few sofas, a TV, a internet connection that guests can use. The lounge is painted in lively colours &amp; graffiti -- gives the place a very energetic &amp; youthful appeal. There are vending machines in the lounge for coffee, water etc -- which are very inexpensive. You get a coffee or water for 50cents -- if you need a quick fix. The hotel is just a minute walk from the leaning tower. Lot of places to eat all the way from the hotel to the tower.  Just opposite the tower there is a very small place selling icecream -- the icecream is delicious (better than the Gelato we had in Rome). No elevator in the hotel. But we were able to leave our child buggy at the reception - and grab it whenever we stepped out. Our little one liked the lounge a lot with all the paintings on the walls. They dont serve breakfast, but have an agreement with a  nearby bar for breakfast at 3euros. We did not try that. Overall -- it is a great place to stay for the location, sleep quality, cleanliness &amp; helpful staff. Considering the price -- the value is just unbeatable.  For 2-3nights stay it is best to stay here &amp; splurge on food in a place of your choice.",1,0.552543859649123

The resort staff advised me that i could &quot;try my luck with the handicapped spot&quot; i opted not to take his advice and parked in the closest spot available. Which was not remotely close to my room. What did i pay for? When i entered mo room the first thing i noticed was that it looked nothing like the room i was lead to believe i reserved based on their VERY misleading website. The room i recieved was tiny, dirty, smelly, and very uncomfortable. The television in the room was a step down from ones you may find on the side of the road. Dealing with the staff was an absolute NIGHTMARE! At one point during my stay i needed some towels. I after multiple hours and many phone calls where staff promised me the towels were on their way, I walked down to the pool and got the towels myself. Through out the remainder of my stay i wondered if my towels might show up but they never did. The people in the room next door ordered room service and left their dirty dishes out on the balcony. They are most likely still sitting there collecting bugs.

We have noticed that the staff as well as our contact person, Ms. Erin O'Connor-Miller, has taken the time to learn the needs of our group and always improves and anticipates our needs.  They always make sure that the items we need are convenient and available for our use.  They treat all of our participants very well and we have never had any complaints from our supervisors about the accomidations or the service received from the hotel staff.  The hotel grounds are beautiful and a tremendous site for business conferences.  The grounds have been in top condition during every one of our stays.  I think the best part has to be the size of their property.  It is big enough that you would never have to leave.  There are several pools and several restraunts.  If you do have to leave the property, the San Diego Metro Trolley System (SDMTS) has a stop directly behind the hotel.  It is so convenient to get anywhere in the city.

621638323,WORST HOSTEL I'VE EVER STAYED IN!  Iâve stayed in 100's of hotels all over Europe and this one was the most absurb experience I've ever had. They chased after me everytime I entered the building to &quot;Prove&quot; I was actually staying there. My friend even got harassed and literally escorted out of the building when I had to come back to pick something up from my bag. They wouldn't even let me bring a guest to my &quot;hotel room&quot; for 5 minutes. It is was so embarassing being chased like a common criminal in a place I was paying to stay at!! The next morning the crazy owner lady called my room 5 times before 8am and tried to charge me for an &quot;extra person&quot; because my friend (who was escorted from the building before even walking up the stairs) was &quot;staying there&quot; and we were &quot;breaking the law&quot;. She even threatened to call the cops!! It was beyond unreal.Needless to say I left a early (without even a refund) just avoid whatever crazy things they made up next.

Although we were not a part of the organizing committee, from an attendees viewpoint, it seemed like a perfect venue for the event, with everything that was needed for a successful conference.  The banquet and seminar halls were spacious and av was more than adequate.  The Friday night conference reception and Saturday night banquet were catered by the hotel and the food at both was excellent.  There is an onsite restaurantl and our buffet breakfasts were included with the price of our room.

On arrival we were told there are in fact no connecting rooms with the suites. To be fair, we were given 2 normal  rooms at a slightly reduced price, but I would not have booked had I known this.- too little staff in general. a 30 minute wait to check in, 20 minute to check out, no luggage porters, ...- breakfast buffet is included but everything is served on a single table and generally mayhem as a result - pool bar is managed by a separate company and VERY expensive. EUR73 for 4 pizzas and a few cokes....? Really?- the rooms and hotel are quite modern in their decoration but even though the hotel is not that old, it was a bit run down already with water stains on the ceiling in the bathroom, etc- the 3rd night there was a large reception in the pool bar, just below our rooms with music playing loudly into the late hours. We were not informed of this when we booked or even when we were there. Not good.- WAY too few sun loungers around the pool.  I counted 26 for a hotel with 100+ rooms.  Every few minutes guests would show up and not find a lounger, then being forced to sit on the ground    or in the bar.- the site is surrounded by 3 roads so when you sit by the pool you see cars driving by and are overlooked by neighbours.

Online booking was quick and provided good explanation of packages and room types, another bonus was payment wasn't taken until arrival to the aparthotel. I was spectical about the Roomzzz at first due to the great price on one of the most expensive nights to stay in Manchester (Â£149) whereas other places with arguably the same spec and standard were double the price.Check in- efficient, really quick and friendly staff. Reception area has a modern feel, nice environment. Also responded well to my online request at the time on booking for a room high up with a view, this proved to be no problem, even with how busy they were.Room- I had booked a smart studio room for one night. Immediate thoughts were fantastic, the room definitely had the 'wow' factor and looked modern and luxurious. The bathroom was finished to a high spec with twin sink basins (always a nice bonus) and a walk in shower with twin 'waterfall' shower heads. Small practical additions such as heated mirrors and flooring in the bathroom really made the difference. The room had air-con which seemed to work great, a TV which could rotate from work desk to the end of the bed- great for long weekend stays. A superb and modern kitchenette which had everything you needed to make a decent meal. Lighting in the room was very well thought of and highlighted the stunning old features in the room such as original wood beams- a great mix of both modern and old, a desirable feature for most up-to-date hotels. The bed was plenty big enough and comfortable overall, I gained a good nights sleep.WiFi was also really easy to access and speedy- an extra plus thi was included in the room price. The tv had a USB port to connect your phone- handy for streaming nextflix, nowTV etc from your devices Check- out/ Breakfast- Grab&amp;Go breakfast worked great for us and all we needed. Check-out was again, fast, friendly and efficient,- Slight negativesi Mac computer was not in the room as advertised. The receptionist was apologetic and said this was due to servicing. However, this would have just been an added bonus to the room- I don't think we would have used for just one nights stayLinen and bedding felt cheap- pillows and duvet felt a little less luxurious to the rest of the room and linen was scratchy but this was forgiven for the one night. Also, the sheets only just fit the bed size and came off at corners by morning- this unfortunately revealed some interesting (but inevitable) mattress stains. With only a thin protection sheet below the bottom sheet, this did make me feel a little uncomfortable.Overview- an overall great stay, my partner and I loved the room and location (being right next to china town and a few bars), we will definitely be using this hotel company again.",1,0.5158815958815959

Because I feel like the hotel is better than average, but not &quot;very good.&quot;That said, the location is great, right off the highway so good for travelers.  It's also near a lot of dining options, a short drive to the next exit West. When we were there the ramp to return from that exit was closed, so we had to go through town but we consulted a map before we left so it was easy to find our way back.The hotel entrance is a little worse for wear, and we had to walk through a plume of smoke from people sitting right outside the entrance smoking. When you get inside, the lobby is very nice and the attached restaurant is good-looking too.Even though this is a &quot;all non-smoking&quot; hotel, our first room reeked of smoke. It doesn't matter how much you clean a room, it has to be overhauled if you want that smell out. But the staff was super-nice about putting us on the second floor in a previously non-smoking room. I'm not sure why they don't just fill up those floors first? Or leave the ground floor unit for people with pets since they can walk out the sliding door right out onto the parking lot. It was not a nice room.At any rate, our second room was quite nice. Sliders looking out into the courtyard and a decent amount of space. But the hallways are not impressive. Old rusty keycard units on every door, old acoustic ceiling tiles...just old and worn looking all together.  Bathrooms are clean but super-tiny with value amenities and our television remote wouldn't change the channel, even after we got new batteries form the front desk. So we watched the weather channel the whole time.We got 2 vouchers for breakfast for our family of four with a whole bunch of &quot;rules&quot; about what we could and couldn't get. Had to upgrade for $5 more to get eggs or anything hot. My husband did this and the kids and I just had cereal, yogurt and fruit. Both were good. The pool looks like it's in a parking garage, cement ceilings, bare-bones finishing. Pool was a good temperature and they have a hot tub. I did not use the sauna.So this is my issue, it really isn't a bad hotel. It's quite clean, the staff is friendly and helpful, and some areas like the lobby and the second room we got, were very nice.  I'm wondering if it's slowing being renovated? There was just a disconnect between how nice some areas were and how old and rough looking others were.We booked though another agency with a 3-5 star rating and I would not say this is on par with their other 3-star hotels. I'd put it at a 2.5. A moderate/value hotel. So if that's what you're looking for, then this is a good choice.",1,0.4916165551620096

Ski lockers in the basement and underground parking($20/day) are nice features.  Free Wifi!The unit is a 2000 sq ft, 3 bedroom, 3.5 bath unit with full kitchen, dining table that seats 8, small balcony, small TV and two couches.  There is a spiral staircase for access to the loft.  there is a closet in enrtyway and laundry room to store ski boots.  The king bedroom on main floor has, TV, wall closet, two dressers and smaller bathroom with shower and single vanity.  Up in loft, there is a king bedroom with walk in closet, larger bathroom with a tub/shower combo and large vanity.  It has a TV, however bedroom is open to main floor below.  To reach this bedroom, you have to walk through the queen bedroom, also in the loft.  The queen bedroom has a small wall closet, small bathroom with shower and no TV.  It is a condo, so housekeeping comes once during the week.  Most everything you would need to make a meal is in the condo.  Staff are attentive if ever there is an issue.

30879549,"We stayed five nights at Micheleâs Bed and Breakfast and had a truly wonderful break helped enormously by Michele and Giada who were both exceptional hosts. Our room Cinque Terre was spotlessly clean and wonderfully well appointed with laptop, fridge and a mind boggling selection of wines and liquors. The bathroom was a good size and again very clean with lots of toiletries.But what places Micheleâs head and shoulders above the standard bed and breakfast was the friendliness and attention to detail. Michele provides great advice and is brilliant at providing an itinerary especially tailored to each individual guest.The breakfasts were plentiful and served by the super efficient Giada who also made fresh desserts daily which were truly sublime.The location is spot on to explore this beautiful part of Italy located very near the train station and airport.To top it off Michelle gave us a lift to the airport a perfect example of how this wonderful host goes the extra mile (pardon the pun) for his guests.Look no further for accommodation which is exceptional value for money.",1,0.6727777777777777

The room was musty, the AC was really loud so it had to be turned off at night, which in turn made the room way too hot, and the room was really small. The pillows were uncomfortable and the beg had a sag in the middle of it, it was like you sunk down a few inches. The toilet seat needs fixed, and the bathroom floor looked like it could use a mop as it hadn't seen one in a while.The front desk is friendly, but the rooms are not traveler friendly.The breakfast room is really small and was nothing more than cereal, fruit, and a waffle machine.

84608709,"Abitalia Tower Plaza, Pisa, ItalyWhen your epic trip covers everything from camping at seven day dance festivals and no star hotels in far-flung places, you're entitled to occasional five star luxury. So it was that when we finally made it through Portugal, Spain, France to Italy, we decided to indulge by staying at Abitalia Tower Plaza, having found a good deal online.ATP is an impressive complex. New, sprawling and with all the mod cons you'd expect from a five star hotel, including two swimming pools, a wellness and fitness centre, bar with complimentary canapes, restaurant and pricey luxury items for sale. There's even a a slightly distant veiw of the Leaning Tower from the ground floor and, I assume, some of the rooms.Our room was well appointed; large, firm bed, comfortable furniture and generally designer decorated. There was a large TV but the only English channels were CNN and dull business news reports (yawn) and no English subtitles on any of the fun stuff. Oddly, there was a mini bar but no booze â I guess to encourage you to utilise the bar downstairs. Wifi is free and available in the rooms.Oh and noise. As comfortable as the room was, the walls are thin and chairs dragged across the wooden veneer floors in the next room, as well as talk and some television sound â were audible. It was not overly loud, just not expected.The restaurant was good enough for us to eat there both nights of our stay... although it must be said that this was in part due to the distance the hotel is from the major sites and Pisa town centre. The cab ride to and from the train station is between 11 and 16 Euro. And as avid walkers as we are (Our policy - best way to get to know a city? Get lost in it on foot) this was not a hotel that was easy to walk to or from. The walk to the Piaza del Duomo and the Tower took about 20 or so minutes but was extremely pedestrian-unfriendly in parts. Likewise the walk home from the city took about 40 minutes but in parts there was simply no footpath so that you had to walk in stretches on the edge of the road, and if you know Italian driving you'll understand why this is not recommended.And surprisingly for a five star hotel in this position, there was no shuttle service. We asked about a shuttle back into the station when leaving and the receptionist said no problem, they will book it. What they booked was a cab, thus the 16 Euro trip to the station.The service at front desk was a little perfunctory. They did the job but looked like they would rather be doing something else. Restaurant staff, on the other hand, were excellent; courteous, professional but ready with a joke if the opportunity presented itself. And if the tagliatelle with rabbit sauce is on the menu, do try.Overall, if you want to splurge and you have a car, give Abitalia a go. It's one of two five star hotels in Pisa. But I think next time I'll settle for a star or two less, closer to town.",0,0.4753843095679831

We took advantage of the ample kitchen and spent a lot of time out on the very large deck, which looked down onto the ski lifts and stroll.  The location is a bit noisy at night.  Our room was in the close proximity to several pubs, but as we're city dwellers, this wasn't a big deal for us.The iron in the room stopped working while I was using it, and I called the front desk, and they were very quick to bring a replacement.

I was extremely fortunate to find a space on the street almost directly across from the hotel but if I hadn't, it would have been a long walk.  The clerk at the front desk when I checked in was a nice guy and provided good service but that doesn't make up for the accommodations.  Room was extremely small, which is not a big deal but it was very dated and needing attention.  The room I had was below a staircase and so the area had some majorly bright lights.  The blinds in my room were broken in a couple of spots so the light shined through almost feeling like I had headlights in my window all night.  Very noisy as well.  No iron and ironing board.  Then came the shower, smaller than a phone booth!!!!

In fact, our find was that one should hit a local coffee shop.  Besides the lines being shorter, folks are remarkably friendly and open, the coffee is excellent and the pastries are local and better.  Hit the same place three days in a row and you'll be shooting the breeze like you've lived there a year.  So while the anti-corporate mentality may be a bit militant, it makes for a pleasant main street to wander up and down.  Now to the hotel.  The room smelled musty and the carpet had that mildly-wet feeling from high-humidity climates.  Our bathroom sink faucet swiveled left-and-right, though not by design.  The toilet was constantly on the verge of stopping up (did the previous tenants through a baggie of dope down it?).  There was a table on the patio, but the patio had some kind of half-worn off macadam covering that made it uneven (repairmen were working their way down patios sanding that stuff down, which was very noisy during the day).  The room had two chairs on opposite sides; we used the bed for sitting and as a table.There was a fridge and microwave.The wall had been torn and repaired (badly).  There was a new door to the bathroom, and while that was fine, the frame around it was unpainted.  An attempt has been made to spruce up the courtyard -- box planters on the 2nd and 3rd floor railings, container plants below, strings of lighting overhead, and so on.  Some of the lights were burnt out, and the fountain in the middle was bone dry.  Indicative of good intentions that are not well-funded.A good cable TV selection and free wireless internet were bonuses.As others have noted, the rooms are very noisy.  From newlyweds on one side (they'll learn, I guess) to a guitarist practicing his heavy metal riffs (presumably for a local show one evening), to drunken screeching in the courtyard, to the sound of Harleys being revved, to one fight on Newport Ave outside our room, to revelers at all hours (including nine a.m. one morning), to a pretty good ad hoc music jam session (think three of the talented players were sailors) at the POW/MIA memorial, to fire trucks, to a thumping bass from a nearby bar, to the occupants above us daring walk to the bathroom, to people yelling at their buddies across the street -- the joint is NOISY.  We've lived in 24/7 congested areas of several large cities abroad and in the US and never had noise like this.  So, if you want a quiet weekend by the beach, this ain't the place, by a long shot.We enjoyed the town and its free-wheeling environment, but hated the hotel -- save the staff.We figure for the annoying noise level and the run-down condition of the hotel, it's worth about half the price we paid per night.

We spent our twentieth wedding anniversary over Memorial Day weekend in a junior suite with views of the Terrasse Dufferin and the St. Lawrence. What a magical flavor of France at half the cost. I must concur with other reviews with regard to the Champlain Restaurant - overpriced and lacking in the quality one would expect at an establishment of this caliber. Uninspired by the one meal taken in-house, the balance were taken at local eateries... the selection of which to choose from was extensive. If your objective is to remain in-house throughout your stay, perhaps the Frontenac is not the place for you... Le Meridien Versaille is not too far away, but you'll definitely be sacrificing on location.

610661140,"I stayed here two years ago in the Springtime, and it was wonderful, so I braved it in the middle of Summer.  The location is still excellent - walking distance from everything in Pisa, right on the Arno (though there is a lot of road construction happening on either side of them, so getting in and out is a bit more difficult).  They've opened a bunch of new restaurants along the streets behind it that are definitely worth checking out.  The staff continue to be excellent - they want to help and try hard to do so, whatever you bring them.  The building is still the same elegant palazzo space.  Of course, it's that elegant palazzo building that makes the place more challenging in Summer, because it doesn't lend itself to a central-air retrofit.  Air conditioners are window units that can get pretty quickly overwhelmed if it's hot and humid (and it was while I was there!), and the large, high-ceilinged rooms rather exacerbate the problem.  The AC unit gave out entirely in the first room we had, and the one in the second room, while more robust, still had episodes of flashing lights and reset buttons in the middle of the night.  Fortunately we were up high enough that we could throw the windows open, which results in excellent airflow when the room door is open, so we could cool the room off at night before bed, which helped with the AC (we didn't leave the windows open at night because of the revelry in Piazza Garibaldi), and it was cool and comfortable in the morning.  I may think twice about rooms there in the dead of Summer (or conversely I'd seek something in the back of the building so I could throw open the windows and keep the air moving!), though I'll certainly consider it in all the other seasons - the location is great and the price is really good.",1,0.5769109461966605

Hence, comfortable accommodations will be mandatory. If it`s for a combination of reasonable price &amp; acceptable facilities, this hotel will do. From here, walking in one direction for less than thirty minutes and passing through Ponte Solferino,  will bring oneself to Piazza Vittorio Emanuel and the train station. Near this area will be the bus station. The hotel, situated in a quiet neighborhood with other hotels, restaurants and shops nearby, is not new.

We saved $20 in taxis.- There is a daily free shutttle service to Seaworld/San Diego Zoo and other places around San Diego.  Pick up is at 9am to 4:30pm.  It was a bit rushed since we wanted to explore Seaworld more, but overall the free ride was worth it (otherwise would have costed about $15-$20 in taxis)- Very close to the Fashion Valley mall - the hotel is about a 10 minute walk.  My bf and I walked there twice to grab dinner at the Cheesecake cafe and then go shopping.  Great stores and fairly upscale - Nieman Marcus, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, JCPenney, Macy's, Abercrombie etc.  (stuff us Canadians do not have in our malls)- The room was clean, towels were clean and the room had all the amenities we needed (fridge, hairdryer - however, they do not provide an iron) - we got a pool view and it was fairly quiet.  Do not get a room by the highway.  - Buy bottled water in the little souvenir shop in the main floor.  This is better priced that buying water outside.- Pool is very clean. The towels were replaced daily and the surrounding is kept organized.  - Location is good. The surrounding area is very safe for first time travellers to San Diego.  Options for getting around also include taking the bus (which is $5 for all day pass).  The bus stop is right in front of the hotel.- Take advantage of the discounted SeaWorld/Zoo tickets at the hotel- Complementary Safe - it was good that the access was through front reception.Cons:- The breakfast was overpriced.  There isn't anywhere else to grab breakfast aruond the hotel so we had to eat at the Postcards for $14 each per dish and it was good, however too expensive.  They usually had the buffet breakfast but on the day we were there, for some reason, they did not offer it.  A bowl of cereal was like $6 or something!- We booked a King room in advance.  When we got there, they could not find a King room which was one of our specific requests.  Instead they offered two double beds which was fine but still we had to adjust to it.- Lots of activity around the main floor.While we were there, there was a prom and wedding and numerous conventions everyday.   It was bit noisy since we can hear the bass coming from the party rooms from inside our hotel room.  -  On the first day, there was a faint old smell coming from inside the room (probably the carpet or the bed).

We saw the Andrew Jackson during a ghost tour we took one evening (it is apparently haunted) so I looked it it up on Hotels.com and got a room for our last two nights.I think it's very important to point out that the room we got was through Hotels.com. We got a great deal, but this is a room that they would normally have trouble booking at their regular rate. Our room was very small, it was a double bed with one night stand, a tv on a small dresser, an area to hang clothes and a (decently sized) bathroom. I think we had the smallest room in the hotel, in the mornings we could see into other rooms as the staff was cleaning them and many of them were much larger and nicer then ours.That said, you don't come to NOLA to sit in your room. Our room was well priced and served our needs. The staff was friendly and offered a valet service for our car. It's not a five star hotel, but is great for people on a budget.",1,0.4475142450142451

We called the night staff who tried as well with no success so they allowed us to use another room (downstairs) so we carted our stuff down and back up in the middle of the night. The next day, we could not use the jacuzzi (one of the main reasons for booking the room). I had mentioned to the lady that it was broke and they told us we had to turn the cold water 360 degrees (which we did and so did the night staff). I expressed my opinion that 1. if you have to do something different to turn on the water, there should be a note stating that and 2. Being able to use another jacuzzi once is not acceptable for price we paid and on our honeymoon. There was no real apology or even a discount given. I at least feel we should have been charged the price of a room that didn't have a jacuzzi. Not impressed. We were so looking forward to being able to soak and relax at our leisure.

Aside from the location, there wasn't really anything that was above and beyond a normal hotel stay. Rooms were clean.However, several issues did come up. They didn't ruin my trip or anything (and I never made any formal complaints), but it did make me feel like I didn't get the best possible value:  * The complimentary guestroom WiFi was non-existent. This one bugged me the most.  * It took three phone calls to get someone to bring an extra blanket up to the room.  * I'm a Hilton Gold Member, and I had to request breakfast tickets when they should have been complimentary and provided to me at check-in.  * Breakfast service was extremely lacking. I think the crew was severely understaffed that particular morning. Getting shown our table was the extent of staff interaction. We had to look around for the kettle/pitchers of coffee and water and had to scrounge for our own additional table setting. Throughout the meal, several tables were left unbussed after the guests left.I spent my trip with close friends, so these issues hardly impacted this trip's enjoyment! However, I AM a Hilton Gold Member and previous stays at other Hiltons created an expectation of a certain level of attentiveness and service.

576375889,"Probably what I would expect from a 1 or 2 star hotel.Stayed for 1 night on 21 April and whilst not great, it was acceptable for an overnight stay.  Came back a week later and stay was awful. First stay was in a contemporary room (apparently an upgrade I was told on our second visit), second stay was in a classic room - read not updated for perhaps 30 years. Just awful. Peeling paint on the ceiling in bathroom, stained and faded carpet, damaged furniture and fixtures, stained chair, shower curtain not a screen, one bedside light not working, the other lights made an alarming noise when switched on and bathroom floor tiles looked dirty because the grout was black and the tiles chipped.We were horrified when we saw the classic room and asked to move. We were then given a key to a room with a double bed (as originally requested) and that was just as bad as the first and actually had a third bed which blocked the mini bar and took up most of the floor space. We were told there was no option for an upgrade since the rooms were all occupied. We had asked for a quiet room too - but we got probably one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel given the poor glazing and being on the first floor on a corner with loads of traffic and people just below the window. We were going to move to a different hotel but given it was nearly 8pm and we were travelling home the next day we decided to put up with the room. It was a most unpleasant last night after what was otherwise a lovely holiday.Pros - near to station. Not a reason to stay at the hotel. Easy to do Pisa as a day trip from Florence and that would be my recomendation. It's only 5 minutes on the Pisa mover from the airport to the central station and then less than an hour by train to Florence (â¬8.40 one way). Trains are frequent. Cons - Noisy - supposedly sound proofed. In the first room we heard the television from next door and anything that moved in the corridor - there are gaps under the doors. Second room - street noise, crying baby from room across the corridor, staff banging around in corridor, constant banging of doors.Horrible decor in the classic room - old, outdated, grubby. Ancient tiny TV. No tea and coffee facilities although these were provided when we asked.Grubby - both rooms had black mould in the bathroom. Unfriendly and not in the least welcoming. On arrival at the desk I said &quot;hello we are checking in for one night&quot;. I was greeted with no smile and the receptionist just  barked &quot;passports&quot; at me. No recognition we had stayed there just 6 days ago.No bar, no room service, no restaurant (other than for breakfast). Some kind of vending area with tired looking sandwiches was the only place to get refreshments in the hotel.Near to station also means not a nice area. Didn't feel particularly safe, especially given the lack of visible staff at the hotel. After around 5.30pm there was only one person on the frontdesk.Poor maintenance - kettle didn't work in first room because one of the pins from the plug had broken off and was lodged in the socket. One of the two bedside lights not working in second room. Handle missing from wardrobe door in second room.  Pillows were like sandbags - really uncomfortable.I cannot understand how this hotel has a four star rating. The classic rooms are in need of serious refurbishment, there are no real facilities in the hotel and the service is very poor. There is no concierge or anyone to help with bags. Breakfast was passable but nothing to get excited about.  All self service. This was the first time we had stayed at an NH hotel and it will certainly be our last.

Taxi from the airport was approx. 20 mins and cost 30 euros.On arrival the hotel was situated maybe 15 minutes walk from Tirrenia and maybe double that from Marina di Pisa ( a mistake not hiring a car). A bus stop about 25m to 50m outside takes you to Pisa for 2 euros (don't forget to buy your ticket and get it stamped on the bus). In a previous review it says that you can't get on to the beach out of season as the beaches are all private and cordoned off, we didn't find this to be the case and managed to go on the beach with no trouble at all by walking for about 5 mins towards Tirrenia and finding a footpath directly on to the beach. The hotel was very good in our opinion, very clean and the staff as mentioned in other reviews were absolutely fabulous, really friendly and helpful (really can't praise them enough). This is not a 5 star hotel by any means but then again neither are the prices. Would definitely recommend but would advise that you hire a car.

The staff were wonderful. Nice and helpful, and had a great sense of humor - encouraging our French. So nice. The concierge helped us with figuring out some good walks. Keep in mind that this is basically a hotel for rich people. Our room had a large wet bar, full of price-y snacks, but there were no soda or snack machines near the ice machines. One of the shops in the lobby has a small selection, as well as a small shelf with necessities, such as aspirin and so forth. You cannot use the fridge in the room for your own soda - or medications- they have a sign that says you would be charged! There is no microwave, nor is there a cafe or anyplace like that where you could use a microwave. I would recommend Epicerie Richard, just a couple of blocks away, for regular priced soda, snacks, necessities. The Funicular entrance also has a few things, including chocolate bars with maple crackles (delicious).Our double room had a rack for one suitcase, and no other countertop. We used the small desk for the second suitcase. There were two drawers in the nightstand between the beds, so we put a few things in there and lived out of our suitcases..there was a nice closet (with nice terry cloth robes) for clothes that we could hang. The bathroom was very nice, but with very little counterspace. Room to keep two toilet kits indeed the narrow top shelf, but this worked fine. The shower was nice and the bath products are just super - a slightly spicy scent, but not overpowering. There is no free WiFi. The restaurants are expensive, fancy dining - fabulous, if that's what you like. Plenty of choices in easy walking distance. Avoid Parmesan, though - WAY overpriced for what you get and not good. We parked at the Hotel de Ville lot - an uphill walk to the hotel, but less than ten minutes, and much less expensive. I think it was $18 CD weekdays, $12 on the weekend.

We called a 4 full days in advance of our booking date to cancel and was told by  management and customer service staff that they would NOT respect their cancellation policy and cancel our booking.  They did however offer a 90-day rain-check, a rain check subject to price increase on any date they deemed 'high demand'. Since we are from out of town, such a 90-day limit was unworkable. They left us with no choice but to either absorb the loss, sell our booking to others, or find a date within 90-days (and hopefully not be further up-charged at their discretion). The most annoying part is that, not once were we advised of such policy on our booking or confirmation either verbally or in documentation, and in an exhaustive search found that nowhere is such a policy mentioned any of their online information.

The hotel is well situated in Old Town with easy access to historic sites, restaurants and shopping (warning very touristy!) The staff was helpful and the hotel is a solid 4 star experience. The room decor is slightly dated for a Fairmont, but the hotel is well kept and the property worthy of its reputation. If Old Town shopping and arts were less touristy and more representative of Quebec's best; this hotel would be its natural epicenter.

398508659,"We picked a pricey time of year to come visit friends in Vancouver area. Decided to stay here because of the location and to try to upgrade to a nicer hotel since we were only there one night. Good location for sky train and metro town mall! Easy walk ways to take cheaper transportation. Parking overnight at the hotel was decent price. But the parkade is a gong show. Shared with the mall. No respect from other drivers (I know I know it's Vancouver) but seriously took us 10 minutes to get to P2 because drivers were all over the place. Check in went fine. The room quality is below what I would expect for a high price like this. We didn't pay for the Internet. Most hotels have it free now... Get with the times Hilton... Bathroom was the worst. No fan for ventilation, and the door won't stay open! We eventually propped it  open with a towel, but that meant the front door was blocked. The tiles look old and the grout is stained and dingy. Tried to make it fancy with a soaker tub but Meh. Didn't change much for me. Used room service for a few drinks. It was fast and good service. But just know a gratuity is included. They do inform you. We decided to pay cash. And handed her an amount and when we told her to keep the change, she offered to go grab us change from downstairs... Uhm what? I worked room service before. You don't carry change on you incase someone doesn't want to tip?! What the heck... Anyways. The maid walked into our room also in the evening saying she forgot to drop something off. Yes. She did knock. We asked who was there loudly! She must not have heard because she let herself in. Apologized. But still... Had a decent sleep. Didn't use the food services since we have our favourites from living in Vancouver prior. And checkout went just fine. Front desk staff was very friendly and courteous. But overall not what I would expect for such a pricey hotel... Wouldn't go back for sure. ",0,0.5424007936507935

This is an old hotel that is a little rough around the edges, but most &quot;historical&quot; hotels in the French Quarter have some issues with upkeep. If you are expecting the Ritz, go somewhere else. If you like great locations, unbeatable price, and friendly service, give it a try. The rooms are small but clean.

152755302,"The family and I parked ourselves at the Hotel Wilshire for two nights during a SoCal sojourn. As someone who has become increasingly attached to Kimpton properties, I was looking forward to the stay. For the most part, it did not disappoint.The hotel is in Mid-Wilshire, on a stretch of the famed street that's undergoing some transition. A bunch of businesses were shuttered, the area is still trying to define itself, but is hardly seedy or unsafe. A plus: McDonald's is just down the street, which was a plus staying with two young 'uns. Saved a lot on breakfast. LACMA and the La Brea tar pits are also just a short walk away, which we took advantage of.We stayed on a special rate that gave us a discount on the room and $13 daily for parking, down from $32. For a nominal fee, we were upgraded to a spacious, modern suite with a large dining table, a sleekly decorated bathroom and the nicest flatscreen TVs I've yet to encounter in a hotel. Having two channels each of HBO AND Showtime was a big plus during downtime.We didn't hear much noise. Our room was away from Wilshire Blvd., which helped. That meant a view of parking lots, but no worries. My wife did hear someone using a bathroom in an adjoining room, but all otherwise well.All of the front-desk staff we encountered in the thimble of a lobby were unfailingly helpful. One of the managers, without asking, offered our 7- and 5-year-olds toys that they happily accepted. In short, the Kimpton vibe was alive and well.Still, we encountered some lapses in attention to detail, which regrettably preclude a five-dot rating. They include:1) Despite knowing we were traveling with four people, there were no linens, pillows or blankets for the pull-out sofa. We spotted someone from housekeeping, who initially didn't want to believe there wasn't a blanket in the closet, as he obvously didn't want to make a second trip to fetch one.2) Speaking of housekeeping, when we returned to our room around 2:45 p.m. to regroup after the museums, the room had still not been made up even though we had been gone for five hours and the hotel did not appear to be close to being full. When I called the front desk, I was told someone would be there &quot;right away,&quot; which was defined as 40 minutes later.3) The New York Times was delivered to the door the first day, but not the second. I had to go down to the lobby to fetch one.4) Despite the promo rate being listed on my bill, it did not reflect the discounted parking rate. That had to be adjusted. No small deal. That was $41 in my favor.Individually, none of these things are big deals. But they add up and ultimately color your experience. Still, I'd go back, but I'd like to see the execution stepped up a notch to a level more in keeping with a typical Kimpton property. They're almost there. You should root for them to succeed.",1,0.3480790043290043

There is a &quot;Starbucks&quot; in the cafe, but they were using different coffee and flavors but keeping the Starbucks prices and names. The line for the cafe went out the door and around the pool, they would only help one guest at a time and wait for their coffee to be made. Our room was extremely small with an old tv, and smelled like it was 100 years old. They need some fresh air. The nicest part of the &quot;resort&quot; is the convention area, which has been mostly renovated. The rest is a 60s flashback. There are no hallways and the whole place is motel style. You have to pay for wifi and the gym. There is no complimentary breakfast. All of the restaurants served on dirty looking cups/plates and smelled gross. Our convention had paid for breakfast, which was 25$ per person per day. I am very happy I didn't pay for it, all we got is hard sausage and watery eggs. Although the property is in bad condition, the guest service is very good. We were satisfied with the maid service and the bellhop was very good with driving us around. Although the guest service and conference went well, you can't put lipstick on a pig. I would not stay here. It is not worth your money. Needs a renovation badly.",-1,0.5651642036124794

Right outside the hotel are shops, restaurants, bars etc. The rooms were luxurious and really large, but it was slightly dark; there was insufficient lighting. The bed sheets and towels were thick and very comfortable and there was an exorbitant amount of soap, shampoo and conditioner on offer in the hotel rooms. There is complimentary internet (wired and wireless); room was well-appointed but lacked some quality installations such as marble/granite etc. Skis and boots can be stored at the &quot;Summit&quot; shop located 30 seconds walk from the hotel lobby.

While the hotel had some old world charm to it and the rooms were good size, the negatives were tough to over come.  First off, they neglected to mention they were re-doing their facade, so locating the hotel was difficult. Once we finally found the place, getting to the &quot;private parking&quot; area was an adventure. It was located behind the hotel and it called for careful naviagation through a few alleys and then the hardest parallel parking job I've ever had to deal with.  Secondly, we made the mistake of requesting a room that overlooked the Arno. It was a mistake since the room also overlooked the busy street below. The street was busy 24/7 and made a sound nights sleep difficult. My request for a different room yielded nothing.Lastly, the room was lack luster.  As I said, it was large, but badly outdated. Beds were hard and the shower flooded the entire bathroom every time we used it.Besides that the terrace was nice, breakfast was solid, location was ideal as it was only a 5 minute walk to the tower and the staff was pleasant if not completely helpful.",1,0.5820197044334975

Our room had gold curtains, a gold painted ceiling, a chandelier, antique furniture (some of it a bit wobbly), a beautiful bay window and red and gold fabric wall coverings. The building is nearly 200 years old, so the chic is getting a little bit shabby, but the interior was a perfect compliment to the hotel's location right in the middle of the French Quarter. The manager was a bit hard to pin down, but we weren't looking very hard. It took two days to learn he actually lived in the hotel. If you want the usual front desk service, somebody to open doors for you or carry your suitcases, this is not the place for you, but we liked being left to our own devices. I would describe the ambience as something like an elegant boarding house. We spent an enjoyable evening on the balcony with two other couples and they too seemed to be enjoying their stay.

The check-in experience was excellent with a very helpful receptionist who went to great lengths to welcome us and provide us with useful information about the area. We then went to our room, on the 5th floor, which was - quite frankly - dismal. The drab, brown wallpaper was actually peeling from the walls, and there were metal shutters down on all the windows, preventing any natural light from entering the cave-like space. The air-conditioning units were ineffective, and I had one of the worst nights sleep of my life, in a really hot and stuffy bedroom. The upside was that the bathroom was bright and clean, with modern fittings....but a rather strong and unpleasant smell. We hoped that breakfast would lift our spirits, but it didn't. There was no welcome and everything was self service, poor quality and unpleasant. The orange juice tasted of chemicals and the roll I had was so stale that it crumbled apart when trying to butter it. One customer asked a member of staff if they could have an omelette, to which the answer was 'no', followed by howls of laughter behind the scenes. An elderly gentleman who was clearing tables was rude, grumpy and constantly muttering under his breath. On the huge flat-screen TV, there was a pop music channel playing, with pornographic videos and offensive lyrics...not really appropriate viewing at breakfast when travelling with 2 children. All in all, the experience was quite unpleasant, with the only saving graces being the man on reception and the very close proximity to the town and the airport.

The location is great right next to the tower and its complex and Mr Luca met us and checked us in at 1am which was good of him as i wouldn't expect most small BnBs to do this. They have parking at 10 euros per night (we were told initially we wouldn't be charged but we were on checkout which is fine and i didn't make an issue of it) but the entrance to the parking is small and i wouldn't recommend it if your car is bigger than a small saloon which ours was.However the whole experience was spoilt by a 10 euro unauthorised charge for a room key which we mistakingly took with us.

It's 10 minutes from Pisa airport and is adjacent to the train station and has a lot of bus routes right outside the door. The only thing I found wrong with it was the WiFi, which was very slow.The facilities in the area were not great though and we had to walk for a good 20 minutes to find somewhere to eat and then it was the slowest service I've ever seen.We then went to a pub/snack bar called Gambrinus and had 4 pints of beer each and when we got our bill it was over â¬65.00 which I found to be a total disgrace. They charged us â¬8.20 for each pint of beer so I can safely say I will never go back to that place if I go to Pisa again and I would urge other people to give it a miss.All in all, it was a great weekend but turned out to be a very expensive one but I will definitely return to Florence and Pisa in the future.",1,0.5007142857142858

401400847,We stayed at this camping for 1 night only. The camping house we stayed in was somewhat big for four persons and therefore it was more expensive than what we expected. 137 Euro is somewhat much for the simple camping standard. A hotel room for  2 adults and 2 kids will be just slightly higher. So contacting the camping directly instead of using booking.com etc. might pay off in order to get the suitable house.We chose this camping mainly because of the short distance to the Pisa Tower and because there is a fairly big swimming pool there. In the evening there was a performance by the swimming pool by a magician. Appreciated by the kids indeed.,0,0.3826984126984126

NO BATHROOM doors in either new or old part, only swinging short saloon type doors.  Very strange.  So if you buy, you get old part of hotel.  Then to get to new part we had to pay $150 for changing 7 days.  It was worth it.  The new part is not bad, and the hotel location is great.

From the pictures, description and reviews on other websites, we expected luxury accomodation.The hotel is centrally located and very near the tower of Pisa; however, it is in pretty poor maintenance condition, the rooms are tiny and full of dust --as if they had been empty for months. We found on our welcome night a used plaster on the bathroom floor which set our mood for the rest of our stay. If cleanliness is important for you, this hotel would not be a good choice. The roof terrace is not open to the guests --even though you will see some picture on the Internet of it with a table set for breakfast. For breakfast, don't expect freshly squeezed orange juice --rather from a machine, and be ready to drink your coffee from a glass if cups run out.This is more a 2 star hotel plus dirty and depressing.

I had a very tough night in a depressing room with almost no sleep at all.

The hotel is a couple of miles from decent restaurants and the night we were there a private holiday party took over the main restaurant, so unless we wanted to get back in the car after 7 hours of driving to find a nice restaurant, we were forced to eat in their little bar, which would have been lovely, except that many of the private party goers decided to drink before their reception and my wife and I were cramped into a small corner of the bar.

It is reasonably conveniently located - 30 minute walk to station, 30 minutes to the Tower, 40 minutes to the airport - or there is a bus which stops outside the hotel, LAM Blue to the station and change to LAM red to either the Tower or airport.  Tickets are pre-purchased from station, airport or some shops (we got ours from Coop supermarket service desk, 500yds up road next to hotel - 4E for 4 tickets). Alternatively buy from the driver although we found the drivers aren't interested in taking money, they just want to zoom off to the next stop!  You need to validate the ticket on the bus and the ticket lasts for 1 hour even if you change buses.  Taxi from airport takes 10mins and costs 10E.The room was standard but we had clean linen and towels daily.  The bed however was mega hard which was compounded by very un-plump pillows.  The water was hot at all hours and the bathroom had a good shower.  There was no room safe or tea making facilities (we took our own kettle).  They supplied 2 bottles of still and 2 bottles of sparkling water daily in the fridge (which wasn't cold and there was no way to change the temperature - adequate for water but not for milk or food).There was a large TV in the room (but programmes obviously in Italian).  My usual gripe about hotel room lighting: the lighting in bathroom and bedroom was too dim to do make-up by.  Staff were all cheerful and helpful and spoke English.  Free wifi but dropped out continuously, luckily we had our mifi with us.The breakfast buffet had a good choice of cereals, pastries, yoghurt, meats and cheese.  A limited cooked breakfast was also available.  The restaurant had a very limited menu consisting mainly of cheese and pasta.  However there is an excellent pizzeria 100yds to the left of the hotel on the opposite side of the road.If arriving at the hotel by the LAM Blue bus, the stop is immediately in front of the hotel on the opposite side of the road.  Get off the bus when you reach the end of the old buildings and there is a new red brick complex with &quot;Media World&quot; on the right hand side.This hotel was a good choice for us but I have marked the scoring down due to the hard bed (personal choice), lack of safe and the fact there was nowhere to sit/relax other than our room.",1,0.3713389388389388

I arrived at the stadium just in time for the game so I didn't have a chance to make a reservation until after the game was over.  So despite the fact that my online reservation came through very late in evening, in fact it was well past the time this small, family run hotel has indicated to online brokers that they are suppose to allow bookings, I was buzzed in after hours and they were mostly happy to honor my reservation. (I say &quot;mostly because the Twins won that night.)

There is a small lift (only enough room for a pushchair and one adult really) so my husband usually used the stairs with our 7yr old and I went in the lift with our youngest in the pushchair. We had a quad room, a main area with one double and an area with two single beds for the boys. There was a large wardrobe with lots of hangers and a free safe for use inside. The bathroom/shower room was lovely and clean and had a hairdryer and shaving point. There is a TV in the room but it is advertised on sites such as expedia that there is pay TV however when my husband asked he was told that this was no longer available, so the only english speaking channels that were available were BBC News24, CNN, Eurosport and MTV, but again this didn't really spoil our stay, our boys seemed to enjoy cartoons in the mornings even if they were in German! and the eurosport was ideal for our sports mad 7yr old.The location of the hotel was very central, about 7 minute taxi ride from the airport, a 15 minute walk to the leaning tower and other areas of interest, and a 15 minute walk in the opposite direction to the train station, and I have to say that we didn't see a nicer hotel in the area.Breakfast was continental and plentiful, and served 7am until 10am:  fruit, cereal, pastries, muffins, croissants, toast with preserves fresh pineapple and orange juice, tea and coffee (which was served with hot frothy milk - YUM!).The staff were polite and helpful, however I didn't find them particularly smiley, but I also found this to be true of most of the Italians that we can across during our stay - nice and helpful but not overly friendly.The only downsides (but again this didn't spoil our stay) were that there was no bath (which would be have been good for the kids) and there was no tea and coffee making facilities in the room and anyone travelling with children knows that you can be up very early, like 6am! and when breakfast isn't served until 7am and hour without a nice cup of tea can be hard but if I went again (which I most certainly would!)

123471206,I am not sure if I will stay here again or not. My best advice is to be sure and stay in one of the towers or be careful if you get one of the garden or ground level rooms. I had to ask for a transfer as there were people walking past and chatting after 11 pm and I had been up very early on the east coast. Then I was awakened at 4:30 with a food cart going by. I was transferred to the Royal Palm Tower and then slept very well. Internet was weak. Hotspots near restaurants so you could either wait on it in your room or find a hot spot. Bellman were exceptional! Desk staff as well. TV repairman came right away and took a few minutes but found the TV had to be reset and then had no more problems.Room was fine but it would have been nice to have drapes over the windows as it was very bright with the light outside the window at night. I did have my sleeping mask so that helped. There was a curtain rod but no curtain.  Otherwise the room was perfect.,1,0.6139246031746032

Other problems, when we arrived we were given keys to a room that had not been cleaned yet by housekeeping. We were immediately offered another room which had been cleaned. It appears that others have written about roaches and yet the hotel management does not take care of the issue. I guess they are not concerned since they are not the ones staying in the rooms.

I can't say anything about the beauty of this hotel that hasn't been said by anyone who has stayed there. This was my first experience with Fairmont Gold and I won't do it any other way if possible. Every single person that we came in contact with was pleasant, happy, helpful and made me feel special. Every time I walked into the lounge I was greeted by name. They made suggestions, They gave us tips. They seemed to genuinely care about our stay. I am sure a stay on the regular floors would be amazing too, but having the special lounge and concierge for just the 60 or so Gold Rooms lets them really give you personal attention. Having a nice breakfast each morning was a great perk. they always had eggs and either sausage or bacon. They also had little potato pancake type things, but skip those. All 3 morning I ate there I tried them and they were never very good. They also had lots of pastries (yum!), fruits, cereal, yogurt, and a coulee specialty items each day. The honor bar had a very nice selection of liquor, wine and beer. Also plenty of soft drinks and bottled water.  The evening snacks were appreciated as well.Our room, while on the smaller side, was wonderfully decorated and the bathroom, again, while small, made great use of the space and had a fantastic shower.

182765088,"It's fair to say that I had put in a ton of research when it came to planning the accommodations for our Honeymoon. And during that time, I'd witnessed this hotel basically rocket up the charts from the 9th-ranked property to its present listing at #6.And it's been well-earned... I would highly recommend this location.Scattered across three nights, we stayed in two separate rooms - the first two nights in La Onze, and the third night in Room 401, which is the spa suite. Candidly, if we had stayed in the spa suite for the entire stay, this would be a five-PLUS-star review. La Onze lowered the bar JUST a smidge.Let me explain...The spa suite is welcoming, with a ton of natural light making its way through the many windows on two levels. It just &quot;feels&quot; right... roomy, nice and clean, and impeccably so. As has been mentioned in several reviews, a spiral staircase leads to a second level, which houses a spa upon the deck, along with a daybed and tv inside. We spent a fair amount of time on the deck just enjoying coffee and the arresting view of the Place Royale. For a time, we also had a view of Cunard's Queen Mary 2 as it was anchored in the harbour (oh, please note: actual cruise line and ship may vary).By comparison, La Onze, while roomy, suffers from its location upon the ground floor of the complex. With little natural light, it doesn't help that the flooring and walls in the unit are likewise dark. It could probably use a little bit of room 401's light-wood touches... and it's compounded by the fact that you need to close the drapes in order to ensure privacy during your stay, thereby leading to a bit of a stuffy, claustrophobic feeling. I might add that we enjoyed a fantastic dinner in the adjoining restaurant, Toast... and also enjoyed absolutely wonderful complimentary breakfasts in the same restaurant each morning. Service was tremendous, with a front desk staff that is entirely accommodating and friendly. We were also given a bottle of sparkling wine for our Honeymoon and were greeted every so warmly by Erwan, the property's general manager, which was a tremendous touch.We'd stayed in the famed Fairmont Chateau de Frontenac on one night prior to our Le Priori stay and had a wonderful time there, but if there was a way to spend all four nights in the spa suite, we would have jumped at it in a heartbeat.

The first day our room got cLeaned the cleaners accidentally threw away my sons baby of baby food, formula and all his supplies. They say it was mistaken for garbage. After a mad dash to Target only a few minutes away is able to replace everything. They gave us a discount on our room.

And the staff are helpful and nice, and breakfast was great but it was our room that was terrible.The bathroom was dirty, grimy, full of cracks, mould etc. The toilet wouldn't flush properly all of the time and it smelt of urine in there. It was horrible. There wasn't a proper shower, just a bath with a shower head attached to the taps. When you stood in it it moved and felt like you could go through the floor. The decor in the bedroom was old but I can live with that, it was really the bathroom that was horrible and I considered asking to move but didn't through fear of getting a worse room, we were only there one night so we put up with it but I'd never go back. There is no way it's a 3 star hotel as it claims to be. Sometimes it's worth paying more.

One recent review complained about $ for parking and internet; I've never stayed in a big city where those weren't charged for. The fees were reasonable considering what I've paid in eastern US cities. Morning views of the city and mountains were wonderful. If you have access to the top floor breakfast and happy hour, they are worth the charge (being a Hilton owner,it was included in my charges). The Crystal City Mall area was very interesting, lots of very good restaurants in the area. The metro sky-train is only a block a way. The staff was excellent in their treatment of all guests.

Had we known at check-in just how uncomfortable the sofa bed would be, we would have insisted on the room with 2 queen beds.

10793947,"My wife and I stayed in the Farmers' Suite this past weekend.  This is a nice boutique-y hotel with a great location, close to the Grove and Beverly Center and an easy drive to anywhere on the West Side of LA.  The room cost $250/night, and for that I might have expected a little more.  Firstly, the Farmer's Suite is located right next to the elevator, so that people waiting to go up or down are waiting/talking/laughing/shouting right outside the front door of your room.  Second, I echo the concern about no hand soap.  Yes, there is a shower bar of soap, but nothing for the hands.  The sink area was a little small.  Third, there are no blackout shades in the room.  I am not a heavy sleeper, and so I was awakened at 7:00 each morning by the sunshine.  A nice touch if you want it, but I had fully intended to get some serious rest on this trip and the brightness of the room made that impossible.  Fourth, the comfy couch that is advertised is anything but.  It is small, with one large pillow, not at head level, and no armrests or throw pillows.  It was very uncomfortable to watch TV on (at 7 AM after being awakened).  Fifth, the TV and movie selection was quite subpar, and with great plasma TV's, one might expect a little better programming.  Finally the architecture of the room itself--I stubbed my foot three times on a little jutting piece of wall right at bedside.I might stay there again, but certainly not in this overpriced suite.",0,0.4948292448292449

Our room, a luxe terrasse, while not large, was incredibly well planned.  The space was very livable and we never felt crowded during our three night stay.  The terrace had a great view, but unfortunately the weather was a little too cold and blustery for us to use that space.  The bathroom was well above average and the shower was exceptional.  We really enjoyed the Nespresso coffee maker and the high quality teas (all complimentary) in our room.  Finally, I am delighted to say that the room was incredibly quiet.  I am a very light sleeper and I never heard anything through the walls of our room.What really makes this hotel exceptional is the staff.  I am hard pressed to remember a more welcoming and kind group, without exception.  Everyone greeted us with a smile and was more than happy to share suggestions on restaurants and things to see and do.  My husband kept saying &quot;Everyone is so friendly here!&quot;  We truly felt like valued guests.Quebec City itself is absolutely wonderful.  We took a walking tour and a tour of the Citadel.  The rest of our time was spent exploring on our own.  There was definitely plenty to see during our three day visit.  Needless to say, it is not difficult to get a good meal here.  We had a fantastic and surprisingly well-priced lunch at SSS.  Matto, right near the hotel, is excellent, too.  I recommend sharing several different courses.  The pasta seemed freshly made - delicious and the fish was so good that I am still craving it today!  We also had a dinner at the hotel's restaurant, Panache.   It was absolutely a first class experience and truly gourmet.  I don't want to eat like that every day, but I certainly recommend you dine there once during your visit.Lastly, be sure when you book your room that you opt for the bed and breakfast package.  Breakfast at the Panache restaurant is a delicious way to start your day, though I shudder to think how much it would have added to our hotel bill if our three breakfasts had not been included in our room rate!!",1,0.6245020230314348

A Mac computer on the desk, a huge TV and a kitchenette to do some cooking! You then spot the spiral staircase leading upstairs to the bedroom gallery ensuite! The colour theme is white and dark purple it's just lovely! Close to the QPark car park, a tesco and a few bars! Our room didn't have much of a view with the only windows being sky lights facing up!

77281830,"We were visiting Italy for 3 weeks racing around from Rome, Florence, Venice, Naples and the Cinque Terre. I knew we needed a break so we took a weekend and went to the beach in Tirrenia. The Grand Hotel is just that, GRAND. The rooms are nice, they remind me of rooms in a nice New Jersey shore/Miami beach hotel. The hotel is HUGE by Italy standards. The beach is very clean, the water very nice and the ocean has a sand floor at least 100 meters out. If you stay at the hotel you are allowed to sit at the orange umbrellas at the Imperiale beach. This is important as everyone has their own spot, we didnât know that. There are plenty of Orange umbrellas and chairs, but go early if you want some key spots, there are only 3 in the front row.   The included breakfast was one of the better ones I have had with coffee, cappuccino, salami, cheese, prociouto, rolls, fruit, eggs, juice and water. We did not eat other meals in the hotel. Instead walk a block up to the main street and there is a &quot;Gran Bar&quot; Pizzeria which has outstanding food. If you want a good spot at sunset they take reservations for the outside seats.  Then there are 2 good gelato places nearby.  All in all our experience there was great. It was a perfect beach weekend.  For those interested you can take a train to Pisa then a bus to Tirrenia.

The ceiling fan was so old and made so much noise (even worse on slow speed), that no one in the room slept well!  No cross breeze, so you got to keep cool somehow.  Luckily we only stayed one night, otherwise we would have gone crazy!  Bathroom floor was dirty too!  So basic was the room, that the shampoo was only a small tear-open towelett sized package!  The t.v. was mounted on the wall and the screen was smaller bigger than my Ipod!  But, then again, who has time to watch t.v.  However, the hotel was only a 5 min walk to the tower.  Parking is very, very difficult, so if you got a car...hmmm.  We got lucky and parked outside the wall on the main street, and since it was Sunday and a Monday holiday...parking was free.

Running routes are abundant and to stay safe I would recommend hitting one of the main roads running south (avoiding moss side) which will allow for an out and back of anything up to 12 miles.The hotel recommend using the Gym of a sister hotel next door (for a fee).

132041821,"When my partner was trying to book he couldn't get the spa suite for the dates we were going to be there.  Me being more cunning checked each day individually and discovered we were only unable to have it for the first night. ;) So we spent our first night in the junior suite next door then moved for the rest of our stay to the spa suite and I have to say both rooms are fresh and newly finished with excellent furnishings and decor.The junior suite itself was beautiful, the bathroom was out of this world and I enjoyed a nice relaxing whirlpool bath that night after many hours travel from the UK. The kitchen area has a Nepresso coffee machine and all the basic cutlery and china you would need. We only really needed the wine glasses!When we moved next door to the spa suite I was pleased to see it was very similar. Differences being a slightly bigger seating area with white leather chairs and the 3D tv. There was also a log fire that sadly we didn't get to try out as it wasn't cold enough - will have to come back in the winter for that.So that was my initial thought - then I came to the spiral staircase and made my way upstairs.... windows along 2 sides of the room looking out over Old Quebec and a raised daybed for relaxing on to enjoy the view. Then... stepping outside to the balcony - a sofa, 2 little tables and a hot tub all looking over Place Royale and the amazing wall mural.  I honestly don't think there can be a better room/suite in all of North America!The desk staff could not be more helpful.  I brought the wrong international plug with me, the girl on the desk had the place upside down trying to find one for me and then the manager arrived and kindly went next door to his own house and brought me his plug to use until I could purchase one.The breakfast was wonderful - so much choice. The creamiest scrambled egg I have ever tasted, crispy bacon, sausage, ham, cheese, cereals, yoghurts, delicious fresh pineapple and melon, apples oranges, bananas. Bread, bagels and english muffins and delightful squares of granola bar. I'm sure I missed something but you get the idea!There was work being done to the planters and on the outside patio while we were there (which didn't affect us at all) and I'm sure it will be lovely to sit out in during the warm summer months.I particularly liked not having to walk through the hotel to get to our suite building - it felt just like walking home and going indoors. And even better was that housekeeping had been in and waved their magic wand while we were out! Again the girls here did a wonderful job - the room was spotless after they had been in.The hotel is a stones throw from Place Royale and all the beautiful little shops round about there. The funicular takes you straight up to the top to the Terrasse Dufferin at the Chateau Frontenach without going round the windy streets - although it is a lovely walk up too.We had an amazing stay in Quebec - the suite, the staff, the breakfast and the location all add up to a first class experience that we can't wait to repeat.",1,0.568350900307422

He has in depth information about Italy in general but Pisa, his heart and soul, specifically.  He is ready to suggest the how, what, and where in Pisa including Museums, Botanical Gardens, Schools, eateries and so on... he wants you to know all about his city.

And, once inside you will be treated to an elegantly appointed room complete with complimentary snacks and coffee - there is a complete wine bar in room - other drinks and snacks available in the mini fridge.  Each room has a laptop for your use!  And the rooms are sparklingly clean and modern.  Breakfast is more food than you can consume and again, be ready for your history lesson bright and early.  Michele and his B&amp;B are a definite stay - not to be missed.  He is a wonderful host in a great city!  Put it on your list of places to go and things to do in Italy!

41855374,"I booked the hotel La Pace in the centre of Pisa for a business trip for 6 nights.  I was supposed to stay at the hotel for 6 nights, however after seeing my room after check-in, I checked out 10 mins later and decided to cut my losses and pay for one night and go straight to a nicer hotel - the myhotels galielei.  If your a budget travellor, or someone who literally likes to rough it, then this is not a bad place, but if your looking for comfort, luxury and service then this is not the place to go! The receptionists reaction on reception said it all when I checked in when I told him I had a booking for six nights - and he replied &quot;six nights here!&quot; in astonishment and shook his head.Whilst it is conveniently located to the airport, the train station and the leaning tower of Pisa, the hotel is very dark, depressing and dirty.  My room was not clean at all - the extra towels, pillow and blanket were just dumped at the bottom of the wardrobe.  There were stains on the bed covers and side of the bed. Dust and hairs all over the room as well.  I though I could attempt to rough it for atleast one night, but when I saw a massive spider climb up the wall next to the bed I had to leave.  The whole place is like something out of the house of horrors.  Weird and strange place!!! I don't recommend this hotel to anybody except if your looking for one night to rough somewhere in Pisa.",-1,0.4897916666666667

What stood out the most was the excellent service we got from the entire staff. We requested an extra sheet for the bed, and got it immediately. We asked if they could help us with making reservations, and they not only did, but they printed them for us also. But the best of the Best, was Kim.We had requested a taxi to take us to the bus station. That day, the lower area had a wine festival (we didn't know in advance, or we would have stayed another day there).Because of the festival, (and because Sir Paul McCartney was staying at a nearby hotel), the cab never did appear. Kim made arrangements with another hotel to drive some of our group, and she personally drove the rest of us with her own car to the station.

In addition, each night, there was at least one or more additional items - nachos/chicken tenders/etc. We arrived early in the morning and they were able to give us our room which was extremely nice. Staff was EXCELLENT. Every staff member we came in contact with was extremely helpful and friendly. Shuttle was efficient - ran every half hour.Only negativesThe pool was ok...a little smaller than pictured and chilly but the room was heated and the indoor/outdoor feature was nice. On the sunny days, outside pool was nice. The room had a desk, reclining chair and two dressers. Would have preferred a table with chairs over the 2nd dresser so we could play games in the room. Not a real problem....we just went to the lobby and used the tables there. Biggest complaint was with Travelocity. They were supposed to reserve a double bed room and booked us into a single king. My grandson was coming up for the weekend from his military base so it presented a little bit of a problem for one night. Their comment was they couldn't guarantee the room and we would just have to see if we could talk to the front desk. There were several soccer ball teams here when we checked in so there were no roll-away beds. We made do but it would have been better if they had made the reservation correctly to begin with. Will not book through them again.Overall...excellent experience.

But this is a budget hotel, so you're paying for the location.Having said that the room looked modern as well and was clean and comfortable, with all the basic essentials, including a hair dryer, extra pillows and tea and coffee making facilities, as well as hangers and a wardrobe. You will probably need the air-con on, but we hated the fan noise so slept without it which was a bit stuffy.Very good shower.Slightly annoying bathroom fan-noise too which we ended up blocking with toilet paper so no problem after that.

Upon entering, we immediately noticed how strongly it smelled of smoke (much stronger than any other casino we've ever been in). Our room was spacious enough and clean, though dated somewhat in appearance. The toilet in our bathroom leaked a bit and the brass towel racks were all scratched up as well. The wallpaper was peeling off in a spot or two. Our toiletries were not replenished at all during our stay, but we didn't bother to call about it. The price of course is ridiculously low. My husband and I aren't big gamblers, so thought we would enjoy some time by the pool. We were surprised at how small the pool was and that there were no poolside servers. It is more like any backyard pool rather than a pool for a large casino. There is a TGI Fridays near the pool, which we were able to get drinks from and ate at a couple of times. The food and service there was very good. There is a bar by the pool, but it wasn't open at all during our 4 day stay.

216088595,"I read the many reviews of this hotel, did my homework and it was what I expected. Our room was clean, great maid service every day. You're not gonna get a Marriott 5 star hotel but then again they don't advertise as such. Smack dab on the beach in the heart of the Ocean Beach neighborhood of San Diego, everything you need is right there, clubs, restaurants, beach shops, rentals, bars. The neighborhood has a good vibe, if you're looking for the neon blandness of the suuburbs, ain't gonna find it here. We had no problems with this being an older hotel, like I said I read the reviews and I could quickly filter out the sour grapes from the genuine reviewers. I went with the genuine ones and they proved to be the more accurate ones. We went to San Diego for surf, sun and sand and the OB hotel fit our needs perfectly, I would and will definitely stay again. My only one disappointment?

AVweZN42_7pvs4fzClpB,"This is a really wonderful hotel! We booked two rooms for our stay. We were there at 3pm and we were able to check into only one of them because the other wasn't finished being cleaned. They were going to call us when the other room was ready. We waited around for about an hour and we finally went back in and asked. We reserved a room with a balcony- well, they didn't have one. Even after waiting for an hour, they didn't have a room for us. We stood up there waiting for about 30-45 more minutes, and they decided to give us a room with a kitchen, living room area and a fireplace in lieu of what we reserved. I have to say, they were very accommodating and we appreciated the extra space. They were very nice and did all they could to make it right- and we were very happy about our room when we finally got it!! Now, on to the free breakfast that is offered....it is amazing!!! Biscuits, white gravy, oatmeal(with all kinds of toppings to put in it!), bacon, grits, eggs, hash browns, cereal, toast, bagels(all types of cream cheese and butter and jellies), coffee, hot chocolate, apple juice, cranberry juice, orange juice and milk...there was sooooo much!

215717738,"Old warm charm oozes from this property.  The Fairmont company has maintained this property well.  Service was attentive and efficient.  In the new wing is the spa, fitness center, and outdoor patio seating, like you're in a mini park.  Great views and is central to everything in the old quarter.  Not much public space, reception takes up most of the lobby.  While I had a large room with a partial view of the river, care must be taken to secure a room on a level above floor 5, as most of the lower rooms would have an obstructed view, if at all.  Fairmont members receive free wifi.  Room had refrigerator, K-cup coffee machine, and flat screen TV.  The family room at 550 square feet has a nice sitting area to entertain, and is well worth the extra money.  Eating here would be a challenge as the hotel has two restaurants that could never be able to accommodate all of its guests if the hotel was full.The hotel deserves all five stars, but the dining room is currently not fully open.  We were put on a waiting list for dinner both nights, because, I as told, &quot;the dining room was fully booked.&quot;  When I called the front desk for help, I was assured I would get a table because I was an in-house guest. When my party was brought to our table, I asked if we could be seated in the main part of the room, and again was told the dining room &quot;was fully booked.&quot;  During the 2.5 hours we enjoyed a wonderful meal, but the restaurant remained less than a third full.  There were at least 15 tables around us that never had any patrons.  My guests were curious, and I was embarrassed.

My husband was here for a conference, and I was lucky enough to leave the snow engorged east coast and spend time in sunny Burnaby.  This was a large room with king size bed, covered with duvets, which to me adds so much luxury and comfort to a persons nights away from home. The food at this hotel was good.  This hotel is within a short walk to Metrotown which is a huge mall.  The hotel also close to sky train which enables you to go quickly into Vancouver.  I did not use the hot tub or pool..The pool is basically one of those pools which is only for the recreation of doing laps, I forget what they are called but you get my drift I am sure.  Free internet, for us anyway, coffee maker and small fridge and hairdryer were in the room. Buffet breakfast or regular are provided for a price.  Fairly expensive but on pare with other hotels of this calliber.  Joined to the hotel is the Crystal Mall which provides the locals of Chinese descent, with familiar products and makes an interesting stroll for hotel customers.

The location of the Pensione is ideal for visiting the main attraction, has easy access to the bus lines, numerous restaurants and bars in the neighbourhood and we were not disturbed by outside noise.The room was on the third floor with no lift, as we only had hand luggage, not a problem. The room was small but large enough for us. The wardrobe was too big for the room however contained hangers and spare blankets. Two single beds that were quite comfortable despite my oversized self with bedside tables and lamps and a flat screen TV attached to the wall above a small table with two chairs completed the room. The en suite bathroom provided toilet, shower, bidet, sink with mirror and shelf. Two towels were also provided for each occupant. The towels were replaced and bins emptied every day during our stay.

Helvetia also offer a garden/patio area from which it is possible to see tortoises, terrapins, domestic rabbits and cats, pets of the owner.Whilst the rooms were simple and did not offer the height of luxury, there were a couple of things that went a long way, in my book. During the wet weather it was possible to borrow umbrellas. It was possible to leave your bags before or after check in/out in a locked area.

492413680,"We stayed in a Gold Level room, and had access to the 14th floor lounge, and its deeply wonderful breakfasts and 5-7 PM snacks, which were dinner for us almost every night. The only downside is you don't get out to Quebec's lovely restaurants as much as you might, but having paid extra for the gold level, it's sort of incumbent on you to use it. The staff are fabulous - very well trained and nice people and they help you a lot if you ask. The pool and gym are also both very good, well worth using. We stayed for 5 days so went there twice a day.My only reservation is that when we booked, it was for a smallish 'queen' room, and was quite a reasonable price, facing inward. When I asked for a 'king' room, the 'only one available' was if we upgraded, at a not vast but definitely noticeable cost. The 'king' room had a king sized bed, but was very very small, and faced the city. So we asked for a larger room - and they said, but this was the room size you originally booked - WHO KNEW? Still, they then gave us, at no further extra cost, as slightly larger room, also with a king sized bed - this was much better. Walking around the hotel, you see into rooms and notice a wide variety of sizes and layouts - so when you book, be very very attentive to what you're booking. With 650 rooms they have lots of grades and views. Probably this hotel is best if you're staying a while - enjoying it takes a few days, but, minding the caveat about choosing your room size, bed size, view, and perks, we would certainly go back.",1,0.5689655172413794

100194387,"For the purpose of my review bias, for the last 10 years I have stayed approximately 100 nights a year in hotels,  this is broken down into (per year) 75 nights within the Intercontinental  Group / Holiday Inn group of hotels (this incorporates the Holiday Inn Express chain), the other 25 nights are split between Best Western, Hilton &amp; privately operated hotels. I stay predominantly in the Holiday Inn group because of  2 main reasons, 1 ) is their loyalty points scheme which up until the end of 2010 was probably the best hotel loyalty scheme in the world, 2 ) the locations/ proximity of their hotels to the jobs that I am working at. I currently stay at the Holiday Inn Express at Hamilton 6-10 times per yearThe Holiday Inn Express at Hamilton is a great little gem of a hotel in the Express chain franchise, for many years I stayed at the nearby Holiday Inn Express âStrathclydeâ (some 2 miles away) but after disillusionment of that hotel I now choose to stay at the Hamilton Express for the past 2 yearsMy ongoing experience of the hotel is as follows, arriving can sometimes be a little awkward for the newcomer as most modern Sat Nav systems do not take you to the shared communal car park that the hotel shares with its adjoining retail park, cinema and ASDA superstore neighbours. Often at peak times this car park can be crammed and parking can be difficult (if they owned and operated the car park opposite for free I would have awarded it 5 stars). The parking restrictions in the shared car park mean that you cannot leave your car parked here during the working day so care should be taken to avoid  this or a heavy fine will be due. On arrival at the hotel the check in staff are welcoming and friendly (it is very rare to queue). Check in is simple and easy. The reception area is the typical open plan bar, breakfast and dining area which is always well kept, tidy and clean. The rooms are exactly what you would expect from a Holiday Inn Express in the sales brochure, clean, tidy and branded, I have never had a dirty room at this hotel. Depending on your rooms orientation to the car park  or rear during the summer if you choose to sleep with the windows open on a warm night a mixture of either finely tuned boys racer cars exhausts or choice local language    can be heard on certain nights, my tip would be to use the AC and close the double glazed windows. The breakfast (itâs free) is now  the typical Holiday Inn Express âpart English, part continentalâ which is a mix of croissant and  or sausage/ bacon and a powdered scrambled egg mix, with toast, the odd pastry and machine orange and coffee. This hotel is not particularly close to any restaurants which are at the other end of the town. The hotel does however provide an evening meal service which I have not tried ( after 7 years using  the hotel chain I decided enough was enough with hotel food). The hotel as stated above is in the middle of a small retail park which contains an ASDA, McDonalds and Pizza Hut. As with most Holiday Inns they are happy to let you order in from local takeaways (menus are available from behind the bar) Check out, is normally a pain free process with the helpful staff, in summary 4/5 for an excellent Holiday Inn Express that just needs its own car park to score 5.",1,0.4894004216269841

Thanks to the recent remodel, the inside of the hotel is as impressive as the outside.  The location is central to all the key attractions in Quebec City.We stayed in a deluxe king room with courtyard views.  It was a remodeled room which I highly recommend for the extra money.  We were in room 9072 which required taking a flight of stairs or another elevator from the 8th floor.  The additional little hassle was well worth it.  It was a corner room with views of the roofs of the other hotel sections and over the courtyard and then great views of the city, river and mountains.The best part of the hotel was the staff.  Everyone from the valets to the conceirges were extremely helpful and friendly.  Prior to our stay, I had emailed the concierge asking for a recommendation for a restaurant at which we could celebrate my daughter's birthday while in Quebec City.  Upon our arrival to the room, their was a plate of pastries and a note from the hotel staff wishing my daughter a happy birthday.

The rooms are on the small side and the bathroom very compact, but everything you need and even mini fridge and safe. The bedding and towels were extremely clean and replenished daily! All you need for a comfortable stay, after all we didn't go to Pisa to stay in the hotel all day. It was a 10/15 minute pleasant walk to leaning tower, plenty of cafes/bars/restaurants/shops enroute. Safe city to wander around, good atmosphere. Had a day trip to Florence  by train 7.80euros each way, excellent journey taking just over an hour, would recommend it.

On querying this with reception, I was informed that it is only free if you book your room through the hotel website and not through a site like &quot;Expedia&quot; or &quot;Hotels.com&quot;.  The hotel should really make this distinctiion clear on their website.  Had I known, it may have altered my decision on whether or not to use the service.

The rooms were average, I've stayed in better and I've stayed in worse.  The convention center was really nice &amp; fancy looking.

The &quot;smoking area&quot; was 7 feet from the main elevator  and you had to walk through a cloud to get to your car.  It would come up the elevator all the time.  Plus, people are smoking right outside their room and it comes in the vent for the air conditioner.  I looked up CA law and it says 20 feet away is minimum.  The rooms are clean, but this time found black mold in the shower. So all in all, cheap but not the healthiest place to stay.  Sorry to say this, but we won't be back.",-1,0.4683982683982684

We loved the location as we were near all of the sites and districts we wanted to visit, but so much quieter and less âhecticâ than the Upper Town.      Our room was pleasant, comfortable and meticulously clean!     We enjoyed the use of the hotel bikes for rides along the St Lawrence and Charles Rivers. The included breakfast was delightful, with reasonably priced up-grades available (my husband loved the Eggs Benedict). The breakfast service was effecient, even during crowded times. We got a âkickâ out of the self serve wine and alcohol stations, but they were a nice amenity to have for that evening cocktail.      The greatest asset of all was the exceptional staff.

93607785,"Just got back home from a 5 night stay in this wonderful hotel in Pisa and I am happy to say that I was not dissappointed with my choice. I booked hotel online and was told that I would be paying 335 euro for five nights, with breakfast included, for a double bedroom. We were also to be charged 10 euro a day for parking our rental car in the hotel car park,. After staying in three star hotels with similar rates I thought this was a good deal and booked. On arriving at Hotel Bologna and checking in we were immediately told that since we were staying for five nights, we were getting a discount  on parking, so we were off to a good start. The hotel receptionist was very friendly, helpful and efficient. She gave us a map of the city and highlighted the main sights of interest as well as some local restaurants we might enjoy and some shopping areas. Piazza dei Miracoli, that's where the leaning tower of Pisa is, is only about ten minutes away by walk. A nice stroll over the river Arno through Borgo Stretto is a great experience within itself. Therefore location was also very good.Our room was spotless, large and comfortable. Airconditioning was available but the room was quite warm therefore we didnt even bother using it. A small minibar was present, with free bottled water and a nice assortment of affordable snacks and drinks. Bathroom was also very nice with a heater to keep nice and warm and a large bath/shower, very comfortable for soaking in after a day of running around Tuscan villages and cities. Breakfast was included in price on booking and was great! A huge selection of different foods was present including pastries, eggs, bacon, cereal, yoghurts, dozens of different breads (all fresh and yummy) and delicious pastries. I am a coeliac and was extremely happy to see a small gluten free section with some bread, crackers, mufins and biscuits.All in all I have to say that Bologna Hotel is one of the best hotels I've stayed in during my travels. Very clean, comfortable, friendly and inviting. The only tiny issue we had was the fact that our room was just above the street, so on certain mornings we got a bit of noise from the traffic and buses passing through via G. Mazzini. Of course this is something which cannot really be controlled, and it wasn't really a significant issue, we still got plenty of good sleep in our comfortable bed :) Would definately visit again if I return to wonderful Pisa.",1,0.609375561545373

Firstly, what may concern you. The bathroom was frankly a bit scruffy - probably clean enough but had enough &quot;60's student digs&quot; about it to be slightly worrying. The room furniture was rickety at best, except the bed which was marvellous. Had a bit of bother opening the windows, but then the view along the Arno was great. Breakfast was fine, food was fresh, although not altogether stunning. Didn't eat there in the evening so can't rate the restaurant service/quality. I wouldn't get in the lift either - it was a bit worrying. Man on reception was a bit odd. Can't quite put my finger on it, just a bit odd - not unfriendly though. Just odd. The first hour we were there was also spent waiting for a plumber to sort something out, although we weren't aware of the problem. But then: You're paying to stay in a museum. Just go for a wander round, it's amazing. I took over 50 photos inside, most of them in sepia! There are photos of bygone ages all around, libraries, statues, ballrooms, clocks, even a 1920's office perfectly laid out. What on earth they think they're doing I don't know - it's like 2 buildings in one - the rooms and the museum, it's just that they don't tell anyone about the museum!We only stayed for one night, which, slightly unkindly, is probably all Pisa deserves - you do the tower and field and it's pretty much done (although we loved it for that). Eating, of course, was excellent and despite it being August the climate and smell were fine - no it doesn't stink!There is also a nice little roof terrace for drinks and snacks. If you have any sense of adventure about you, stay here. If you are concerned, do it for one night, and book somewhere else. But you do have to stay here, to say you have.

We were supposed to meet another couple but unfortunately they couldn't make it because Anne- Marie broke her ankle shortly before the trip. So, we got to the Saint Hotel that Sunday after being dropped off by a taxi that we took from the airport. I would have never believed that something so beautiful would be behind the front doors that we entered. Once inside,the place was magnificent! The room, the pool, the bar/restaurant area were all so nice! I would be remiss if I did not mention how friendly and personable the staff was, particularly Gustavo Lobo and Maria. Gustavo was so helpful and friendly. He was so pleasant to be around. He went out of his way to help us, especially when we were at the pool. And Maria, she was so personable and a pleasure to talk to. Both were outstanding people! Wish we could have stayed longer! We mistakenly left a bag of gifts at the hotel when we had already left for home and after calling the hotel to see if we had left it there, it was sent back to our home within five days! Great place, both hotel and island!!!!!!!!!Thank your for this amazing review.Please be sure that I will share this comment with Gustavo Maria. They make us proud everyday by providing a genuinely caring service to our guests.In addition, we are flatted that you truly appreciate the unique decor and saintly vibe of our establishment. And it is true that the Saint is full of surprises and mystery...On the other hand, I am sorry to hear that your trip with us was too short, but note that we will always be pleased to have you here in Key West.",1,0.6673835125448029

There was a live cockroach in the clock of the microwave, the toilet overflowed, no hot water, the hot tub was filthy, the drain was broken in the bathtub and when we asked for extra blankets we were given &quot;rubber-like&quot; blankets that had not been washed! The location was adjacent to the freeway right next to a noisy car dealership and no outlet to the west of the street, so there was only one way into the property. When I voiced my concerns to the front desk clerk (Anna) was VERY rude. I informed her I was not going to pay for my room and I would be finding other accommodations. I told her she could either take it up with her manager or I would dispute the charges with my credit card company. She must have spoken with her manager and the charges were adjusted but only after I had to make a three way call with my credit card company to the property because Anna refused to do so!

It is absolutely necessary seriously renovation be done!Everything is too old, you feel there like find yourself in an antique shop. Maybe long long years ago, at that old times the building was something great, not for these times! There was even a kinda weird strong sent in the room, no AC, no fridge in the room and in our room there was absolutely no internet signal! Also the warm water stream was missing for sink, only for the bathtub; In general there was a problem with both electricity and water â unstable! Better to donât use the wardrobe-awful smell inside and very noisy doors and be careful with the glass shelves in the bathroom too why they are also very unstable.Beside that spacious room, comfortable bed, good toiletries, room storage, all the staff very kind and close to good Cafes and restaurants.",0,0.6444444444444446

Check in was quick and pleasant, the housekeeping staff was very dependable and all other employees that we encountered went out of their way to help.  We have been coming here for over 20 years and the service has never been better. The lobby can get a bit crowded but you are in the major attraction of the city. Once you get on the elevator to your room, there is a quietness, elegance and sophistication to experience.  We were in a suite with magnificent views of the river and to add to its historic charm it once was the residence of a former premier of Quebec when he was in town.

Comfy bedding and great shower. The room included a complimentary breakfast, which was really great - maybe the best I've had of its kind. The breakfast is in the adjoining restaurant, Il Matto, which was lively and hopping in the evenings as well.

The location, first off, is fantastic - step out the back of your hotel and you're literally at the lifts and in Whistler village. We checked in 4 hours early and we got both of our rooms right away, perfectly clean.The rooms were a good size, very comfortable bed, ample sized bathroom and a stocked kitchen area (which I didn't realize it would have).Staff were all friendly, and we couldn't hear noise from any of the adjoining rooms. What I love most about this hotel is that it's pet friendly, and when we were there, some sort of dog convention was going on - so lots of furry friends milling about!The hot tub/pool isn't large but it's a good size and the waitress in the bar/restaurant provided us with plastic cups so we could have a few drinks in the pool.All in all, absolutely NO complaints about the Hilton, we'd not hesitate to stay here again, and at $99/night in the summer time, you just can't go wrong!

The room was beautifully decorated and spacious and the bed very comfortable.  The food in the restaurant was excellent, but don't be in a rush.

AWEw3i5yRxPSIh2RsYCd,"Booked for a convention over a Friday thru Saturday recently, It was prudent to reserve my stay on the premises, although my customer loyalty cards recommended the hotel across from the golf course. Prices were not as low as many reviewers state for this hotel, two weeks prior the event but relatively expensive Friday and Saturday night stays (almost double the workweek day rate - and almost all hotels do this in Las Vegas, some more than others). Flights expensive from the East Coast this year, Saturday return some 100 cheaper than flying back on Sunday - and the red eye flights leave close to the date changeover time.The next shock came finding out about getting there from and to McCarran Intl. airport - it's apprx. 17 miles in distance, taxicab 60...70 when arriving late night! But what the hotel staff did not readily disclose - ther's a low-key bus (WestCliff Express) for two (2) dollars, that takes about 50 minutes (while still running along the highways) and makes its final scheduled stop less than a quarter mile/400m from the hotel entrance! Other participants of the convention took out rental cars (the hotel shuttle, price not known, last leaves hotel or airport by 6pm, so you're out of luck on eastbound red eye flights, that's where the bus really pulls its weight...)Enormous lobby areas greet you and hefty puffs of cigarette smoke - almost like good ole Europe (used to be...). The area appears more cluttered (efficiently equipped) with money machines than in some other hotels on and off the strip, making it a challenge to find your orientation and the concierge area, at first.Yes, the personnel really is friendlier here than in town, instead of the allocated room on the third floor, I requested one on a higher level and was granted one with an outstanding view of the golf course and the mountains. Clean room, with separate sink area vs shower/toilet area, albeit fixtures telling their heritage closer to the 80s than the 2000s. A flat screen TV (not HD)with a very limited program but a few music channels that are worth mentioning (and I couldn't turn it off at the end of a two night stay, not via remote or on the mainframe!) The biggest drawback were the enormous 4 AC motors below (the size of B757 engines) and their significant noise when at least two of the four fans were continuously running - mind, we had 107F (40C) outside temps during the day...Too bad, despite the weekend room rate surcharge, wi-fi was available only at another surcharge of 12,99/day, and amazingly, I managed without. No group discount (considering the conference) had been negotiated.A very opulent breakfast bar greets the all-nighter not before 8am on weekends, keep your gambling registration card handy as it will give you 2 meal discount, but prices are really reasonable for Las Vegas, the quantity or the quality. Likewise the prime rib dinner buffet, good job, guys! Please tip the friendly staff like Easterners...A solid good, not quite very good and I decisively wish to criticize the very draughty, excessively chilled conference rooms on the second floor (near the bingo hal) with no possibility of adjusting climate control clearly spells out that this hotel isn't latest generation any more.Would I recommend it heat-soaked LA drivers might find their sanctuary here, it's not close to the strip, but if you don't need access to downtown daily and are a little more cost conscious, this might just be your choice for a few days.

Also there was not a peep to be heard which we weclomed as my fiance is a light sleeper.Breakfast was excellent in comparison to the rest of our trip.  After breakfast here the following days standard at ohter B&amp;B never matched our first mornings.

We've sampled quite a few B&amp;Bs in the City, so we stand firm in our opinion that it is, by far, the best B&amp;B in St. John's.  With respect to accomodations, Leaside offers something for every taste.  If Victorian romance is your fancy, you will not be disappointed ~ the Port Royal &amp; the Parker boast frills and femininity and will impress those true romantics.  If sexy and contemporary is more your bag the Trinity and Bonavista will more than satisfy your appetite ~ these suites have modern furnishings with clean lines and a European feel (they also have their own entrances which is ideal for those of you who can't get past that idea that staying at a B&amp;B feels like you're having a slumber party at a stranger's house).  The Argentia and Bakeapple suites also boast contemporary decor and afford guests a unique blend of sleek and romantic ~ the Bakeapple is sizeable and has an excellent seating in which to relax ~ the Argentia is dark and masculine and feels like a hideaway with its sloped ceilings and dark walls.  With respect to service,  Leaside's staff are fantastic and have always gone out of their way to accomodate our every request in a timely fashion.

The hotel is well located about half a kilometre, 15 minute walk from the train station, and fifteen minutes the other way to the tower. We spent very little time at the hotel other than breakfast which had a great selection of cereals, meats, cheeses, yoghurts etc. and was more than adequate for our needs. We arrived late due to flights so missed the hotels free shuttle service to the hotel from the airport but utilised this on the way back which is a great added service. If you need to get a taxi from the airport it cost us 10 euros, and took 10 minutes to arrive so a great location for an airport hotel.Our rooms were great, although the bed was a little too firm for my particular taste they were clean and well decorated with en-suite facilities, well stocked and reasonably priced mini bar and serviced every day. There is free wifi so its easy to keep in touch with the world and I would stay here again if we go back to Pisa.We found the hotel staff very friendly and helpful so I was a bit surprised by some of the the other reviews. Clean well presented hotel in a quiet back street but near enough to bars and restaurants to enjoy your evening time in Pisa. Nearby discovered a great restaurant, the Hostaria Le Repubbliche Marinare, great food and well worth a visit of an evening and a two minute walk away.We visited Florence on the train for a day out. Cost is 16 euros each return, trains every half hour and don't forget to validate your tickets in the machine on the platforms before travelling - to avoid being fined (we weren't by the way as we remembered to do it).",1,0.482882882882883

(The following night another member of staff insisted that, contrary to what I was told earlier, all the hotel's rooms were non-smoking, and that Italian law dictated an ash tray had to be in every room - for 'emergency use'...). Other TripAdvisor reviews also flag that smoking is allowed in all rooms.I also didn't find the room particularly clean, with hairs left in the bathroom.

Sunday was another wedding with music so loud we might as well have been attendees. I understand that hotels need to host these functions in order to remain solvent, but the hotel also has the responsibility to warn their guests that their room will be directly over Party Central and offer an alternative. This hotel gave no such warning. We would never have stayed here if we'd known, and we will never stay here again. Our money was poorly spent. The management was unapologetic.

It looks tranquil and welcoming.Spa:  I went with my spouse who has been here a few times in the past with her friends.  I  have never been here and kept an open mind.  Stay for the day or overnight in one of their cottages.Treatment:  Really only went in for an hour massage which was pretty good and professional.  There are a variety of things you can schedule depending on how much you want to run around and spend, such as yoga, mud bath, blah blah.Facility:  There is are a few key places to point out.  The main building has change rooms below ground with day lockers, showers, steam room and Jacuzzi.  The main building has a main lounge area with some tea and biscotti, a gift shop, a lounge area to meet for treatments, a dining room, a eucalyptus steam room (too strong for me), a grotto on the outside with a one person cold plunge, four person hot tub, and a one person lap pool (which really does not work because there is no current to swim against).  The main outdoor pool is nice, but as with all pools, not enough pool furniture to meet the demand.  The only thing that saves you on a hot day is that people frequently rotate to go to their appointments.  There are chairs outside to relax in and do nothing - including a few hammocks.  The spa is located on an old farm so it has plenty of land and views of the rolling hills.  Other activities could be hiking, a 15 minute walk to the gym in another building, a visit to their bakery on site, stables, The robed cult:  Maybe its just my spa inexperience, but I found it strange how everyone walked around in a white hooded robe. Food:  Quite good.  The lunch menu was concise with a few nice choices, but portion sizes are small.  We had tried the wild salmon and the burger.  The afternoon tea again is a nice light snack of sweet, savoury or fruit plates.Price:  It is sure pricey for relaxation, but worth a treat once in a while I suppose.",1,0.472511574074074

We compared this room with our travelling companions' Superior Room; theirs was so much better that we raised the issue with the hotel staff.  We then discovered that we had been given a Classic Room and that the hotel was very full!  To their credit the error was addressed at our insistence and a better room provided, but it did waste a lot of our time in being sorted out.  Generally the hotel is comfortable and clean, although a little cramped.  This must be expected given its quaintness and the great location compensates.  Breakfast crowding means that you had better be there early to get a table and be served promptly.  Recommended despite the room mixup.",1,0.5634313725490196

114147448,"Just arrived back home after a week in Pisa, at the Hotel Bologna. What a fabulous Hotel, it is so well situated just a short walk over the Arno River and youâre in the centre of Pisa shopping area and continue walking and youâre at the leaning Tower.  Or leave the Hotel and turn left and within a few minutes easy walk your at the railway station.As a solo traveller I was made most welcome by ALL the staff at the hotel from the moment I made contact via a phone call to the reception once I had landed. I was picked up in minutes by the courtesy minibus, which was immaculate. My checking in was a pleasure, the entrance lobby is amazing with the art work painted on the walls and spotless. I proceeded to my room was a single room but to my surprise the bed was a Â¾ bed which was really comfortable. The amenities were spotless, the shower itself was superb, unlimited hot water and a good pressure. Flat screen tv, mini-bar, desk and writing paper plus air-con. Also the room was very quiet, you could open the double glazed window and allow fresh air in but you still had adjustable shutters on the outside to give privacy.In the morning the breakfast was wonderful, with a superb choice of food from just fresh fruit to bacon and scrambled eggs. Cakes were being baked fresh as you were having breakfast, and were beautiful. Fresh coffee was on hand both Italian and American style along with water and fruit juice. The dining area was continually being kept clean and tidy for the next guest that would sit at the table. It has all be said before no doubt but the Hotel Bologna is superb value for money and friends and family couldnât believe the quality I was getting for the price. As a solo traveller you can pay over the odds, but not here. If your in any doubt, donât be. Book a room now you wonât regret it.If your planning on visiting other places as I did, Lucca, Florence, Siena, Viareggio then the reception have the train timetables for you, and for other destination and no doubt if not to hand they would get them for you. Easy to understand and you have the wonderful Hotel Bologna to come home to after a hard days sightseeing, and a glass of wine on the terrace.Sorry if ive gone on a bit but I loved my stay at the hotel bologna and could go on more, but try it for yourself .......you wont be sorry!!!Anthony MatthewsSouth Wales, UK",1,0.5392551892551892

I had a single room with en-suite which was all very spacious and clean although a bit tatty but more than adequate for the bargain price I paid.  Good breakfast but some fresh fruit would have been nice. Very helpful man on the front desk, in fact couldn't have been nicer.  Pisa itself a bit of a dump but this hotel more than made up for it and cheaper than many B&amp;Bs.",0,0.4904761904761904
82420147,"We had planned this visit, for a while. We were all excited coming, having looked at the website and other source pictures. After receiving the special promotion, we booked the one night stay and had no hesitation to upgrade and book treatments. We stayed at the Sentosa West. On arrival we were impressed about location and the general appearance of the buildings and the landscape; it was a very promising start. We were shown around and then had to hurry to make it to our gentle walk. We enjoyed our walk very much.We are happy now that we booked for a Monday/Tuesday, because I âm not sure how this would have worked on a busy weekend.  The womenâs locker rooms were crowded and my wife had to stand in line to use a washroom, because other guests used them as change rooms. It seems wherever we turned the relaxing experience was spoiled by overcrowded hot tubs, steam rooms and waiting rooms. In the treatment/waiting room the coffee dispenser leaked and then ran out and was not refilled.Our itinerary between the English Tea, massage and trying to get into our room was to tide and not relaxing. The general experience at meal time was disappointing. The menu is well written and promises a great experience which is not upheld by the food when it arrives. The staff seemed to be very nice, but quit unorganized when the room filled up. We were in a timely fashion at dinner and breakfast and received a table by the window. We enjoyed the view and the lovely table and our beverages. Due to check-out and complications with our Bill we were late for our last meal. We had to sit in the âdark roomâ with hardly any lighting and no natural light it felt very inadequate. As an overall food experience, from the salty cheese cake to the unwashed and unpeeled vegetable to the dry bacon and solid cooked pouched egg it was not up to the standard that was portrait in the brochure. The stay at the cottage was mediocre. We defiantly enjoyed the surrounding at the cottage; the pond the view and the deck are very nice. The room is spacious. The bathroom even so it seemed newly renovated was with cheap finishes, plain mirrors and poor workmanship, not what we expected from such a renounced Spa.We did not feel to voice our opinion and complain during our stay because this was to be very relaxing and we did not want to get upset any further, trying to make the best out of the stay that we had. We did contact the owner after receiving the standard &quot; Give us your opinion&quot; Email, but received no reply.",1,0.5403334588117196

Candy, who helped me in the restaurant, was very pleasant and helpful, and Tanner at the front desk was also helpful in retrieving an errant FedEx package.

The room was clean when we arrived and housekeeping came every morning to clean and verify all was well and if we needed any additional towels, toiletries etc. Their breakfast area was clean, the food was hot and fresh and there was plenty food to go around. I read some guests didn't like the breakfast voucher system but my husband and I liked them because we have stayed at other hotels where there is more people in the breakfast area than there is food. Their Wifi went down while at their business center, they informed me that the system was running slow and that their service provider was on property trying to fix it. I let them know that I was in the middle of a Disney ticket purchase and the front desk staff immediately got their own personal Hotspot set up on their front desk computer. They let me finish my Disney ticket purchase/transaction from their desk....yes from their desk... which i didn't expect. I was really happy cause that saved us alot of time and hassle. The hotel is close to WDW and plenty of dinning. It was overall a wonderful stay, nothing to complain about...other that they could accommodate me the extra day we decide to stay, but that was our fault since we did it last minute.

The room was great with a fireplace (if you need any additional logs for the fire ask the cleaners nicely and you can get them for free, they normally cost $10), full  Kitchen including dishwasher huge fridge freezer and breakfast bar.  The bathroom was also great with a jet bath.Breakfast was âcontinentalâ but on some days this included cooked foods.  We booked with Virgin and received continental vouchers but these could be used to order any item from the menu.  I ate eggs Benedict  all week and didnât get charged they just took the vouchers.All of the staff were great at the hotel and really made a fuss of our 2 year old.We used Child care for a couple of days at the Westin hotel next door which was great.  If you are taking young kids there is plenty to do apart from playing in the snow.  There is a softplay centre a short stroll from the hotel and a sports centre with large in door pool and ice skating rink a $10 taxi ride away.  Whilst away we had a need to visit a doctor in the village this no problem and cost $120.There are plenty of restaurants in the village that are child friendly.In short the Hotel is great, the resort is great and skiing is out of this world.  I only have one problem and that is the price of the drinks, these were very expensive.  Oh and just one other thing Cider is made from apples.  It is not made from Cranberry or Pomegranate  or Pearâ¦.only apples,  when it is advertised as âHot Ciderâ I do not expect a sachet of powder with hot water.
